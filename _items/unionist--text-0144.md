transcription: <p>  Mr. Editor,—I have just received the following invaluable communication
  from <br>  Hon. Wm. Jay, of Bedford, Westchester, Co. N. Y. a man of the highest
  <br>  respectability. Unfortunately it was not mailed until three days after it
  was <br>  written; else it might have reached this place in time for the late trial
  of <br>  Miss Crandall,—and who knows but the opinions of such men as Clinton, and
  <br>  King, and Van Vechten, and Kent, and Jay might have shaken even Judge <br>  Daggett’s
  confidence in his own opinion, respecting the citizenship of colored <br>  people?
  <br></p><p>  Being, as I am, fully persuaded, that <br>  <strong>    the learned
  Judge has given his sanction to an erroneous notion, that may do <br>    inconceivable
  mischief in our country, if it be not corrected <br>  </strong>  . [this turned
  out to be all too true] I am most happy in being able to lay <br>  before the community
  in connection with his, the opinions of men who have held <br>  the highest rank
  at the Bar, on the Bench, in the Halls of Legislation, and in <br>  the Executive
  department of the States. Yours truly, Samuel J. May <br></p><p>--</p><p>  Bedford,
  30<sup>th</sup>  Sept. 1833 <br></p><p>  <em>Rev. Sir.</em>  —On the late trial
  of Miss Crandall, it was thought expedient by her opponents <br>  to attempt to
  deprive our whole free colored population, of the protection of <br>  the Constitution
  of the United States, by denying that they were <br>  <em>citizens.</em>  Should
  a second trial be had, it is possible that the annexed authorities may <br>  be
  of some use and I will therefore commit them to your care, as I have not <br>  the
  honor of being acquainted with Miss Crandall’s counsel. <br></p><p>  With sincere
  respect for your exertions in the cause of humanity and freedom, <br>  I remain
  Rev. Sir&nbsp; Your very ob’t servant, WILLIAM JAY <br></p><p>--</p><p>  Extracts
  from ‘Reports of the proceedings and debates of the Convention of <br>  1821 assembled
  for the purpose of amending the Constitution of the State of <br>  New-Yor.’ By
  N.S. Carter and W.L. Stone. <br></p><p>  On a motion to insert the word ‘white’
  before the words ‘male citizens’ in the <br>  article of the Constitution regulating
  the right of suffrage. <br></p><p>  ‘I would submit to the consideration of the
  committee whether the proposition <br>  is consistent with the constitution of the
  U. States. That instrument provides <br>  that ‘Citizens of each State shall be
  entitled to all the privileges and <br>  immunities of citizens in the several States.’
  No longer ago than last <br>  November, the Legislature of this State almost unanimously
  resolved that ‘If <br>  the provisions contained in any proposed constitution of
  a new State, deny to <br>  <em>any citizens</em>  of the existing States, the privileges
  and immunities of citizens of such new <br>  State, that such proposed constitution
  should not be accepted or confirmed, <br>  the same in the opinion of this Legislature
  being void by the Constitution of <br>  the United States.’ Now Sir, is not the
  right of suffrage a privilege? Can you <br>  deny it to a citizen of Pennsylvania
  who comes here and complies with your <br>  laws, merely because he is not six feet
  high or because he is of a dark <br>  complexion.’ —Speech of Peter A. Jay, p. 184
  <br></p><p>  ‘No longer ago than last winter the Legislature of this State almost
  <br>  unanimously resolved ‘that their Senators be instructed and their <br>  Representatives
  requested to prevent any State from being admitted into this <br>  Union which should
  have incorporated into her constitution any provision <br>  denying to the <br>  <em>citizens</em>  of
  each State all the rights, privileges and immunities of citizens of the <br>  several
  states.’ These instructions and requests it is well known, <br>  particularly referred
  to Missouri, and were founded on a clause in her <br>  constitution interdicting
  <br>  <em>this very class of people</em>  ‘from coming to or settling in that state
  under any pretext whatever.”— <br>  <em>Speech of R. Clark, p. 189</em></p><p>  ‘Suppose
  a <br>  <em>negro</em>  owning a freehold, and entitled to a vote in Vermont, removes
  to this State, <br>  can we constitutionally exclude him from the privileges of
  voting? The <br>  constitution of the United States provides that <br>  <em>citizens</em>  of
  each State shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of <br>  citizens
  of the several states.’— <br>  <em>Speech of James Kent, (the Chancellor,) p.</em>  190
  <br></p><p>  ‘The constitution of the United States is beyond the control of any
  act of any <br>  of the States. It is a compact to which the people of this in common
  with <br>  those of other States are parties, and cannot recede from it, without
  the <br>  consent of all. With this understanding, what let me ask, is the meaning
  of <br>  the provision quoted by the gentleman from Albany (Mr. Kent.) Take the
  fact <br>  that a <br>  <em>citizen of color</em>  entitled to all the privileges
  of a citizen, comes here—he purchases a <br>  freehold—can you deny him the rights
  of an elector incident to his freehold? <br>  He is entitled to vote because like
  any <br>  <em>other</em>  citizen he is a freeholder, and every freeholder your
  laws entitled to vote. <br>  He comes here, he purchases property, he pays your
  taxes, conforms to your <br>  laws—how can you then under the article of the constitution
  of the U. States <br>  which has been read exclude him? The gentleman from N. York
  thinks that the <br>  meaning of this provision in the U.S. Constitution extends
  only to civil <br>  rights. Such is not the text, it is <br>  <em>all</em>  rights.
  This seems to me to lay an insuperable barrier in our way. <br>  <em>    As certainly
  as the children of any white men are citizens, so <br>    certainly&nbsp; the children
  of black men are citizens.’—Speech of Rufus <br>    King, p. <br>  </em>  192. <br></p><p>  ‘It
  seems to me that some gentlemen entertain doubts whether any of our people <br>  of
  color are in a legal sense citizens; but these doubts are unfounded. We are <br>  precluded
  from denying their citizenship by our uniform recognition for more <br>  than forty
  years—nay some of them were citizens when this State came into <br>  political existence—partook
  in our struggle for freedom and independence, and <br>  were incorporated into the
  body politic at its creation. There is another and <br>  to my mind an insuperable
  objection to the exclusion of free citizens of color <br>  from the right of suffrage,
  arising from the provision of the Constitution of <br>  the U.S. that the citizens
  of each State shall be entitled to all the <br>  privileges and immunities of citizens
  in the several States.’— <br>  <em>Speech of Abraham Van Vechten, p.</em>  193.
  <br></p><p>Letter from De Witt Clinton, Governor of N. York to President Adams.</p><p
  align="right">  ALBANY, 4<sup>th</sup>  Sept. 1826 <br></p><p>  Sir,—I have the
  honor to enclose copies of the proceedings of a&nbsp; <br>  respectable meeting
  in West Chester County in the State, and of an Affidavit <br>  of John Owen, by
  which it appears that one Gilbert Horton, a free man of color <br>  <em>and a citizen
  of this State</em>  is unlawfully imprisoned in the jail of the city of Washington,
  and is <br>  advertised to be sold by the Marshal of the District of Columbia. From
  <br>  whatever authority a law authorizing such proceedings may have emanated, <br>  whether
  from the municipality of Washington, the Legislature of Maryland, or <br>  the Congress
  of the United Sates, it is at least void and unconstitutional in <br>  its application
  to a <br>  <em>citizen,</em>  and could never have intended to extend further than
  to fugitive slaves. As <br>  the District of Columbia is under the exclusive control
  of the National <br>  Government I conceive it my duty to apply to you for the liberation
  of Gilbert <br>  Horton as a freeman, <br>  <em>and a citizen,</em>  and feel persuaded
  that this request will be followed by immediate relief. <br></p><p>I have the honor
  to be &amp;c. DE WITT CLINTON.”</p>
