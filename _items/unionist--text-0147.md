transcription: '<p align="center">ANOTHER SPECIMEN!!</p> <p><em>To the Editor of the
  Liberator,</em></p> <p>   DEAR SIR—The following, which was received through the
  Post Office a few days   since, may be published in the Liberator, if you think
  proper. We wish to have   it come before the public in order to show the opposition
  of certain white   people to the education of their colored brethren. The letter
  is given, word   for word, and letter for letter, as they stand in the original.
  It seems to us   it would be well for   <em>‘twelve’</em>   students of a literary
  institution to pay some attention to spelling. In the   words   <em>‘colord’</em>   and
  ‘   <em>peacable’</em>   for example. </p> <p>To young Beman.</p> <p>   A no. of
  the students of this university, deeming it derogatory to themselves,   as well
  as to the university to have you and other colord people recite here,   do hereby
  warn you to desist from such a course, and if you fail to comply   with this   <em>peacable</em>   request,
  we swear, by the   <em>ETERNAL GODS!</em>   that we will resort to   <em>forcible</em>   means
  to put a stop to it. </p> <p>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   <em>Twelve
  of us</em> </p> <p>   <em>     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Wesleyan     University.   </em> </p> <p>The following was on the outside of the
  letter:</p> <p>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   To

  junior </p> <p>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   The
  P.M. will please </p> <p>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   to
  forward this   as&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Middletown
  </p> <p>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   soon
  as possible </p> <p>   An explanation of the foregoing may not be out of place,
  and will place the   subject in a stronger light before your readers. It is well
  known to those who   have perused the Liberator during the past year, from the facts
  given in the   2d No.,of the present volume, that a colored man of the name of Ray
  was   formerly a student in the Wesleyan University, and that he was under the   necessity
  of leaving it (the university) on account of the prejudices of   certain students.
  We are informed that the person who sent letters to the   Liberator, which he had
  received relative to Mr Ray’s leaving, incurred the   severest displeasure of those
  prejudiced students. It is probably known that   he was not then a member of the
  university. The excitement however soon passed   away, and in the course of a few
  months he entered the university. As the   subject of the above letter wished to
  pursue certain studies, instruction was   given him in that student’s room. Mr Beman
  recited three times each week, and   for a considerable time was unmolested other
  than by the reproachful terms of   a few base fellows as he passed to and fro from
  his recitation. His conduct   towards others was ever such as to merit a gentlemanlike
  deportment from them,   but this he did not receive. When those disaffected students
  found that   reproaches did not deter him from pursuing his course of recitations,
  they   resorted to other means. In going out from the university on a certain   morning,
  a quantity of water was thrown upon him, by which he was   <em>completely drenched.</em>   Some
  time in the course of the next day one of the party interested in the   affair caused
  a notice to be put up, calling a meeting of the students, that   evening, the spirit
  of which was such as to lead many to think it was written   by one not unfriendly
  to Mr Beman. This trick however was discovered, and   exposed at the meeting before
  mentioned. When the meeting was open ed, that   <em>very person</em>   who wrote
  the notice, and who, there is strong reason to believe, was   concerned in insulting
  Mr Beman, rose and   <em>     offered a resolution disapproving the conduct of those
  engaged in that     affair.   </em>   After the subject before the meeting had been
  with much warmth discussed, and   a request having been made that the student who
  then instructed Mr B. would   hear him recite at some other place, the meeting was
  dissolved. &nbsp;This   request, for the sake of producing harmony among the students,
  was, in form,   complied with, but owing to the subsequent advice of some friends,
  the   recitation went on as before, till the college vacation. Since the   Commencement,
  for the convenience of him who is instructing Mr B, the   recitation has not been
  heard in the university. All went on very well till   this letter was received,
  which has produced much excitement and unpleasant   feeling. It will not prevent
  the instruction that may be desired however. </p> <p>   In this letter there is
  one thing not very consistent, and, to a certain   extent, unaccountable; that is,
  that such a request and such a threat should   be made when the subject of it does
  not recite in the university. It may be   that there are certain ones who are unwilling
  that the colored people should   be educated in any way whatever, and are endeavoring
  to drive those who may   wish to pursue any course of study from their places of
  instruction. But we   feel thankful that the   <em>‘Canterbury law’</em>   has no
  effect in this case, for the subject is not a   <em>‘foreigner.’</em>   ” </p> <p>   The
  foregoing facts may be relied on, for we have received them from those who   are
  immediately acquainted with the circumstances. </p> <p>   The Unionist and Emancipator
  will confer a favor by copying this   article.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   TRUTH
  </p> <p>MIDDLETOWN, Conn. Sept. 1833.</p> <p></p> '

  Given the proximity between Canterbury and Middletown, The Unionist was the closest
  Abolitionist newspaper. If The Unionist republished this article, it would most
  likely have been in the November 6, 1833 issue
