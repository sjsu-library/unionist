transcription: "<em>Extraordinary Expedition.</em> —A merchant of Manchester wanted
  1,500 pieces of calico of a particular description, printed in 3 colors, to send
  of the next day to America; not finding them at any of the warehouses, he went to
  Harpur Ley, to Mr. Lockett’s, who had nothing printed of the kind he wanted; this
  was at five in the evening, and it was necessary to have the goods in Manchester
  the next day before one to go by the Rail Road to Liverpool. Mr. Alsop who is at
  the head of Mr. Lockett’s establishment, said he was willing to undertake the order
  at his own risk, he did so, the pieces were printed in three colors, dried, glazed,
  packed and sent off to Manchester by 12 o’clock; they reached Liverpool at three,
  were put on board, and the vessel sailed at 5, just 24 hours after the order was
  given! "
