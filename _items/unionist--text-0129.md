transcription: "<em>Extraordinary Expedition.</em>—A merchant of Manchester wanted
  1,500 pieces of calico of a particular<br>description, printed in 3 colors, to send
  of the next day to America; not<br>finding them at any of the warehouses, he went
  to Harpur Ley, to Mr. Lockett’s,<br>who had nothing printed of the kind he wanted;
  this was at five in the evening,<br>and it was necessary to have the goods in Manchester
  the next day before one to<br>go by the Rail Road to Liverpool. Mr. Alsop who is
  at the head of Mr. Lockett’s<br>establishment, said he was willing to undertake
  the order at his own risk, he<br>did so, the pieces were printed in three colors,
  dried, glazed, packed and sent<br>off to Manchester by 12 o’clock; they reached
  Liverpool at three, were put on<br>board, and the vessel sailed at 5, just 24 hours
  after the order was given!<br>"
