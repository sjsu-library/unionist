transcription: "<p>  RIVERS.—There is a wonderous beauty, a mysterious charm, in flowing<br>
  \ waters.—Seldom does painter, poet, or novelist, attempt to sketch a scene of<br>
  \ surpassing loveliness, but a “smooth stream,” a “murmuring rivulet,” or a<br>
  \ “tumbling cascade,” forms a prominent feature in the glowing landscape. Their<br>
  \ fair images of human perfection, must chaunt their joys to “babbling<br>  brooks”—must
  sigh out their griefs to an accompaniment of aquatic melody, and<br>  “mingle their
  tears with the torrents as they fall.”<br></p><p>  Nor do rivers appear by any means
  contemptible in the pages of the historian.<br>  Who has not heard the fame of the
  Nile, that source of Egypt, prosperity, and<br>  that proverbial emblem of a truly
  benevolent man? As signs the poet,<br></p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  “Bounteous<br>  as the Nile’s dark waters,<br></p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  \ “Undiscovered as their spring.”<br></p><p>  And who has not read of the Jordan,
  which beheld the course and fled backward<br>  at the approach of Jehovah’s chosen
  tribes? Of the Granicus, where the world’s<br>  conqueror first met and scattered
  the countless hosts of Persia? Of the cold<br>  Cydnus, which had well nigh checked
  the rash victor’s headlong career? Of the<br>  sacred Ganges, whose waters cleanse
  from moral pollution? Of the yellow Tiber,<br>  that laves the walls of the Eternal
  City? Of the Rubicon, where the aspiring<br>  Roman decided between his ambition
  and the better feelings of his heart, and<br>  threw the torch of civil war among
  the combustible materials of the old<br>  world’s proudest empire?<br></p><p>  The
  traveler who visits lands renowned in ancient story, finds nothing in the<br>  relics
  of their former grandeur, better fitted to impress the mind with that<br>  sensation
  of pleasing sadness which memorials of other days call up, than the<br>  broad streams,
  {unreadable due to a fold} reflected tower, palace, and temple,<br>  glittering
  in the sunbeams, and whose shores echoed to the ceaseless hum of a<br>  crowded
  city’s busy population, where now, solitude, desolation, and silence,<br>  reign
  amid the fallen arches, the broken columns, and the mouldering ruins of<br>  structures
  which the vain architect of former days reared in ponderous and<br>  massy strength,
  as if defying the destroyer Time. How forcibly is he impressed<br>  with the vanity
  of human greatness, as he surveys the quiet stream, rolling on<br>  its channel,
  heedless of the desolation around, unchanged by the mighty<br>  revolutions that
  have swept from the face of day, cities, states, and<br>  empires—regardless alike
  of chieftains, kinds, and conquerors, who once dyed<br>  its waves with the purple
  tide of slaughter, or received on its banks the<br>  homage of conquered millions,
  and of the slaves who basely bowed the knee in<br>  servile adoration, to the mortal
  god. The noble Tigris still holds its onward<br>  course, unaltered since the haughty
  walls of Nineveh overhung its banks, and<br>  her six score thousand inhabitants
  who knew not the right hand from the left,<br>  listened to the prophet of the Lord
  warning them of speedy destruction. The<br>  famed Euphrates ceases not to flow,
  though the “queen of cities” is a desert<br>  waste, and long ages have elapsed
  since Chaldea heard the voice of wailing and<br>  the loud lament, “Babylon is fallen,
  is fallen.” Xanthus and Scamander still<br>  water the plains of Asia Minor, though
  the towers of Priam have crumbled into<br>  dust, and the bright glory of Ilium
  has vanished like a vision of the night.<br></p><p>  And when the grave in its silence
  and its gloom shall have closed over all of<br>  life and activity the earth now
  contains; when the grand and beautiful works<br>  of art which we behold, shall
  be as the magnificence of Babylon or of Troy;<br>  when we shall have taken up our
  abode in the cold chambers of darkness, “and<br>  the places that now know us shall
  know us no more;” when our names shall fall<br>  on the listener’s ear like the
  faint echo of a distant voice, or the dim<br>  recollections of a half forgotten
  dream; when the finger of decay shall have<br>  erased the records of our achievements,
  and our deeds shall be remembered as<br>  the traditionary legends of antiquity;
  when the generations that succeed us<br>  shall have faded from the earth like the
  passing shadow of a thin and fleecy<br>  cloud; the lovely streams by which we delight
  to rove, will still wind through<br>  the vallies [sic], diffusing verdure and fertility
  in their path; the cataract<br>  will still leap “in thunder and in foam,” from
  the rocky brow of the<br>  precipice, sending up its sparkling spray to glitter
  in the dazzling<br>  sun-light, and to crown its front with a halo of varying and
  respondent hues;<br>  the calm and stately current of the might river will still
  sweep on in majesty<br>  to the ocean, shaded perhaps by the thick boughs of the
  giant oak or gloomy<br>  pine, and fringed with shrubs and blooming wild flowers,
  where<br>  <em>we</em>  behold reflected in its pellucid mirror, the spire of the
  village church, and<br>  the thickly crowded habitations of men; and where now it
  visits but the forest<br>  haunts of roving savages and beasts of prey, or glides
  through glens untrod by<br>  human footsteps, and undisturbed by voice or sound,
  save the ripple of the<br>  waters below &amp; the rustle of leaf and branch above,
  shall then be seen the<br>  snow-white sail wafting along its tranquil tide the
  rich product of<br>  agricultural industry and commercial enterprise.<br></p><p>
  \ A new race shall have risen to possess the heritage of their fathers, to walk<br>
  \ among the ruins of our splendid edifices, to gaze on the streams that we<br>  admire,
  and while they gaze, to muse as we do now, and as hundreds before us<br>  have done,
  on the fleeting evanescence of earthly fame, and the shadowy<br>  illusiveness of
  human grandeur.<br></p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  “So passes<br>  this world’s glory.”<br></p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: This newspaper, <em>We, the People</em> is one for which Charles C. Burleigh
  briefly worked. They would prove to be a strong ally to the cause, as can be seen
  here in the accompanying story from their October issue.
