transcription: The N.Y. Daily Advertiser quotes the Traveller [sic] as saying, on
  authority of a gentleman from Connecticut, that Miss Crandall had dismissed her
  school, in consequence of the late decision of Judge Daggett. The Brooklyn Unionist
  of the 10th inst., contains no intimation of that character, and we presume it to
  be a mistake. Indeed we know, that the School has been visited since the decision,
  and every thing found going on as usual. Several scholars are about to be added
  to it.
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: Here William Goodell states that he trusts <em>The Unionist</em> over
  a major New York City paper. This is of course, somewhat partisan in nature, but
  it is also, in this case, accurate. The school did not close after Daggett's ruling,
  but instead flourished for almost another year.
