caption: Captain Paul Cuffee (1759-1817). It is remarkable that these trials, in their
  effort to legitimate Black citizenship, became ersatz workshops in an emerging understanding
  of Black history. While the Black students at the Canterbury Female Academy likely
  knew much of this, the significance given to the history of figures like Paul Cuffee,
  let alone the immediate bearing of these trials on their education, likely made
  the knowledge ever more deeply resonant.
