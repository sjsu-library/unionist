transcription: "<em>Mahomedans.</em>â€”A traveller [sic] says, that during his long
  residence at Malta, and constant<br>course of commercial transactions with the professors
  of the Mahomedan creed, he<br>never heard of an unpaid debt, or a violated obligation:
  and that it is a usual<br>mode of traffic in the market towns, throughout Turkey,
  for the farmers and<br>hucksters to leave their fowls, eggs, butter, &amp;c. in
  baskets with the prices<br>fixed, and to return in&nbsp; the evening in perfect
  security of finding the<br>article as they left it or the exact price deposited
  in the place of just so<br>much as had found a purchaser.<br>"
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: Many of the radical abolitionists were among those also arguing for religious
  tolerance. This article, in its candid assessment of Islam, and therefore its sideways
  critique of Christianity, is a sign of this gradual change underway (and this, despite
  the cringe-worthy "Mahomedan" moniker)
