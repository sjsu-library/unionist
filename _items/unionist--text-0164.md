transcription: Two men in Chatham, Ct. lately saw, according to their own account,
  an angel! To<br>one of them the celestial visitant appeared three different times,
  revealing to<br>him a future famine and an earthquake. Now we see no propriety in
  trying to make<br>it appear as something very strange to see an angel. Such sights
  are by no means<br>rare in Brooklyn. We see some half dozen every day—and by happy
  smiles that so<br>beautifully curl their pouting ruby lips we should suppose they
  were thinking of<br>things more agreeable than famine and earthquake. Ours are intellectual
  angels<br>withal, for we usually see them with a book under one arm—and—and—but
  we are a<br>confirmed bachelor and dare not venture another word upon the subject.<br>
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: Because William Burleigh was teaching at the Canterbury Female Academy,
  it is likely he wrote this commentary about his angelic students. This was as defiant
  of racial norms as was the naming of the school for "Young Ladies and Little Misses
  of Color." Similar to that move, it may sound discordant to our twenty-first century
  ears, as if this was a salacious comment, but I doubt it was intended that way.
