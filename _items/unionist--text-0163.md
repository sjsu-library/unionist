transcription: The cause of Temperance prospers well in Massachusetts. Our good friends
  there<br>are doing nobly—they have their heart in the work. MR. FROST, the Apostle
  of<br>Temperance, and an eloquent and able man, has been lecturing in Norfolk County,<br>and
  his labors have been attended with the most gratifying success. Those of our<br>friends
  who have had the pleasure of hearing Mr. F. will not be surprised at<br>this. He
  possesses to an eminent degree the power of awakening and enchaining<br>the attention.
  His oratory is peculiar to himself—at least we never heard of its<br>model or successful
  imitation—always elevated and always fascinating. His voice<br>is musical—his gesticulation
  forcible, and, more than all, his acquaintance with<br>his subject in all its bearing
  is perfect, and his facility in rightly arranging<br>and applying sarcasm and argument,
  ridicule and persuasion, truly wonderful. By<br>Mr. Frost’s report it appears that
  when he commenced his agency in the County,<br>there were twenty-eight Temperance
  Societies, embracing 6,511 members, to which<br>have been added 2,375 others, and
  fourteen new societies have been organized,<br>embracing 761 members. This tells
  well for Temperance effort in Massachusetts.<br>Let our Connecticut friends do likewise.<br>
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: I have not yet determined if the hyper-active Temperance Advocate Daniel
  Frost is the same as the Daniel Frost, Jr., of Canterbury (1787-1863), who was among
  the opponents of the Canterbury Female Academy.
