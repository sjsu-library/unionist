  The cause of Temperance prospers well in Massachusetts. Our good friends there
  are doing nobly—they have their heart in the work. MR. FROST, the Apostle of
  Temperance, and an eloquent and able man, has been lecturing in Norfolk County,
  and his labors have been attended with the most gratifying success. Those of our
  friends who have had the pleasure of hearing Mr. F. will not be surprised at
  this. He possesses to an eminent degree the power of awakening and enchaining
  the attention. His oratory is peculiar to himself—at least we never heard of its
  model or successful imitation—always elevated and always fascinating. His voice
  is musical—his gesticulation forcible, and, more than all, his acquaintance with
  his subject in all its bearing is perfect, and his facility in rightly arranging
  and applying sarcasm and argument, ridicule and persuasion, truly wonderful. By
  Mr. Frost’s report it appears that when he commenced his agency in the County,
  there were twenty-eight Temperance Societies, embracing 6,511 members, to which
  have been added 2,375 others, and fourteen new societies have been organized,
  embracing 761 members. This tells well for Temperance effort in Massachusetts.
  Let our Connecticut friends do likewise.
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: I have not yet determined if the hyper-active Temperance Advocate Daniel
  Frost is the same as the Daniel Frost, Jr., of Canterbury (1787-1863), who was among
  the opponents of the Canterbury Female Academy.
