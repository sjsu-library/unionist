transcription: "<em>Dignity.</em> —A new made Justice of the peace, into whose office
  some dozen of his neighbors had followed a constable with a vagrant in charge, to
  see how the magistrate would make out, determined to strike them dumb with awe.
  He sentenced the poor culprit to twenty hours’ imprisonment—and concluded with all
  possible solemnity, “And the Lord have mercy on your soul!” "
