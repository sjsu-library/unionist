transcription: TO CORRESPONDENTS. The communication signed Vox, is deferred for want
  of room to insert it this week. We are compelled to omit that, or the circular of
  Messrs Adams and Judson, and as we last week promised the circular an insertion,
  we feel bound to give it the preference. Vox shall appear in our next.
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: To stay true to its word concerning printing all sides, <em>The Unionist</em>
  delays publishing a letter to the editor in order to run the circular from Judson.
