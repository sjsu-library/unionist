transcription: "“We see it stated in the “Unionist,” a paper published at Brooklyn,
  Ct., that a memorial is in circulation in the eastern part of the State, the object
  of which is, ‘the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia.’ Persons frequently
  put their names to papers of this description without sufficient reflection, and
  on the exparte statement of those who are interested, or have an object in procuring
  signatures. Our object in penning this notice is to caution the public against the
  movements of the fanatics, and to request every intelligent man to consider well
  what he is about before signing this memorial. It as a scheme fraught with dangerous
  and alarming consequences—a project that cannot be executed—and the very attempt
  to effect it, threatens the tranquility of the Union. We regard these movements
  of the northern agitators, in as infamous a light as those of the southern nullifiers,
  and they should meet with universal condemnation. It has been intimated that some
  of our members of Congress would countenance this insane project: but we do not
  believe that the madness of party desperation will carry any one of them so far.
  Let no man sign this memorial who loves his country and would preserve the Union.” "
scholarlyNotes: Guessing at the date in Windham paper of 1833-11-20, and the issue
  number of The Unionist here
commentary: 'The notice about this petition could have appeared in late October or
  early November 1833 in the <em>Unionist.</em> Resolutions to end slavery in the
  District of Columbia were passed at the New-England Anti-Slavery meeting in January
  1833, and the American Anti-Slavery organizational meeting in December 1833. Samuel
  J May introduced the resolution, which was seconded by Crandall lawyer William Ellsworth
  in the American Anti-Slavery Society December meeting. So a local campaign in eastern
  Connecticut, spearheaded by the Unionist, seems logical. '
