transcription: "“We see it stated in the “Unionist,” a paper published at Brooklyn,
  Ct., that a<br>memorial is in circulation in the eastern part of the State, the
  object of<br>which is, ‘the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia.’ Persons<br>frequently
  put their names to papers of this description without sufficient<br>reflection,
  and on the exparte statement of those who are interested, or have an<br>object in
  procuring signatures. Our object in penning this notice is to caution<br>the public
  against the movements of the fanatics, and to request every<br>intelligent man to
  consider well what he is about before signing this memorial.<br>It as a scheme fraught
  with dangerous and alarming consequences—a project that<br>cannot be executed—and
  the very attempt to effect it, threatens the tranquility<br>of the Union. We regard
  these movements of the northern agitators, in as<br>infamous a light as those of
  the southern nullifiers, and they should meet with<br>universal condemnation. It
  has been intimated that some of our members of<br>Congress would countenance this
  insane project: but we do not believe that the<br>madness of party desperation will
  carry any one of them so far. Let no man sign<br>this memorial who loves his country
  and would preserve the Union.”<br>"
scholarlyNotes: Guessing at the date in Windham paper of 1833-11-20, and the issue
  number of The Unionist here
commentary: The notice about this petition could have appeared in late October or
  early<br>November 1833 in the<br><em>Unionist.</em>Resolutions to end slavery in
  the District of Columbia were part of the New-England Anti-Slavery<br>meeting in
  January 1833, and the American Anti-Slavery organizational meeting in<br>December
  1833. Samuel J May introduced the resolution, which was seconded by Crandall lawyer
  William Ellsworth in the December meeting. So a local campaign in eastern Connecticut,
  spearheaded by the Unionist, makes sense.<br>
