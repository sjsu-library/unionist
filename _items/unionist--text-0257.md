    MELANCHOLY ACCIDENT — Yesterday afternoon, (Wednesday 5
    <sup>th</sup>
    inst.) about 5 o’clock P.M. just as the William Penn, with about 150
    passengers, from Baltimore, had come round the point, below this city,
    (Philadelphia,) she was discovered to be on fire near the furnace. The
    rapidity of her motion creating a strong draft, and the very combustible
    nature of every piece of wood near the fire, soon rendered it certain that the
    boat would be lost. She was accordingly run ashore on the muddy margin of the
    river, before reaching which she seemed to be in one full blaze. Here the
    passengers jumped out; and most of their baggage and part of the great
    Southern Mail were thrown ashore. Many of the passengers jumped overboard. A
    steamboat went down and brought up from the wreck most of the passengers to
    the usual landing place.
  </p>
  <p>
    We learned late Wednesday evening, that the dead bodies of a gentleman and
    lady were taken from the river.
  </p>
  <p>
    Several lives were saved by the hazardous exertions of persons belonging to
    the boat, and by those who were drawn to the scene. From the great number of
    passengers, and the confusion consequent on such an awful scene, it was
    impossible to ascertain with any degree of certainty the extent of personal
    injury sustained.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some of the passengers stripped themselves, jumped into the river and swam
    ashore—they were taken up almost perishing from the cold.
  </p>
  <p>
    It was mentioned to us that a lady in company with the Rev. Dr. Mitchellmore,
    of Lewistown, Del. jumped into the river in her consternation. Mr. M. followed her
    and was drowned. At our last information hopes were entertained of recovering
    the lady.
  </p>
  <p>Col. Joseph S. Porter is among the drowned.</p>
  <p>One man drifted out into the river on a settee, but was finally saved.</p>
  <p>
    When the boat was run ashore, she run with her bows into the mid, and her
    stern in deep water—the fire was raging so intensely in the centre of the
    boat, as to prevent the passengers who were aft, from going forward—they
    therefore jumped into the water beyond their depth.
  </p>
  <p>
    We regret to add, the lady mentioned above, died between 8 and 9 o’clock. She
    was in a delicate state of health. The body has been removed by the Coroner to
    Cherry Hill, where it will remain for a short time, for recognition.
  </p>
  <p>
    The fire took in the wood house. The boat was burnt to the water’s edge—the
    loss sustained is about $70,000.

commentary: One of the five people who died was described as a prominent Connecticut
  businessman. Another of the five, Rev. John Mitchelmore (1793-1834), held a pastorate
  in Delaware; there is more on him, including a picture, in this <a href="https://mitchelmore.one-name.net/families/trees/tree09.htm#0319">family
