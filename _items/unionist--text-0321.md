transcription: "<em>Important Discovery.</em>—We are informed by two gentleman who
  lately passed through Syracuse, that, N.Y.<br>that Mr. Avery, proprietor of an extensive
  iron foundry in that place, has made<br>a most important discovery in relation to
  the casting of iron. The best kind of<br>earth used in foundries, is brought we
  believe, from Canada. Mr. Avery analyzed<br>this earth and found it to contain proportion
  of blue clay. Following this up by<br>a series of experiments, he discovered that
  if common fine sand was mixed with<br>common blue clay in the proportion of one
  tenth part of clay to nine tenths of<br>sand, it would constitute the best composition
  for casting that he had ever<br>used. The most delicate casting came out free from
  sand; requiring no cleaning<br>by vitrol. He dismissed 10 of his cleaners on the
  spot. Mr. A. has taken out a<br>patent for the discovery, and thinks it will make
  an immense saving the expense<br>of iron foundries.—<br><em>Inquirer, Brattleboro.</em>"
scholarlyNotes: 'p. 255-257 of this book has more information on Avery: https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/aja2321.0001.001/278?page=root;rgn=full+text;size=100;view=image'
commentary: William Avery (1793-1840) was an inventor and manufactorer in New York
  State. His Syracuse iron foundry, E. Lynds & Co, helped revolutionize transport
  on the Great Lakes and the Erie Canal (see https://www.maritimehistoryofthegreatlakes.ca/Documents/Engines/default.asp?ID=s005
  ). In his final years, he worked on the Illinois and Michigan Canal, but died suddenly
  before his part of the job was complete. Prudence Crandall would later live near
  the start of this canal in Mendota, Illinois. Avery had many patents to his name,
  but the most important was the Avery rotary engine, as described here - https://uh.edu/engines/epi1884.htm
  . An article in <em>Scientific American</em> March 17, 1894, p. 175-176 has more
  information on the rotary engine.
