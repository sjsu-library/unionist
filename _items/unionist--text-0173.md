transcription: REV. E. K. AVERY.—A statement having gone the rounds in certain public
  journals,<br>that the Rev. E. Avery has been suspended from the gospel ministry
  by the<br>Conference of the Methodist E. Church, and having been questioned on this<br>subject
  from various directions, we would say for the information of all<br>concerned, that
  there is no truth in the statement. He is not silenced by the<br>Methodist Conference,
  nor have any legal ecclesiastical proceedings been had on<br>his case in reference
  to such a subject; nor has there been any occasion for<br>such an examination that
  we can learn. Our only object is to contradict the<br>false statement above mentioned.—<br><em>Zion’s
  Herald.</em>
