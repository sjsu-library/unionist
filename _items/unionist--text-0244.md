scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: 'There are numerous details of interest in this "telegraphed" report.
  None is more important than the notice of the death of Lord Grenville (1759-1834).
  <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6433573.stm">Grenville was the Prime
  Minister</a> when Great Britain outlawed slavery, and his role in lobbying in favor
  of the bill was acknowledged by Wilberforce. '
