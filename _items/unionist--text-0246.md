    The Southern papers, received last evening, furnished us with the following.—

  <p align="center">DEPOSITES SENT BACK.</p>
  <p>
    “The Lousisvile [sic] Bank, a Noble example.—Our opinions as to the duty of
    the banks, designated as the depositories of the public funds, are known to
    the community. The Bank of Louisville, which was selected some months ago as
    an agent of the treasury, has, we rejoice to announce, taken the course
    prescribed by wisdom and justice. Her board of directors, we are authorized to
    say, have adopted resolutions revoking their contract with the government, and
    the Secretary of the Treasury that the revenue already paid into the
    institution under their charge is subject to the Treasurer’s order. Like the
    directors of the Bank of Charleston and of the Bank of Virginia; they have had
    the moral courage to do justice to themselves worthy of the exalted estimation
    in which they are held by an intelligent public.”

scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: 'Kentucky''s formal banking system was still in its infancy when the Jacksonian
  Banking crisis, and the great financial disaster of 1837 happened. There is a scholarly
  article on this subject: William C. Mallalieu and Sabri M. Akural, "Kentucky Banks
  in the Crisis Decade: 1834-1844, <em>The Register of the Kentucky Historical Society</em>
  65:4 (October 1967): 294-303.'
