transcription: <p align="center"><em>From the New York Daily Adv.</em></p><p>  The
  Southern papers, received last evening, furnished us with the following.— <br></p><p
  align="center">DEPOSITES SENT BACK.</p><p>  “The Lousisvile [sic] Bank, a Noble
  example.—Our opinions as to the duty of <br>  the banks, designated as the depositories
  of the public funds, are known to <br>  the community. The Bank of Louisville, which
  was selected some months ago as <br>  an agent of the treasury, has, we rejoice
  to announce, taken the course <br>  prescribed by wisdom and justice. Her board
  of directors, we are authorized to <br>  say, have adopted resolutions revoking
  their contract with the government, and <br>  the Secretary of the Treasury that
  the revenue already paid into the <br>  institution under their charge is subject
  to the Treasurer’s order. Like the <br>  directors of the Bank of Charleston and
  of the Bank of Virginia; they have had <br>  the moral courage to do justice to
  themselves worthy of the exalted estimation <br>  in which they are held by an intelligent
  public.” <br></p><p></p>
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: 'Kentucky''s formal banking system was still in its infancy when the Jacksonian
  Banking crisis, and the great financial disaster of 1837 happened. There is a scholarly
  article on this subject: William C. Mallalieu and Sabri M. Akural, "Kentucky Banks
  in the Crisis Decade: 1834-1844, <em>The Reigster of the Kentucky Historical Society</em>
  65:4 (October 1967): 294-303.'
