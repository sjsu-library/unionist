  says – “we learn by a gentlemen,<br>that, on Monday last Mr. John R. Scott of Jessamine
  county, was shot through the<br>head with a pistol, and expired in a few hours afterwards.
  The circumstances<br>have not been fully related to us, but it appears that a recontre
  had taken<br>place, or was about to take place, between two individuals, January
  and Reese,<br>and that the deceased interfered to put a stop to it, when he was<br>unintentionally
  shot by Reese, who perhaps intended to shoot his antagonist,<br>January. The deceased
  was highly respectable.”<br>"
