  \ By T.K. HERVEY<br></p><p>Morn on the waters! and purple and bright</p><p>Bursts
  on the billows the flashing of light;</p><p>O’er the glad waves, like a child of
  the sun,</p><p>See the tall vessel goes gallantly on;</p><p>Full to the breeze she
  unbosoms her sail—</p><p>And her pennons stream onward, like Hope, in the gale;</p><p>The
  waves come around her in murmur and song—</p><p>And the surges rejoice as they bear
  her along;</p><p>See! she looks up to the golden-edged clouds,</p><p>And the sailor
  sings gaily aloft in her shrouds;</p><p>Onward she glides amid ripple and spray,</p><p>Over
  the waters, away and away—</p><p>Bright as the visions of youth ere they part,</p><p>Passing
  away like a dream of the heart;</p><p>Who, as the beautiful pageant sweeps by—</p><p>Music
  around her and sunshine on high—</p><p>Pauses to think amid glitter and glow,</p><p>O!
  there be hearts that are breaking below!</p><p>Night on the waves! And the moon
  is on high,</p><p>Hung like a gem on the brow of the sky—</p><p>Treading its depths
  in the power of her might,</p><p>And turning the clouds, as they pass her, to light!</p><p>Look
  to the waters! asleep on their breast,</p><p>Seems not the ship like an island of
  rest,</p><p>Bright and alone on the shadowy main—</p><p>Like a heart-cherished home
  on some desolate plain?</p><p>Who,—as she smiles in the silvery light,</p><p>Spreading
  her wings to the bosom of night,</p><p>Alone on the deep as the moon in the sky—</p><p>A
  phantom of beauty!—could deem with a sigh,</p><p>That so lovely a thing is the mansion
  of sin,</p><p>And souls that are smitten lie bursting within?</p><p>Who, as he watches
  her silently gliding,</p><p>Remembers that wave after wave is dividing</p><p>Bosoms
  that sorrow and guilt could not sever,</p><p>Hearts that are parted and broken forever?</p><p>Or
  deems that he watches afloat on the wave,</p><p>The death-bed of hope, or the young
  spirit’s grave!</p><p>‘Tis thus with our life as it passes along;</p><p>Like a vessel
  at sea, amid sunshine and song,</p><p>Gaily we glide in the gaze of the world,</p><p>With
  streamers afloat, and with canvass unfurled—</p><p>All gladness and glory to wondering
  eyes,</p><p>Yet charted with sorrow and freighted with sighs;</p><p>Fading and false
  is the aspect it wears,</p><p>As the smiles we put on just to cover out tears—</p><p>And
  the withering thoughts which the world cannot know.</p><p>Like heart-broken exiles,
  lie burning below—</p><p>Whilst the vessel drives on to that desolate shore,</p><p>Where
  the dreams of our childhood are vanished and o’er.</p>"

  the significant Anti-Slavery Society at the same time that the Canterbury Female

  of July 19, 1833. Hervey made a motion to endorse the Canterbury Female Academy,
  which was passed unanimously. He attended the 1834 meeting of the New-England Anti-Slavery
  Society. He moved to Pennsylvania where he started a school, married, and had three
  daughters before his death from tuberculosis. Materials in the Amherst College Archives. '
