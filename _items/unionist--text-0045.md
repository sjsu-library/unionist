transcription: "“The Blue Laws of Connecticut have become Black. We learn from the
  Norwich <br>Courier, that Miss Prudence Crandall was arrested on Thursday for the
  heinous <br>offence, in the eye of the Connecticut law-givers, of instructing a
  few colored <br>girls not belonging to the State. Not obtaining bonds, she was committed
  to <br>jail.”— <br><em>Worcester Yeoman.</em>"
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: The Blue Laws were restrictions to activity on the Sabbath. Lists of the
  Connecticut Blue Laws were often exaggerated or outright invented. However, as a
  youngster growing up in Connecticut in the 1970s, an echo of them still existed
  in the ban on liquor sales on Sundays!
