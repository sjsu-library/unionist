transcription: The “Unionist,” (so mis-called,) has expired, and in its stead [sic]
  we have<br>received from Brooklyn a very near and well conducted paper bearing the
  title of<br>the “Windham County Whig and Unionist,” published by Mr. C. M. Halle.
  We trust<br>the Whig will speak the sentiments and receive the patronage of the
  intelligent<br>yeomanry of that County.<br>
scholarlyNotes: I feel this is incorrect, as Garrison and others make reference to
  issues of <em>The Unionist</em> much later than this.
commentary: I feel this is incorrect, as Garrison and others make reference to issues
  of <em>The Unionist</em> much later than this.
