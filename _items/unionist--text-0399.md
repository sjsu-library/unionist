transcription: 'The “Unionist,” (so mis-called,) has expired, and in its stead [sic]
  we have received from Brooklyn a very neat and well conducted paper bearing the
  title of the “Windham County Whig and Unionist,” published by Mr. C. M. Halle. We
  trust the Whig will speak the sentiments and receive the patronage of the intelligent
  yeomanry of that County. '
scholarlyNotes: I feel this is incorrect, as Garrison and others make reference to
  issues of <em>The Unionist</em> much later than this.
commentary: I feel this is incorrect, as Garrison and others make reference to issues
  of <em>The Unionist</em> much later than this.
