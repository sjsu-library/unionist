transcription: We have received the first number of a new paper published at Brooklyn
  in this state called <em>“the Unionist.”</em> It proposes to be an <em>independent
  </em>paper, which means absolute <em>dependence</em> on two or three individuals—it
  is a <em>one-party</em> paper which is to be understood as opposing the democratic
  party—and <em>unionist</em> signifies disunion, discord and dissension, provided
  it is in the powr of two or three persons of long purses, negro friendship and church
  and State view to create them. The Advertiser which is printed at Brooklyn is conducted
  with far more ability than any paper which ever preceded it in that county, and
  is more expressive of the feelings and sentiments of the citizens. We doubt whether
  Tappan &amp; Co. will be able to control the people of Windham county, or whether
  it is in this power to enlighten them. They best know their own interest, and the
  <em>Unionist</em> will not <em>unite</em> them in favor of the negro school.
scholarlyNotes: This article reprinted in <em>Eastern Argus</em> 9 Aug 1833, with
  the title “Another Snake in the Grass” and credits the <em>Hartford Times</em> rather
  than the <em>Windham Times</em>
commentary: The Windham Times, aligned with the pro-colonizationist and Jacksonian
  forces, is unimpressed with The Unionist
