  Witter of <br>  Brooklyn in the County of Windham, and his associates will prefer
  a petition <br>  to the Hon. General Assembly of the State of Connecticut to be
  convened at New <br>  Haven on the first Wednesday in May next, praying said Assembly
  to appoint a <br>  Committee to lay out a Turnpike road, beginning near the Post
  Office in <br>  Willimantic in the town of Windham, thence in the most direct and
  convenient <br>  way to the gap or notch in Bolton mountain (so called) intersecting
  the Boston <br>  Turnpike road near said notch in said mountain, and make return
  of their <br>  doings to said Assembly. And also praying said Assembly to incorporate
  said <br>  Witter and his associates into a Turnpike Company for the purpose of
  making <br>  and keeping said proposed road in repair as by said petition will appear.
  All <br>  persons concerned are notified to appear before said Assembly as the law
  <br>  directs, then and there to show reasons if any they have why the prayer of
  <br>  said petition should not be granted. <br></p><p>  Dated at Brooklyn the 12<sup>th</sup>
