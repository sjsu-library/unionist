  Witter of Brooklyn in the County of Windham, and his associates will prefer a petition
  to the Hon. General Assembly of the State of Connecticut to be convened at New Haven
  on the first Wednesday in May next, praying said Assembly to appoint a Committee
  to lay out a Turnpike road, beginning near the Post Office in Willimantic in the
  town of Windham, thence in the most direct and convenient way to the gap or notch
  in Bolton mountain (so called) intersecting the Boston Turnpike road near said notch
  in said mountain, and make return of their doings to said Assembly. And also praying
  said Assembly to incorporate said Witter and his associates into a Turnpike Company
  for the purpose of making and keeping said proposed road in repair as by said petition
  will appear. All persons concerned are notified to appear before said Assembly as
  the law directs, then and there to show reasons if any they have why the prayer
  of said petition should not be granted. </p> <p> Dated at Brooklyn the 12 <sup>th</sup>
  day of March 1834. </p> <p></p> "
