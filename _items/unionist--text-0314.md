transcription: "<p>   WESTMINSTER, April 8   <sup>th</sup>   , 1834 </p> <p>   Mr.
  Editor, “How are the mighty fallen!” Jacksonism and Judsonism, recently so   flourishing
  in Canterbury have met a sad and total overthrow. All the efforts   of our gallant
  Col. to ride into office on the storm of an anti-negro   excitement have utterly
  failed, and discomfited and chagrined, the Col.   declares, as I am told, that the
  Canterbury people may take care of the black   school for themselves—he fights against
  it no longer. Alas for us! Who shall   now head our opposition against that nuisance,
  that abomination in our eyes!   Verily, if the Col. deserteth the post he has so
  bravely occupied the past   year, it will be to the opposers of the school “as when
  a standard bearer   fainteth.” But I intended to tell you something of the contest,
  which has   terminated in such a disastrous overthrow of the Col’s party here. At
  our   first trial for representative, we failed of making a choice, and Col. Judson
  \  had a plurality of two or three votes or so over Baldwin. The second trial   however
  showed the Col’s folks how the freemen when fairly waked up, could   “shed fast
  atonement for the first delay.” The Col. had the leave of about 60   majority of
  the electors, to enjoy the sweets of domestic felicity and of   neighborly intercourse
  with his kind friends on the green, uninterrupted by   the cares of office. </p>
  <p>   We now tried for our second representative, and I leave you to guess how the
  \  subjects of two Andrew’s twisted and turned to get their beloved in. Mr. Lyon
  \  of course could not expect to take the second chance if the Col himself lost
  \  the first so he stood back as in duty bound, for his superior officer, and the
  \  struggle was between Clarke and Judson. Now we Westminster chaps have an idea
  \  that Clarke is about as fit for any office in our gift as the Archbishop is,
  \  or ever was, and so we gave him to understand as much by our votes. We have no
  \  notion of supporting black laws or black law men, or Jacksonmen or Judsonmen.
  \  The Col’s efforts to buy up the Antimasons by an offer of a share in the   spoils
  of victory proved unavailing. Our Antimasonic neighbors think that   those who offer
  the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them, or any part   and parcel thereof,
  had better be sure they have them to give, before   <em>they</em>   fall down and
  worship, for such considerations, and then they won’t bow the   knee to   <em>such</em>
  \  a Baal as our Judsonian friends set up. Mr. Judson accordingly was again   notified
  by 70 majority, that we don’t want him to go to New-Haven on our   account this
  year. I presume he understands our meaning by this time, for if   he didn’t comprehend
  it at two intimations, he must have begun to guess what   it was by the time we
  had given about a hundred majority against his   candidates for Senator, Governor
  &amp;c. </p> <p>OLD WESTMINSTER</p> <p></p> "
