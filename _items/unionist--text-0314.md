transcription: "<p>  WESTMINSTER, April 8<br>  <sup>th</sup>  , 1834<br></p><p>  Mr.
  Editor, “How are the mighty fallen!” Jacksonism and Judsonism, recently so<br>  flourishing
  in Canterbury have met a sad and total overthrow. All the efforts<br>  of our gallant
  Col. to ride into office on the storm of an anti-negro<br>  excitement have utterly
  failed, and discomfited and chagrined, the Col.<br>  declares, as I am told, that
  the Canterbury people may take care of the black<br>  school for themselves—he fights
  against it no longer. Alas for us! Who shall<br>  now head our opposition against
  that nuisance, that abomination in our eyes!<br>  Verily, if the Col. deserteth
  the post he has so bravely occupied the past<br>  year, it will be to the opposers
  of the school “as when a standard bearer<br>  fainteth.” But I intended to tell
  you something of the contest, which has<br>  terminated in such a disastrous overthrow
  of the Col’s party here. At our<br>  first trial for representative, we failed of
  making a choice, and Col. Judson<br>  had a plurality of two or three votes or so
  over Baldwin. The second trial<br>  however shoed the Col’s folks how the freemen
  when fairly waked up, could<br>  “shed fast atonement for the first delay.” The
  Col. had the leave of about 60<br>  majority of the electors, to enjoy the sweets
  of domestic felicity and of<br>  neighborly intercourse with his kind friends on
  the green, uninterrupted by<br>  the cares of office.<br></p><p>  We now tried for
  our second representative, and I leave you to guess how the<br>  subjects of two
  Andrew’s twisted and turned to get their beloved in. Mr. Lyon<br>  of course could
  not expect to take the second chance if the Col himself lost<br>  the first so he
  stood back as in duty bound, for his superior officer, and the<br>  struggle was
  between Clarke and Judson. Now we Westminster chaps have an idea<br>  that Clarke
  is about as fit for any office in our gift as the Archbishop is,<br>  or ever was,
  and so we gave him to understand as much by our votes. We have no<br>  notion of
  supporting black laws or black law men, or Jacksonmen or Judsonmen.<br>  The Col’s
  efforts to buy up the Antimasons by an offer of a share in the<br>  spoils of victory
  proved unavailing. Our Antimasionic neighbors think that<br>  those who offer the
  kingdoms of the world and the glory of them, or any part<br>  and parcel thereof,
  had better be sure they have them to give, before<br>  <em>they</em>  fall down
  and worship, for such considerations, and then they won’t bow the<br>  knee to<br>
  \ <em>such</em>  a Baal as our Judsonian friends set up. Mr. Judson accordingly
  was again<br>  notified by 70 majority, that we don’t want him to go to New-Haven
  on our<br>  account this year. I presume he understands our meaning by this time,
  for if<br>  he didn’t comprehend it at two intimations, he must have begun to guess
  what<br>  it was by the time we had given about a hundred majority against his<br>
  \ candidates for Senator, Governor &amp;c.<br></p><p>OLD WESTMINSTER</p><p></p>"
