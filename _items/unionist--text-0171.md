  9. </p> <p> The President pro tem. presented the credentials of the Hon. Wm. C.
  Preston elected a Senator from the State of S. Carolina, to supply the vacancy occasioned
  by the resignation of the Hon. Stephen D. Miller. </p> <p> Also the credentials
  of the Hon. Samuel McKean, elected a Senator from the State of Pennsylvania, in
  the place of the Hon. George M. Dallas, whose term of service had expired. </p>
  <p> He also informed the Senate of the Receipt of the credentials of the Hon. Daniel
  Webster, re-elected a Senator from the State of Massachusetts. —Mr. Frelinghuysen
  presented the credentials of the Hon. Samuel L. Southard, elected a Senator from
  N. Jersey; in the place of the Hon. Mahlon Dickerson, whose term of service had
  expired.—Whereupon Messrs. Webster, Southard, and Preston appeared, were qualified,
  and took their seats.—On motion of Mr. Poindexter, the credentials of the election
  of the Hon. Mr Robins, were deferred to the special committee appointed on that
  subject.—On motion of Mr Grundy, the Senate proceeded to the election of a Secretary,
  when it appeared that Walter Lowrie was unanimously elected, he having received
  39 votes.—John Shackford, having received a majority of votes was duly elected Seargent-at-Arms
  and Doorkeeper. </p> <p> The Senate then proceeded to the election of an Assistant
  Doorkeeper, when it appeared that Stephen Haight was elected on the 6 <sup>th</sup>
  ballot. </p> <p> Mr. Clay moved the postponement of the choice of Chaplain, which
  on motion of Mr Chambers, of Maryland, was appointed to take place to-morrow. </p>
  <p> Mr. Benton proposed a resolution calling for information from the Secretary
  of the Treasury relative to the amount of public money deposited in the United States
  Bank. </p> <p> Mr. Clay moved that the resolution be laid on the table; not that
  he had any objection to the resolution itself, but he wished that the country should
  have an opportunity of ascertaining the condition of other Banks as well as that
  of the United States. </p> <p>The resolution was laid on the table.</p> <p> Mr Calhoun,
  on leave, presented a bill to repeal the act of last session, providing for the
  collection of duties on imports; which passed to a second reading. </p> <p> Mr.
  Benton, pursuant to notice and on leave given presented a bill granting to the State
  of Missouri a certain quantity of land for purposes of internal improvement, &amp;c;
  which was read a first time and passed to a second reading. </p> <p> Also, a joint
  resolution relative to an alteration of the Constitution of the United States, in
  relation to the President and Vice President of the United States—which, on motion
  of Mr. Bibb, was laid on the table and ordered to be printed. </p> <p> Also, a bill
  to graduate the prices of the public lands longest in market; which was passed to
  a second reading. </p> <p> Mr Webster gave notice that he would on to-morrow, introduce
  a bill to provide for compensating certain citizens of the United [States] for French
  spoliations upon their commerce. </p> <p align="center">HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES</p>
  <p>Monday, December 9, 1833.</p> <p>Messrs. Wise and Plummer appeared, were qualified,
  and took their seats.</p> <p>Several Standing Committees were then announced from
  the Chair.</p> <p> The Speaker announced that on Wednesday next, the several States
  would be called in their order for presentation of petitions. </p> <p>Mr. Patton
  submitted the following:</p> <p> Resolved—That the following shall be established
  as the 9 <sup>th</sup> rule of this House: </p> <p> “In all cases the Speaker shall
  vote, and if the House be equally divided, the question shall be lost.” </p> <p>The
  further consideration of the motion was postponed till Monday next.</p> <p> The
  Speaker laid before the House two Messages from the President, which were appropriately
  referred. </p> <p align="center">IN SENATE</p> <p align="right">TUESDAY, December
  10, 1833.</p> <p> Mr Webster presented a petition from citizens of the City of Cincinnati,
  praying Congress to purchase all private interests in the Louisville and Portland
  Canal; which was laid on the table and ordered to be printed. </p> <p> Mr Clay said
  that the bill contained no material alteration from that of last session, and on
  his motion, the bill was read the first time by its title. </p> <p> Mr Clay moved
  to take up for consideration the resolution submitted by Mr Benton in relation to
  the amount of moneys deposited in the Bank of the United States; which was agreed
  to. </p> <p> Mr Clay offered an amendment, as an additional resolution; which was
  read and agreed to. </p> <p> Mr Clay submitted the following resolution; which was
  read and laid on the table: </p> <p> Resolved, That the President of the United
  States be requested to inform the Senate whether a paper under date the ______day
  of September, 1833, purporting to have been read by him to the Heads of the Several
  Departments, relating to the deposites [sic] of the public money in the Treasury
  of the United States, and alledged [sic] to have been published by his authority,
  be genuine that he be also requested to lay a copy of said paper before the Senate.
  </p> <p> Mr Webster, on leave given, presented a bill to provide satisfaction for
  the claims of citizens of the United States for French spoliations; which passed
  to a second reading. </p> <p> The Senate then proceeded to the election of a Chaplain,
  which resulted in the choice of the Rev. Mr Hatch, on the 6 <sup>th</sup> ballot.
  </p> <p> The Senate then proceeded to the order of the day, and resumed the consideration
  of Mr Sprague’s resolution to alter the mode of electing their Standing Committees
  by the Senate, instead of being as formerly appointed by the President <em>pro tem.</em>
  </p> <p align="center">HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES</p> <p align="right">TUESDAY, December
  10.</p> <p> On motion of Mr McDuffie, the Report of the Secretary on the removal
  of the deposites [sic], was taken up and referred to the Committee of the Whole
  on the state of the Union. </p> <p> Mr Pinckney, of South Carolina, rose and stated
  that he held in his hand certain resolutions which he would respectfully ask leave
  to offer for adoption by the House. He believed that it had always been customary
  for the House to adopt suitable tributes of respect to its deceased members. The
  S.C. delegation had heard, with deep regret, of the death of their colleague, the
  Hon. Thomas D. Singleton, and it was his painful duty to communicate that mournful
  information to the House. He died at Raleigh, whilst on his journey to the Capitol,
  whither he was hastening to assume his seat, and to discharge his duties, as a member
  of this body. **** </p> <p> With these few remarks, which he had felt it his duty
  to submit, in justice to the character of one whose memory deserved a far better
  tribute than any he could offer, he now proposed the following resolutions for the
  consideration of the House; </p> <p> Resolved, That we have received, with deep
  regret, the melancholy intelligence of the death of the Hon. THO’S D. SINGLETON,
  a Representative elect from the State of South Carolina. </p> <p> Resolved, That
  this House tender the expression of their sympathy to the relatives of the deceased,
  upon this mournful event; and that, in testimony of their regret for the loss, and
  respect for his memory, the members will wear crape upon the left arm for thirty
  days. </p> <p>The House then adjourned.</p> <p>IN SENATE</p> <p>THURSDAY, December
  12.</p> <p> A Message from the President was received by the hands of Mr Donalson,
  his Private Secretary, which was read as follows: </p> <p> I have attentively considered
  the resolution of the Senate of the 11th instant, requesting the President of the
  United States to communicate to the Senate "a copy of the paper which has been published,
  and which purports to have been read by him to the heads of the Executive Departments,
  dated the 18th day of September last, relating to the removal of the deposits of
  the public money from the Bank of the United States and its offices." <br /> The
  executive is a co-ordinate and independent branch of the Government equally with
  the Senate, and I have yet to learn under what constitutional authority that branch
  of the Legislature has a right to require of me an account of any communication,
  either verbally or in writing, made to the heads of Departments acting as a Cabinet
  council. As well might I be required to detail to the Senate the free and private
  conversations I have held with those officers on any subject relating to their duties
  and my own. <br /> Feeling my responsibility to the American people, I am willing
  upon all occasions to explain to them the grounds of my conduct, and I am willing
  upon all proper occasions to give to either branch of the Legislature any information
  in my possession that can be useful in the execution of the appropriate duties confided
  to them. <br /> Knowing the constitutional rights of the Senate, I shall be the
  last man under any circumstances to interfere with them. Knowing those of the Executive,
  I shall at all times endeavor to maintain them agreeably to the provisions of the
  Constitution and the solemn oath I have taken to support and defend it. <br /> I
  am constrained, therefore, by a proper sense of my own self-respect and of the rights
  secured by the Constitution to the executive branch of the Government to decline
  a compliance with your request. ANDREW JACKSON </p> <p>After the message had been
  read,</p> <p> Mr Clay said, that a call had been made on the President for a copy
  of a document which has been published and extensively circulated by the papers
  in this city—a document intimately connected with the safety of the treasure of
  the country. The call for it was made under the full conviction that the Senate
  ought to have that document. It had been refused, under the pretext that the rights
  of the Chief Magistrate were invaded by it. He always would be disposed to respect
  the rights of every public officer, but the President could have no more confidence
  in his rights, then I feel in the rights of the Senate. The right of the Senate
  to call for this paper was founded on the ground that the whole world was already
  in possession of it. It was made because the document was sent forth to the American
  people upon an all-important subject, and because it was the right of the Senate
  to have it. Nor was it made because the call was in violation of precedent or an
  established usage. But the President has refused to give us this document, and it
  was not necessary to proceed further in the pursuit. One result happens from it.
  The President don’t deny the genuineness of the paper. It is before the world, and
  as we have endeavored to get it, and it has been refused, I have a right to take
  the next best evidence of the document, and that is as it has been published in
  the official paper. In every instance, therefore, where I have occasion to use it,
  I shall avail myself of that publication of it, as genuine. </p> <p> Mr Grundy said
  he thought when the proposition was made, that it was a very unnecessary procedure.
  </p> <p> Here the presiding office interposed that the debate was out of order unless
  some motion was intended to be made. </p> <p> Mr Grundy said he intended to move,
  before he concluded, that the message be laid on the table; and then resumed— </p>
  <p> That he thought it unnecessary, because we only wanted evidence when facts had
  not come to our knowledge, or when they are denied.—Now, he believed that both friends
  and enemies admitted this document to be genuine—to be what it purported to be.
  He therefore had thought that nothing beneficial could result from this proposition,
  and this was what induced him to vote against it. The President has given his objection
  to complying with the call, and what is it? Why, that the Senate has asked for a
  private communication from the Chief Magistrate to his Cabinet. He, [Mr. G.] would
  never question the propriety of the motives of the Senator who wanted this information.
  But the President has. </p> <p align="center">IN SENATE.</p> <p align="right">WEDNESDAY,
  December 11, 1833.</p> <p> Mr Bibb, pursuant to notice given, presented certain
  joint resolutions providing or an alteration in the Constitution of the United States,
  in relation to the mode of electing the President, and Vice President, and then
  moved to lay the same on the table and print them. Mr. B. said he felt no disposition
  to press the consideration of the resolutions now, and therefore moved that the
  second Monday in January next be assigned for taking them up, and also the resolutions
  offered by Mr. Benton somedays since, on the same subject, at the same time; which
  was agreed to. </p> <p> Mr Clay moved the consideration of Mr Benton’s resolution,
  relative to the amount of moneys in deposite [sic] at particular periods in the
  Bank of the United States. </p> <p><em>Apparently a line is missing here</em></p>
  <p> Said that it is a matter which you have no right to interrogate him about; and
  his opinion is, too, that to comply with the request would be setting a dangerous
  precedent. He [Mr G.] was not inclined to sat any thing on the subject of the removal
  of the deposits, when that matter should come up for consideration. But if he did,
  he could not, even if he were so disposed, speak of that paper as any other than
  a genuine one, or deny its authenticity. He therefore moved to key the message on
  the table; which was agreed to. </p> <p align="center">HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</p>
  <p align="right">Friday, Dec, 13, 1833</p> <p> The Speaker presented to the House
  a memorial from Messrs. Gilpin, McElderry, and Wager, the three Government Directors
  of the Bank of the United State, in relation to the conduct of the Directors, and
  especially of the President of that institution. </p> '
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: This includes Jackson’s rather petulant assertion of executive privilege
  to not talk to the Senate! It is also worth noting that Clay was a former nominee
  for the office of the President. These manouvers are classic politicking.
