transcription: "<p>From the Brooklyn Unionist, October 10</p><p>MISS CRANDALL’S SECOND
  TRIAL.</p><p>  Last Thursday Miss Crandall was brought before the Superior Court
  sitting in<br>  this place, (Judge Daggett on the bench,) upon an information similar
  to that<br>  on which she was tried at the last session of the County Court. She
  had been<br>  bound over to answer to two complaints, one for teaching, and the
  other for<br>  boarding colored persons from other states., but was tried on the
  former only.<br>  A.T. Judson, Esq. and C.F. Cleaveland, the State’s Attorney, conducted
  the<br>  prosecution, Henry Strong, Esq. and Hon. Calvin Goddard the defence. The
  plea<br>  as on the former trial was<br>  <em>not guilty.</em>  Several witnesses
  were examined, the facts necessary to conviction were<br>  proved, and nothing remained
  but to establish the constitutionality of the<br>  law.<br></p><p>  Mr. Judson opened
  the case for the prosecution and pursued much the same train<br>  of argument as
  on the former trial, except that in addition to the points then<br>  made, he contended
  that the clause in the constitution which was made the<br>  ground of the defence,
  was intended as a rule of action to the general<br>  government only, and not to
  the State Legislatures. He was followed by Mr.<br>  Strong, who, in a powerful,
  logical and conclusive argument, clearly exhibited<br>  the unconstitutionality
  of the law, showing that the Constitution<br>  <em>was</em>  made to control the
  action of the state Legislatures; that it was intended to<br>  secure to all citizens
  of the United States, the enjoyment of such privileges<br>  and immunities as are
  fundamental; that the privilege of obtaining an<br>  education is fundamental; and
  that free blacks are citizens, and of course<br>  entitled, though citizens of other
  states, to the same privileges as our own<br>  colored population, and among others
  to that of acquiring knowledge here. Mr.<br>  Goddard closed for the defence, briefly
  but eloquently, and the State’s<br>  Attorney having concluded on the part of the
  prosecution, the judge rose and<br>  saying a few words respecting the importance
  of the question, and his<br>  inability to do it justice, declined giving his charge
  till the next morning.<br></p><p>  On Friday morning as soon as the court was opened
  every seat was occupied and<br>  many persons stood unable to obtain seats, all
  listening with profound<br>  attention to the charge. It occupied as nearly as we
  could estimate, about an<br>  hour, and as will be seen by the outline given below
  was decidedly in favor of<br>  the constitutionality of the law.<br></p><p>  After
  stating to the Jury the charge on which Miss Crandall was brought before<br>  them,
  His Honor Judge Daggett proceeded: “In relation to the facts there does<br>  not
  appear to be much controversy—it is your province however to decide<br>  whether
  they have been proved. It is also your province to decide as to the<br>  law, the
  court cannot direct you as to either. But it is the duty of the court<br>  to advise
  you in respect to the law.<br></p><p>  It is claimed that the law under which this
  prosecution is instituted, is<br>  unconstitutional.&nbsp; If it be, it is because
  it violates the constitution<br>  of the United States, for it is not violation
  of the constitution of<br>  Connecticut. The question then is, Does this law violate
  the constitution of<br>  the United States? If a law is clearly unconstitutional,
  it is the duty of the<br>  humblest court in the land, even a justice of the peace,
  so to pronounce it,<br>  for all judges, under which name are included jurors when
  acting as judges,<br>  are bound by the constitution or laws in the respective states
  to the contrary<br>  notwithstanding.<br></p><p>  In considering the question, “Is
  this law unconstitutional,” you will lay out<br>  of consideration all extrinsic
  matter, slavery, and all its enormous evils;<br>  the degradation of the blacks,
  and the utility and necessity of their being<br>  educated, except so far as it
  is necessary to determine whether the privilege<br>  of education is fundamental,
  of which I have no doubt.<br></p><p>There are two points to be considered.</p><p>
  \ 1<br>  <sup>st</sup>  . The constitution secures to all citizens of the U.S. the
  privileges and<br>  immunities of citizens in the several states. The construction
  of this section<br>  <em>is not,</em>  as was contended at the bar, that it regulates
  only the action of the general<br>  Government: it is operative as well upon the
  state Legislature as upon<br>  Congress.<br></p><p>  2<br>  <sup>nd</sup>  . Are
  the persons affected by this law, citizens of the United States. The law<br>  prohibits
  colored persons from Havana coming here, as well as the blacks of<br>  other states.
  With respect to the former, the right of exclusion is<br>  unquestionable, for they
  are not citizens of the United States. Are the<br>  colored inhabitants of this
  country citizens? It is the opinion of this court<br>  that they are not. Are slaves
  citizens of the United States? The constitution<br>  recognizes them only as the
  basis of representation and taxation. I refer to<br>  the definition of the word
  citizen as given by Mr. Webster, the ablest<br>  philologist of this or any country.
  (The judge here read the several<br>  definitions of the word as given in Webster’s
  dictionary, the last of which,<br>  and the only one applicable to the case is as
  follows—“In the United States, a<br>  person, native or naturalized, who has the
  privilege of exercising the<br>  elective franchise, and of purchasing and holding
  real estate.”) Slaves, then,<br>  are not citizens, in any of the state constitutions.
  Are Indians citizens? It<br>  is difficult to say what they are, but they are not
  citizens. Kent, in his<br>  commentaries, speaks of them as distinct tribes, living
  under the protection<br>  of the government,—2 Kent, 70. Are the free people of
  color citizens? I<br>  answer, No. They are not so styled in the Constitution of
  the United States,<br>  or, so far as I am aware, in the laws of Congress or of
  any of the states. In<br>  that clause of the constitution which fixes the basis
  of representation, there<br>  was an opportunity to have called them citizens if
  they were so considered.<br>  But that makes free<br>  <em>persons</em>  (adding
  three fifths of all other persons,) the basis of representation and<br>  taxation..<br></p><p>
  \ It has been said that free blacks own vessels which participate in the<br>  peculiar
  privileges of American shipping. But this claim has never been<br>  settled by judicial
  decisions. I know of no case where this question has been<br>  settled. It is said
  also that blacks may sue in the U.S. Courts, but this too,<br>  has never, within
  my knowledge been decided. It is claimed that they are<br>  citizens because they
  may be guilty of treason, but so may any person who<br>  resides under the government
  and enjoys its protection, if he rises up against<br>  it.<br></p><p>  [His honor
  then read from Kent’s commentaries II, 210 a note in which the<br>  commentator
  speaks of the degraded condition of the blacks and the<br>  disabilities under which
  they labor, and thence inferred that in Kent’s<br>  opinion they were not citizens.]<br></p><p>
  \ Another reason for believing that people of color were not considered<br>  citizens,
  is found in the fact that when the United States Constitution was<br>  adopted every
  state except Massachusetts, tolerated slavery. The slave laws of<br>  New-York were
  as severe as those of any state in the Union. In 1740 a slave in<br>  that state
  was convicted by three justices and jury of five, and burnt at the<br>  stake. God
  forbid that I should add to the degradation of this people, by<br>  stating these
  things, but such is our condition.<br></p><p>  But if free blacks are citizens I
  am not prepared to say that the law is<br>  <em>unconstitutional,</em>  though on
  this point I have more doubts than on the other. The constitution of<br>  the United
  States did not profess to vest in the State Legislatures any new<br>  powers, but
  to abridge those already possessed. I see not but the Legislature,<br>  under their
  general power, might pass this law, I say nothing of its justice<br>  or injustice,
  for I do not stand here to justify or abuse the legislature<br>  which passed it.
  If the people disapprove the law, let them choose better men<br>  to represent them
  who will repeal it. The privilege of acquiring an education<br>  is certainly a
  fundamental privilege, but I am of opinion that the Legislature<br>  may regulate
  it.<br></p><p>  The jury went out, and after an absence of 20 or 30 minutes returned
  with a<br>  verdict of GUILTY.<br></p><p>  A bill of exceptions was filed by the
  defendant’s council, and the case will<br>  be carried to the Supreme Court of Errors,
  which will sit here next July.”<br></p>"
