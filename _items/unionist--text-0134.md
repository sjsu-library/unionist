transcription: "<em>The Americans, by an American.</em>—“The Rev. Calvin Colton has
  written a book entitled ‘The Americans,’ in which<br>he gives a deserved castigation
  to Capt. Basil Hall, Mrs. Trollope, and the<br>English Reviewers. This work, which
  is said to be a very clever performance,<br>coming on the back of Mr. Stuart’s,
  will pretty well settle the question with<br>these traducers of American character
  and manners.<br>"
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: 'This book, <em>The Americans, by an American in London</em>, by Calvin
  Colton (1789-1857), can be found in a [Hathitrust digitization.] (https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=yale.39002007679153&view=1up&seq=7&q1=american%20colonization%20society)  It
  is unlikely that Burleigh had read it, as it contains support for the American Colonization
  Society, which he would not have endorsed.  In this 1833 book, Colton sees both
  the impracticality of the American Colonization Society''s project, and the evil
  of slavery, but still thinks that the Colonization Society is a benevolent organization
  that is gradually raising consciousness around the issue of slavery. When he returned
  to the United States in 1835, though, he became a strident anti-abolitionist, even
  writing a piece titled <em>Abolition, a Sedition</em> in 1839. For a full length
  scholarly article on Colton, see James D. Bratt, “From Revivalism to Anti-Revivalism
  to Whig Politics: The Strange Career of Calvin Colton.” <em>The Journal of Ecclesiastical
  History</em>, vol. 52, no. 1, 2001, pp. 63–82.'
