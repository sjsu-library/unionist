  prejudiced against color as to pronounce a black   complexion an evidence of Divine
  displeasure, you are requested to insert in   the “Unionist”&nbsp; the following
  extracts form a speech delivered in the   house of Delegates of Maryland at their
  session in November, 1789, by that   upright and enlightened statesman, William
  Pinkney, Esq. Let his sentiments be   contrasted with those to whom I have alluded.
  If as Archbishop Seeker has   asserted that “every death in battle is a murder,”
  the writer of this   introductory article verily believes that for the death of
  a Slave occasioned   by his servile condition the owner is responsible, and our
  country has   abundant and fearful reason to deprecate the solemn and awful denunciation   expressed
  in thsi (sic) sacred interrogatory—“Shall I not visit for these   things, saith
  the Lord? Shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as   this?” – HUMANITAS”
  </p> <p>   “Mr. Speaker, Iniquitous and most dishonorable to Maryland is that dreary   system
  of partial bondage, which her laws have hitherto supported with a   solicitude worthy
  of a better object, and Citizens by their practice   countenanced. Founded in a
  disgraceful traffic, to which the parent country   lent her fostering aid, from
  motives of interest, but which even she would   have disdained to encourage, had
  England been the destined mart of such   inhuman merchandize; its continuance is
  as shameful as its origin. </p> <p>   Eternal infamy await the abandoned miscreants
  whose selfish souls could ever   prompt them to rob unhappy Afric of her souls,
  and freight them hither by   thousands, to poison the fair Eden of liberty with
  the rank weed o individual   bondage. Nor is it more to the credit of our ancestors
  that they did not   command these savage spoilers to bear their hateful cargo to
  another shore,   where the shrine of freedom knew no votaries, and every purchaser
  would at   once be both a master and a slave. </p> <p>   In the dawn of time, Mr.
  Speaker, when the rough feelings of barbarism had not   experienced the softening
  touches of refinement, such an unprincipled   prostration of the inherent rights
  of human nature, would have needed the   gloss of an apology: but to the everlasting
  reproach of Maryland, be it said,   that when her citizens rivalled the nation from
  whence they emigrated, in the   knowledge of moral principles, and an enthusiasm
  in the cause of general   freedom, they stooped to become the purchasers of their
  fellow creatures, and   to introduce an hereditary bondage into the bosom of their
  country, which   should widen with every successive generation. </p> <p>   For my
  part, I would willingly draw the veil of oblivion over this disgusting   scene of
  iniquity, but that the present abject state of those who are   descended from these
  kidnapped sufferers, perpetually brings it forward to the   memory. </p> <p>   But
  wherefore should we confine the edge of censure to our ancestors, or those   from
  whom they purchased? Are not we equally guilty?   <em>They</em>   strewed around
  the seeds of slavery;   <em>we</em>   cherish and sustain the growth.—   <em>They</em>   introduced
  the system;   <em>we</em>   enlarge, invigorate, and conform it.—Yes, let it be
  handed down to posterity,   that the people of Maryland, who could fly to arms with
  the promptitude of   Roman citizens, when the hand of oppression was lifted up against   themselves—who
  could behold their country desolated, and their citizens   slaughtered, who could
  brave with unshaken firmness, every calamity of war,   before they would submit
  to the smallest infringement of their rights—that   this very people could yet see
  thousands of their fellow creatures, within the   limits of their territory, bending
  beneath an unnatural yoke; and instead of   being assiduous to destroy their shackles,
  anxious to immortalize their   duration, so that a nation of slaves might for ever
  exist in a country where   freedom is its boast. </p> <p>   “Even the very earth
  itself, (says some celebrated author) which teems with   profusion under the cultivating
  hand of the freeborn laborer, shrinks into   barrenness from the contaminating sweat
  of a slave.” This sentiment is not   more figuratively beautiful than substantially
  just. </p> <p>   Survey the countries, sir, where the hand of freedom conducts the
  ploughshare   and compare their produce with yours.—Your granaries in this view
  appear like   the store houses of emmets [a colloquial word for “ant”], though not
  supplied   with equal industry. To trace the cause of this disparity between the
  fruits   of a freeman’s voluntary labors, animated by the hope of profit, and the   slow-paced
  efforts of a slave, who acts only from compulsion, who has no   incitement to exertion
  but fear—no prospect of remuneration to encourage—would   be insulting the understanding.
  The cause and the effect are too obvious to   escape observation. </p> <p>   But
  it has been said (and who knows but the same opinion may still have its   advocates)
  “that nature has black balled these wretches out of society.”   Gracious God! can
  it be supposed that they Almighty Providence intended to   proscribe these victims
  of fraud and power, from the pale of society, because   thou hast denied them the
  delicacy of an European complexion? Is their color,   Mr. Speaker, the mark of Divine
  vengeance, or is it only the flimsy pretext   upon which we attempt to justify our
  treatment of them? Arrogant and   presumptuous is it this to make the dispensations
  of Providence subservient to   the purposes of iniquity, and every slight diversity
  in the works of nature   the apology for oppression. Thus acts the intemperate bigot
  in religion. He   persecutes every dissenter from his creed, in the name of God,
  and even rears   the horrid fabric of an inquisition upon heavenly foundations.
  </p> <p>   I like not these holy arguments. They are as convenient for the tyrant
  as the   patriot—the enemy as the friend of mankind. Contemplate this subject through   the
  calm medium of philosophy, and then to know that these shackled wretches   are men
  as well as we are, spring from the same common parent, and endued with   equal faculties
  of mind and body, is to know enough to make us disdain to torn   casuists on their
  complexion to the destruction of their rights. The beauty of   complexion is mere
  matter of taste, and varies indifferent countries, nay,   even in the same; and
  shall we dare to set up this vague, indeterminate,   weathercock standard, as the
  criterion by which shall be decided on what   complexions the rights of human nature
  are conferred, and to what they are   denied by the great ordinances of the Deity?
  As if the Ruler of the Universe   had made the darkness of a skin, the flatness
  of a nose, or the wideness of a   mouth, which are only deformities or beauties
  as the undulating tribunal of   taste shall determine the indication of his wrath.
  </p> <p>   Mr. Speaker, It is pitiable to reflect on the mistaken light in which
  this   unfortunate generation are viewed by the people in general. Hardly do they   deign
  to rank them in the order of beings above the mere animal that grazes   the field
  of its owner. That an humble, dusky, unlettered wretch that drags   the chain of
  bondage through the weary round of life, with no other privilege   but that of existing
  for another’s benefit should have been intended by heaven   for their equal they
  will not believe. But let me appeal to the intelligent   mind, and ask, in what
  respect they are our inferiors? Though they have never   been taught to tread the
  paths of science, or embellish human life by literary   acquirements; tho’ they
  cannot soar into the regions of taste and sentiment,   or explore the scenes of
  philosophical research, is it to be inferred that   they want the power, if the
  yoke of slavery did not check each aspiring effort   and clog the springs of action?
  Let the kind hand of an assiduous care mature   their powers, let the genius of
  freedom excite to manly thought and liberal   investigation, we should not then
  be found to monopolize the vigor of fancy,   the delicacy of taste, or the solidity
  of scientific endowments. Born with   hearts as susceptible of virtuous impressions
  as our own, and with minds as   capable of benefitting by improvement, they are
  in all respects our equals by   nature; and he who thinks otherwise has never reflected,
  that talents however   great may perish unnoticed and unknown, unless auspicious
  circumstances   conspire to draw them forth, and animate their exertions in the
  round of   knowledge. As well might you expect to see the bubbling fountain gush
  from the   burning sands of Arabia, as that the inspiration of genius or the enthusiastic   glow
  of sentiment should rouse the mind which has yielded its elasticity to   habitual
  subjection. Thus the ignorance and the vices of these wretches are   solely the
  result of situation, and therefore no evidence of their   inferiority. Like the
  flower whose culture has been neglected, and perishes   amidst permitted weeds ere
  it opens it blossom to the Spring, they only prove   the imbecility of human nature
  unassisted and oppressed. Well has Cowper said— </p> <p>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  ‘’Tis   liberty alone which gives the flower </p> <p>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Of fleeting   life its lustre and perfume, </p> <p>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  And we are   weeds without it.’ </p> '
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: William Pinkney (1764-1822) was an important statesman in the Early Republic.
  Hailing from Maryland, he served that state in Congress and, at the end of his life,
  in the Senate. He also performed ably as a diplomat and Attorney General. His reputation
  as an orator was strong. Pinkney's speech here, from early in his career, was in
  circulation among the Abolitionists; his fame and his writings were amplified in
  the 1820s at the time of his death.
