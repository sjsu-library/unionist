  sound and kind, good in harness or saddle, and that will stand without tying. Any

scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: James Whitcomb was a prominent white medical doctor, and a stalwart Abolitionist
  who played a part in the "calling" of Charles C. Burleigh to the editorship of <em>The
  Unionist</em>. History does not record if he obtained the desired horse.
