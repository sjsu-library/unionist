transcription: THE UNIONIST.—This is the title of a new paper just commenced at Brooklyn,
  Connecticut; edited and published by CHARLES C. BURLEIGH. We have received the first
  number, and are much pleased with its appearance. Pledged to no party, but taking
  for its motto the glorious truth—“Righteousness exalteth a nation!”—it avows its
  determination to exert its influence for the promotion of virtue and the suppression
  of vice. Upon the subject of A.T. Judson’s “black law,” it speaks fearlessly, independently,
  dispassionately. We wish the new paper success, and from our knowledge of the talents
  and stern moral integrity of its editor, we know it will deserve it.
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: The Schnectady Cabinet would prove to be a strong ally to the Abolitionist
  cause.
