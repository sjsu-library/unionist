  \ The information charged the defendant with having on the 28\n  <sup>th</sup>\n
  \ of January last, feloniously, voluntarily, maliciously, and wilfully, set fire\n
  \ to the dwelling-house of Miss Prudence Crandall, in Canterbury, in the County\n
  \ of Windham, and then and there, with force and arms, burning the same. The\n  information
  having been read, the defendant for plea, said that he was NOT\n  GUILTY.\n</p>\n<p>\n
  \ <em>Ebenezer Sangar</em>\n  was at the house of Miss Crandall the day of the fire—did
  not get there till\n  it was pretty much over. The house was wet, and people were
  at work about it,\n  cutting up the floors, &amp;c. While witness was in the house,
  Mr. Olney (the\n  defendant) came in and told Capt. Bacon, who was cutting up the
  mop-board,\n  that it was useless to cut longer for there was no fire. People soon
  began to\n  go away. Mr. Olney showed where he said the fire commenced—placed his
  hand on\n  a particular place and the expressed he used was \n  <em>\"Gentlemen
  of the jury, here the fire commenced.”</em>\n  He had an iron-bar in his hand, with
  which he took off the moulding &amp;c.,\n  to show what the fire had done. It seemed
  that the fire had worked from the\n  inside of the house to the outside—this appeared
  by the boards and timbers—the\n  top of the soil was burnt off, as was also the
  outside—it was rotten so that\n  it might be picked to pieces—the bottom of the
  sill was not burnt. In the\n  north-east room, below, there was in the inside under
  the mop-board a crack\n  which was perhaps three-eights [sic] of an inch in width—the
  fire-place is on\n  the west side of the room—the house fronts the east—the fire
  was in the\n  north-east corner of the room. There was no difficulty, in the opinion
  of the\n  witness, in setting the house on fire in the way it was from the inside—it\n
  \ might have been done by thrusting under-lighted paper, &amp;c. If fired in\n  this
  way the outer edge of the sill would be likely to catch first. Should not\n  think
  that fire could have been put on the outside so as to cause the\n  fire—does not
  think it possible that the top of the sill could have been set\n  fire to from the
  outside, as this sill was. The principal part of the burning\n  was high up near
  the chamber floor.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em>Cross-examined.</em>\n  Saw no fire after he
  got there. Most of the cutting was done before he got\n  there—the weather-board
  was taken up and the mouldings—some clap-boards had\n  been taken off before—it
  was from 12 to 15 inches from the upright post, and\n  south of it, in the corner
  of the room where the fire did most damage. No hole\n  was burned, but the wood
  was blacked—should think the fire originally\n  commenced at the place mentioned
  near the post. The board next the sill, and\n  the side of it next the sill, was
  burned most—this board had a crack in it,\n  and the wood near the crack was charred,
  mostly on the inside. The lathing was\n  burned some, enough so as to black one’s
  fingers—witness did not make his\n  examinations all at one time, but at several—once
  with Dr. Harris.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em>Vine Robinson.</em>\n  On Saturday of the week
  that the fire happened he went, as one of the\n  committee from the Insurance Company,
  to make some agreement, if possible,\n  with Miss Crandall as to the amount of loss
  which she had sustained. The house\n  seemed to be in the same situation as it was
  left immediately after the\n  fire—the clap-boards were torn off, &amp;c. Examined,
  to satisfy his mind, how\n  the fire originated—became convinced that it took first
  on the sill, between\n  the first stud and the post—burned apparently up to the
  chamber-floor, and\n  meeting with some obstruction there, seemed to branch off—burned
  the boards\n  and joist, should think there was more burning in the chamber-floor
  than\n  elsewhere—proceeded to place the boards, &amp;c. round the pilaster as they\n
  \ originally were, in order to ascertain if there was any place where the fire\n
  \ could have been introduced from without—the board at the bottom of the sill\n
  \ was burnet off—the clap-boards were not burnt—found no place on examination\n
  \ where the fire could have been introduced—thinks it impossible to have\n  communicated
  the fire from the outside so as to produce the effect visible—the\n  crack between
  the mop-board and the floor on the inside of the room was\n  perhaps one third of
  an inch wide—no difficulty in putting fire under it—if a\n  match were placed under
  the mop-board and pushed along it would fall about two\n  inches on to the sill—witness
  became satisfied that the Company would be\n  responsible for the loss, and tried
  to settle the amount but could not. It was\n  left to Col. Eaton to procure a carpenter
  and finish the business—the sill was\n  considerably decayed—the fire was confined
  between the first stud and the\n  post.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em>Cross examined.</em>\n
  \ There was a hole burnt in the boards a considerable height from the ground,\n
  \ higher than he could reach—this could be seen from the outside—the board at\n
  \ the bottom was perhaps 8 inches wide—three or four inches of it were burnt\n  off—this
  board was near the post—about the space of a foot along the sill it\n  was charred—the
  sill at the bottom was whole.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em>Ebenezer Sangar,</em>\n  again called,
  testified as to one of the boards that was burnt near the\n  post—the board went
  to the bottom of the sill.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em>Elkanah C. Eaton</em>\n  was also one
  of the Committee with Judge Robinson to settle damages, and with\n  him examined
  to find out the origin of the fire. (Col. Eaton said he concurred\n  in the statement
  given by Judge Robinson, and recapitulated, with little\n  variation, the same general
  facts.)\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em>Richard Fenner</em>\n  got to the fire nearly as soon
  as any one—saw the smoke from the outside, and\n  went directly into the house.
  Saw Miss Crandall and asked her if the fire came\n  from the cellar; she said, no,
  her house had been set on fire. Witness\n  assisted to pry up the hearth to find
  the fire, but found but little—the smoke\n  continued to increase—water was thrown
  on. After the fire was got under, Olney\n  showed the witness and others a spot
  on the outside of the house, where he said\n  the fire began—witness examined it
  more critically, because he did not notice\n  it when he first came to the fire;
  Witness came out of his store immediately\n  after he heard the bell ring, and a
  cry of fire—Saw smoke come from the corner\n  of the house, up some height from
  the ground.—Olney said that when he first\n  came out of the house, he saw fire
  blazing out of a crack, and pointed it out\n  to witness—the paint around it was
  scorched.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em>Cross Examined.</em>\n  The crack which Olney showed
  witness was perhaps an eighth of an inch in width,\n  just by the bottom of the
  sill, between the bottom board and the moulding—saw\n  no appearance of fire when
  the place was pointed out—witness at first saw no\n  fire, nothing but smoke which
  came from about the window casings—Olney was at\n  the corner of the house when
  he got there and had an axe in his hand—it was\n  after the fire was over that Olney
  pointed out this place—perhaps\n  three-fourths of an hour after the alarm.\n</p>\n<p>\n
  \ <em>Daniel Morgan</em>\n  was at the house of Dr. Harris at the time of the fire,
  and noticed a tub of\n  water brought out from Miss Crandall’s and thrown on to
  the side of the\n  house—a little steam arose which led him to suppose the water
  was hot—Charles\n  Harris soon brought an axe—Olney took it and struck a blow or
  two on the house\n  near the corner with it. Witness then went over to Miss C’s
  house, but saw no\n  fire—looked into the house and saw smoke in the room—told Miss
  C. that it must\n  come from the cellar—examined, but found none—a little smoke
  could not be seen\n  coming out from the house, seven or eight feet from the ground,
  near the\n  floor—they had axes and struck in to take off the clapboards—took off
  some but\n  saw no fire till the floor was torn up in the chamber—then saw a little
  and a\n  great deal of smoke, so much that it was impossible to stay in the room.
  The\n  sill appeared natural, but some rotten—took out some shavings which were
  black\n  but not burnt—witness got to the house before any one, unless it was Mr.\n
  \ Robinson—as he could see no fire he was surprised that they had raised an\n  alarm—did
  not see Olney when he first got over to the house—when he first saw\n  him he was
  near the corner of the house—the clapboards which he and Mr\n  Robinson cut were
  as high as they could reach.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em>Cross Examined.</em>\n  Witness saw
  Olney and Harris at the corner of Miss Crandall’s house, before he\n  came over
  from Dr Harris’—Harris soon started to ring the bell and Olney\n  dashed on a tub
  of water—this was before the blows with an axe—the water was\n  thrown on the side
  of the house, between the window and the post—cannot say\n  whether Olney cut off
  any portion of the house—thought that a small piece was\n  cut off at first—continued
  to think so till the former trial, when a piece was\n  shown, said to be cut off—he
  then and now doubts whether any was cut off—Dr.\n  Harris’ house is six or seven
  rods from Miss Crandall’s.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em>Ralph Robinson</em>\n  got to the fire,
  when some of the neighbors were standing at the corner—could\n  see smoke coming
  out—witness tried to cut off some of the clapboards, but\n  could not reach them—pried
  them off with an iron bar—they could then see a\n  little fire—no clapboards had
  been cut when witness got there—did not leave\n  his school house till after the
  bell rung—saw no fire at the bottom of the\n  pilaster—the clap-boards were got
  off in a very few minutes, perhaps three—saw\n  water thrown on after the clap-boards
  were taken off, not before.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em>Peter Spicer,</em>\n  (a carpenter,)
  examined the house day of the the first court (sic). [Mr.\n  Spicer showed the manner
  in which the boards &amp;c. were burned, and gave it\n  as his opinion that the
  fire communicated from within.]\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em>Horace Bacon,</em>\n  assisted
  to arrest Frederick Olney, it was in a barber’s shop at Norwich—a\n  number of persons
  were present—some one asked witness his opinion as to the\n  origin of the fire—said
  that he believed it caught from the inside. Olney said\n  he knew as much about
  the fire as any one. Witness replied, I suppose you do.\n  Olney then said that
  Miss Crandall wished him to fix her clock—that he\n  commenced fixing it and soon
  found smoke in the room—at first thought the\n  evergreens in the room were on fire,
  examined them and found they were\n  not—then thought the carpet was—found that
  it was not. Soon heard the fire\n  roar in the walls of the house ran out and saw
  it burst out from a crack near\n  the corner of the house.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em>James
  Cary</em>\n  read the warrant to Olney in Norwich. Mr Bacon said that he thought
  the fire\n  caught on the inside—Olney said that there was a knot-hole outside about
  the\n  bigness of a dollar where the fire might have been placed. (Witness then
  went\n  out).\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em>Maria Robinson</em>\n  was at Miss Crandall’s house
  at work on the 28\n  <sup>th</sup>\n  day of January, the day of the fire—the stage
  stopped, and the first she saw\n  Olney he was standing by the side of the stage—some
  bundles &amp;c. were\n  brought into the house and Olney came in and sat down in
  the keeping-room by\n  the fire, remarked that it was cold, looking at the clock
  on the mantel-piece,\n  after he had sat a few moments, said to Miss Crandall, “your
  clock does not\n  beat right.” Miss Crandall replied, that she had not noticed it,
  or did not\n  know it. Miss Crandall soon asked him to take off his surtout, and
  said that\n  she had not asked him before because she supposed he was cold—Mr Olney
  asked\n  if Mr. and Mrs Harris were in the house, and was told they were in the\n
  \ kitchen, said to Miss Crandall, “with your permission I will go and see them,”\n
  \ she said, yes—he came back in a little while, and that he had promised to\n  write
  to a lady in New-York as soon as he got there and had seen her little\n  daughter,
  the paper was brought, and Olney wrote and sealed a letter, he then\n  went out
  and witness saw him no more till dinner, when she saw him in the\n  upper kitchen,
  talking with Mr. and Mrs. Harris. After dinner she came back to\n  the keeping-room,
  and a number of the girls were in and out. They all went out\n  but witness, as
  she thinks, (she remarked that Miss Almira Crandall thought\n  she remained after
  her) and witness, who was sewing, laid down her work, and\n  went to the kitchen.
  Had heard Olney talking in the kitchen before this, and\n  had seen him there. Very
  soon there was a disturbance, and some one cried that\n  the house was on fire.
  Witness said it could not be, but ran up stairs, for\n  she remembered that she
  had left her work on the hearth and she was afraid\n  that it had caught fire. Found
  the room so full of smoke, when she got to it,\n  that she could not see the figure
  on the paper. Ran out of doors, and saw\n  Olney standing near the corner of the
  house, looking for the fire. Witness\n  told him that the chimney or roof was on
  fire, he said no, and soon said he\n  had found it. Olney then struck on the corner
  of the house, with an axe, and\n  told her to cry fire. It was about half-past ten
  or eleven when Olney came in\n  the stage, witness noticed no smoke nor perceived
  any unpleasant smell in the\n  keeping-room before fire was cried, don’t know where
  Olney went when he went\n  from the keeping-room, but supposed he went to the kitchen.\n</p>\n<p>\n
  \ <em>Cross examined.</em>\n  Was in the keeping-room when the stage came up—soon
  after Olney came in the\n  clock struck eleven—thinks it was an hour after dinner
  when she was employed\n  sewing—Olney had not been alone in the keeping-room more
  than a minute,\n  when the fire was cried—after Olney had struck on the corner of
  the house with\n  the axe, he called for water—he had asked for an axe before—he
  cut off a small\n  piece of the house, and some one bro’t water—told Harris to get
  the bell\n  rung—heard nothing said about fixing the clock—there were festoons of\n
  \ evergreen hung around the room.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em>Amy Fenner</em>\n  was in the
  school room at the time of the fire—saw Mr. Olney as he came in the\n  stage, at
  about half past ten—saw him no more till dinner. Witness went\n  upstairs to the
  school room, and Miss Crandall sent the class down to\n  read—they came down to
  the keeping-room, and witness saw Mr. Olney fixing the\n  clock—she saw smoke, and
  said to Mr. Olney, What is the matter? What does this\n  mean? She pointed Olney
  to the corner of the room—he put down his ear, and\n  said he heard it roar—then
  immediately called for an axe—witness was very much\n  scared.\n  <strong>Editorial
  note: this is the key testimony, from a student</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em>Cross
  examined.</em>\n  Knows nothing of the letter—Olney was talking with Mrs. Harris
  when witness\n  saw him at dinner—‘twas not more than three minutes after she was
  told to go\n  down with the class to read before she was in the room with Olney—he
  was\n  alone—the door was wide open—cannot tell what Olney was doing to the clock,\n
  \ she was so frightened—smelled nothing in the room before—Olney’s back was\n  towards
  the smoke, he could not see it without turning round—witness could see\n  it immediately
  on entering—heard no walking in the room before she came in,\n  was out of doors
  when the tub of water was thrown on the house—Olney took the\n  tub from the hands
  of Miss Crandall—cannot tell whether the door of the clock\n  was open or not she
  was so frightened—the smoke had just began to come out of\n  the corner.\n</p>\n<p>\n
  \ <em>Henrietta Bolt</em>\n  was a member of the same class, and made a statement
  similar to the last\n  witness.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em>Delano Baker</em>\n  was at the
  fire not long after it was cried—went from Dr. Harris’ wood-pile,\n  saw smoke,
  but no fire was visible—Olney was standing by the corner of the\n  house, axes were
  called for, witness said he could get one. After the fire was\n  over Olney showed
  where he said the fire began—said, “here, gentlemen of the\n  jury, here is the
  place where the fire began.” Witness went away soon, and did\n  not notice where
  Olney directed their attention—saw no fire at the former,\n  when he got to the
  house first; thinks he should have seen it if there had\n  been any; a spot was
  burned up some distance from the ground. \n</p>\n<p>\n  <em>Cross examined.</em>\n
  \ Was a stranger in the place, and does not know the people who were at the\n  house;
  should not know the girls of the house again if he saw them.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em>Augustus
  Prior</em>\n  went with Col. Eaton to examine the house in order to ascertain the
  damages;\n  it was on Monday. (second examination.) [Mr. Prior agreed generally
  in his\n  statement with Col. Eaton, and was of opinion that the fire was communicated\n
  \ from within.]\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em>Ralph Hutchinson</em>\n  examined the house of
  Miss Crandall on the day of the court of inquiry before\n  the Justice; the board
  on the outside, near the crack, was burnt to a coal; a\n  part of the burning could
  be seen from the outside; did not notice whether the\n  lath was burnt or not; the
  pedestal is 16 3-4 inches; the base of the pilaster\n  1 1-4 feet; the mop-board
  was up from the floor a full half inch, a foot from\n  the corner; the first stud
  was perhaps 13 inches from the post; thinks the\n  fire could easily have been introduced
  from the inside; the mortar was gone at\n  the time of the examination made by witness,
  and that being gone, the fire\n  could also have been introduced from the outside;
  if the mortar had not been\n  taken out, he should think it could not have been
  introduced from the outside;\n  witness saw mortar lying on the ground.\n</p>\n<p>\n
  \ <em>Cross examined.</em>\n  The place where the burnt part could be seen from
  without, was by the\n  water-stable; it was just perceivable; should think the fire
  might have been\n  seen at this place from without; the bottom board sets on the
  water-table; the\n  inside of the oak board was burnt very much; the outside not
  much; the fire\n  could not have been put on the top of the sill from the outside.\n</p>\n<p>\n
  \ <em>Chauncey Bacon,</em>\n  at the time that Miss Crandall’s house was discovered
  to be on fire, was in\n  Mr. Jenk’s store. At first, he heard the bell ring, and
  saw people running,\n  apparently towards Miss C.’s house. When he got to her front
  gate, he asked\n  what was the matter? Was told, by a boy, that the house was on
  fire, and was\n  pointed towards the northeast corner of the house; went directly
  into the\n  house and found considerable smoke; some one took an axe, and beat a
  hole from\n  the inside, through the plaster, in the east wall of the room; being
  told, on\n  enquiry, that there was no other axe, witness got one from home and
  beat a\n  number of holes in the north wall of the room; found no fire, and but
  little\n  or no smoke; others were turning in water; witness then went into the
  cellar\n  to look for the fire, but found none; then to the garret, and found none;
  soon\n  after, witness went out of doors and found the people tearing off boards,\n
  \ &amp;c.; some were cutting up the boards in the floor up stairs, and he\n  assisted;
  smoke came out and they threw in water; came down stairs, and saw\n  fire first
  near the cornice, in the room below; could see but a small blaze;\n  ran up stairs
  and told the people that the floor must come up; they took it\n  up, together with
  the mop-board and very soon came to the fire; six or eight\n  feet of the mop-board
  was cut off; the fire was soon got under; witness then\n  examined the timbers,
  &amp;c. more particularly, though he could not do so as\n  he wished, there was
  such a crowd; the lining boards were oak, put on the\n  studs, and ran clear by,
  to the cut-edge of the post; the bottom board, south\n  of where it was burnt off,
  was very snug, so that he could not pass a penknife\n  in the crack; the crack between
  the mop-board and the floor, in the lower\n  room, was large enough to take in his
  little finger, in some places; the under\n  floor boards set on the sill about four
  inches; the upper ones an inch less;\n  should not think it possible to get fire
  on the sill from the outside.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em>Cross examined.</em>\n  He put his
  finger in the crack, between the floor and the mop-board; the\n  widest part of
  it was towards the south, at some distance from the corner,\n  perhaps six feet;
  the floor boards run north and south; put his finger in the\n  crack the day after
  the fire, and has since examined it; should think that the\n  crack was 1-4 on an
  inch, near the corner; perceived no difference in its\n  width at the different
  times he examined it; don’t know whether the sill was\n  burnt at the bottom or
  on the sides; should think the under lining board was\n  wider than the sill; the
  end of the bottom board was nurnt off; the board\n  above it extends along to the
  end, so he presumes this one did; cannot say\n  whether the board burnt off was
  fastened to the sill or not; has not examined\n  the sill south of the stud where
  te fire was; found shavings between the studs\n  after taking off the plastering;
  but few, perhaps three, four, or half a\n  dozen. They were further south than where
  the fire was, between the first stud\n  and post; don't recollect whether burnt
  or not; they were small pieces, not\n  bigger than ninepenny pieces or cents; were
  old, and had probably been there\n  from the building of the house.\n</p>\n<p>\n
  \ <em>John Bard.</em>\n  (This witness was present during the fire, and assisted
  to extinguish it; he\n  gave particulars of the transaction, but stated no new facts
  that seemed\n  material.)\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em>Solomon Paine,</em>\n  with the committee
  from the Insurance Company, examined the premises after the\n  fire. (Mr. Paine
  said he coincided in the statement made by Col. Eaton as to\n  what they saw.) His
  opinion was, that if the lining board was as wide at the\n  place where the fire
  was, as it was farther back, it would be impossible to\n  set the fire from the
  outside; the board was some inches higher than the sill,\n  a little back from the
  fire, where it was not burnt.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em>Nehemiah Ensworth.</em>\n  After
  he got to the fire, to which he was called by the ringing of the bell,\n  he first
  went to the corner of the house and soon went into the house, met\n  Olney and asked
  how the fire caught. Olney replied that he did not know, said\n  he saw it about
  as soon as any one, that he was fixing the clock, saw a smoke,\n  examined, and
  soon heard the fire roar, witness at this time did not know\n  Olney.\n</p>\n<p>\n
  \ <em>Daniel Morgan</em>\n  again called. Saw the mortar taken out from the outside
  after the fire; it was\n  whole.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em>Cross examined.</em>\n  Did not
  state this fact before the other court, though he did to some one\n  present, perhaps
  Capt. Fenner, several persons took out some of the mortar,\n  witness took out some,
  an inch and a half long, took it out to examine the\n  sill, has not examined else-where,
  what he took out was moist, took it out\n  with his fingers, some had been taken
  out before, cannot be positive who took\n  it out; it was after the fire had been
  extinguished; Mr. Flint was present;\n  thinks he took out some; it was under the
  sill and ran perpendicular; the\n  mortar which he (the witness) took out was between
  the stones, immediately\n  below the sill, not more than two or three inches below.\n</p>\n<p>\n
  \ <em>William Worthington.</em>\n  After the fire was pretty much out, Olney went
  up stairs and put his arm round\n  one of the girl’s neck, and asked how many of
  them cried? They said, such a\n  one. Olney then said they had no need to be scared
  before they were hurt; that\n  he did not think the house would burn down, if it
  had, Miss Crandall would\n  lose nothing for the house was insured; witness got
  to the house before the\n  fire broke out; could then see no fire; went close to
  the corner; saw smoke;\n  did not see Olney for a few minutes; no clapboards were
  cut when he (the\n  witness) first got there. Mr. Robinson cut the first as high
  as he could\n  reach.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em>Cross examined.</em>\n  Don’t know how many
  girls were present at the time of conversation he speaks\n  of, shouldn’t know them
  now; witness was a pupil in Mr. Robinson’s school; he\n  was in school, and it was
  said that Miss Crandall’s house was on fire; Mr. R.\n  got there about as soon as
  they did; don’t know whether Mr Morgan was then\n  there or not; saw him soon; did
  not see Miss Crandall; saw no water when he\n  first got there; looked round to
  find the fire, and then went into the house;\n  they had cut a few holes in the
  plastering; saw Olney near the corner of the\n  house first.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em>Luther
  Sangar.</em>\n  (This was also a pupil of Mr. Robinson, was with the last witness
  and made a\n  similar statement.)\n</p>\n<p>[The prosecution here rested for the
