  OF FREDERIC OLNEY.</p><p align="center">  <em>Windham County Court</em>  , ss.<br>  <em>March
  Term</em>  1834.<br></p><p align="center">Present – HON. JUDGES EATON, GRIFFIN and
  CHASE.</p><p align="center">State vs. Frederic Olney</p><p>  The information charged
  the defendant with having on the 28<sup>th</sup>  of January last, feloniously,
  voluntarily, maliciously, and wilfully, set fire<br>  to the dwelling-house of Miss
  Prudence Crandall, in Canterbury, in the County<br>  of Windham, and then and there,
  with force and arms, burning the same. The<br>  information having been read, the
  defendant for plea, said that he was NOT<br>  GUILTY.<br></p><p>  <em>Ebenezer Sangar</em>  was
  at the house of Miss Crandall the day of the fire—did not get there till<br>  it
  was pretty much over. The house was wet, and people were at work about it,<br>  cutting
  up the floors, &amp;c. While witness was in the house, Mr. Olney (the<br>  defendant)
  came in and told Capt. Bacon, who was cutting up the mop-board,<br>  that it was
  useless to cut longer for there was no fire. People soon began to<br>  go away.
  Mr. Olney showed where he said the fire commenced—placed his hand on<br>  a particular
  place and the expressed he used was “<br>  <em>Gentlemen of the jury, here the fire
  commenced.”</em>  He had an iron-bar in his hand, with which he took off the moulding
  &amp;c.,<br>  to show what the fire had done. It seemed that the fire had worked
  from the<br>  inside of the house to the outside—this appeared by the boards and
  timbers—the<br>  top of the soil was burnt off, as was also the outside—it was rotten
  so that<br>  it might be picked to pieces—the bottom of the sill was not burnt.
  In the<br>  north-east room, below, there was in the inside under the mop-board
  a crack<br>  which was perhaps three-eights [sic] of an inch in width—the fire-place
  is on<br>  the west side of the room—the house fronts the east—the fire was in the<br>  north-east
  corner of the room. There was no difficulty, in the opinion of the<br>  witness,
  in setting the house on fire in the way it was from the inside—it<br>  might have
  been done by thrusting under-lighted paper, &amp;c. If fired in<br>  this way the
  outer edge of the sill would be likely to catch first. Should not<br>  think that
  fire could have been put on the outside so as to cause the<br>  fire—does not think
  it possible that the top of the sill could have been set<br>  fire to from the outside,
  as this sill was. The principal part of the burning<br>  was high up near the chamber
  floor.<br></p><p>  <em>Cross-examined.</em>  Saw no fire after he got there. Most
  of the cutting was done before he got<br>  there—the weather-board was taken up
  and the mouldings—some clap-boards had<br>  been taken off before—it was from 12
  to 15 inches from the upright post, and<br>  south of it, in the corner of the room
  where the fire did most damage. No hole<br>  was burned, but the wood was blacked—should
  think the fire originally<br>  commenced at the place mentioned near the post. The
  board next the sill, and<br>  the side of it next the sill, was burned most—this
  board had a crack in it,<br>  and the wood near the crack was charred, mostly on
  the inside. The lathing was<br>  burned some, enough so as to black one’s fingers—witness
  did not make his<br>  examinations all at one time, but at several—once with Dr.
  Harris.<br></p><p>  <em>Vine Robinson.</em>  On Saturday of the week that the fire
  happened he went, as one of the<br>  committee from the Insurance Company, to make
  some agreement, if possible,<br>  with Miss Crandall as to the amount of loss which
  she had sustained. The house<br>  seemed to be in the same situation as it was left
  immediately after the<br>  fire—the clap-boards were torn off, &amp;c. Examined,
  to satisfy his mind, how<br>  the fire originated—became convinced that it took
  first on the sill, between<br>  the first stud and the post—burned apparently up
  to the chamber-floor, and<br>  meeting with some instruction there, seemed to branch
  off—burned the boards<br>  and joist, should think there was more burning in the
  chamber-floor than<br>  elsewhere—proceeded to place the boards, &amp;c. round the
  pilaster as they<br>  originally were, in order to ascertain if there was any place
  where the fire<br>  could have been introduced from without—the board at the bottom
  of the sill<br>  was burnet off—the clap-boards were not burnt—found no place on
  examination<br>  where the fire could have been introduced—thinks it impossible
  to have<br>  communicated the fire from the outside so as to produce the effect
  visible—the<br>  crack between the mop-board and the floor on the inside of the
  room was<br>  perhaps one third of an inch wide—no difficulty in putting fire under
  it—if a<br>  match were placed under the mop-board and pushed along it would fall
  about two<br>  inches on to the sill—witness became satisfied that the Company would
  be<br>  responsible for the loss, and tried to settle the amount but could not.
  It was<br>  left to Col. Eaton to procure a carpenter and finish the business—the
  sill was<br>  considerably decayed—the fire was confined between the first stud
  and the<br>  post.<br></p><p>  <em>Cross examined.</em>  There was a hole burnt
  in the boards a considerable height from the ground,<br>  higher than he could reach—this
  could be seen from the outside—the board at<br>  the bottom was perhaps 8 inches
  wide—three or four inches of it were burnt<br>  off—this board was near the post—about
  the space of a foot along the sill it<br>  was charred—the sill at the bottom was
  whole.<br></p><p>  <em>Ebenezer Sangar,</em>  again called, testified as to one
  of the boards that was burnt near the<br>  post—the board went to the bottom of
  the sill.<br></p><p>  <em>Elkanah C. Eaton</em>  was also one of the Committee with
  Judge Robinson to settle damages, and with<br>  him examined to find out the origin
  of the fire. (Col. Eaton said he concurred<br>  in the statement given by Judge
  Robinson, and recapitulated, with little<br>  variation, the same general facts.)<br></p><p>  <em>Richard
  Fenner</em>  got to the fire nearly as soon as any one—saw the smoke from the outside,
  and<br>  went directly into the house. Saw Miss Crandall and asked her if the fire
  came<br>  from the cellar; she said, no, her house had been set on fire. Witness<br>  assisted
  to pry up the hearth to find the fire, but found but little—the smoke<br>  continued
  to increase—water was thrown on. After the fire was got under, Olney<br>  shoed
  the witness and others a spot on the outside of the house, where he said<br>  the
  fire began—witness examined it more critically, because he did not notice<br>  it
  when he first came to the fire; Witness came out of his store immediately<br>  after
  he heard the bell ring, and a cry of fire—Saw smoke come from the corner<br>  of
  the house, up some height from the ground.—Olney said that when he first<br>  came
  out of the house, he saw fire blazing out of a crack, and pointed it out<br>  to
  witness—the paint around it was scorched.<br></p><p>  <em>Cross Examined.</em>  The
  crack with Olney showed witness was perhaps an eighth of an inch in width,<br>  just
  by the bottom of the sill, between the bottom board and the moulding—saw<br>  no
  appearance of fire when the place was pointed out—witness at first saw no<br>  fire,
  nothing but smoke which came from about the window casings—Olney was at<br>  the
  corner of the house when he got there and had an axe in his hand—it was<br>  after
  the fire was over that Olney pointed out this place—perhaps<br>  three-fourths of
  an hour after the alarm.<br></p><p>  <em>Daniel Morgan</em>  was at the house of
  Dr. Harris at the time of the fire, and noticed a tub of<br>  water brought out
  from Miss Crandall’s and thrown on to the side of the<br>  house—a little steam
  arose which led him to suppose the water was hot—Charles<br>  Harris soon brought
  an axe—Olney took it and struck a blow or two on the house<br>  near the corner
  with it. Witness then went over to Miss C’s house, but saw no<br>  fire—looked into
  the house and saw smoke in the room—told Miss C. that it must<br>  come from the
  cellar—examined, but found none—a little smoke could not be seen<br>  coming out
  from the house, seven or eight feet from the ground, near the<br>  floor—they had
  axes and struck in to take off the clapboards—took off some but<br>  saw no fire
  till the floor was torn up in the chamber—then saw a little and a<br>  great deal
  of smoke, so much that it was impossible to stay in the room. The<br>  sill appeared
  natural, but some rotten—took out some shavings which were black<br>  but not burnt—witness
  got to the house before any one, unless it was Mr.<br>  Robinson—as he could see
  no fire he was surprised that they had raised an<br>  alarm—did not see Olney when
  he first got over to the house—when he first saw<br>  him he was near the corner
  of the house—the clapboards which&nbsp; he and Mr<br>  Robinson cut were as high
  as they could reach.<br></p><p>  <em>Cross Examined.</em>  Witness saw Olney and
  Harris at the corner of Miss Crandall’s house, before he<br>  came over from Dr
  Harris’—Harris soon started to ring the bell and Olney<br>  dashed on a tub of water—this
  was before the blows with an axe—the water was<br>  thrown on the side of the house,
  between the window and the post—cannot say<br>  whether Olney cut off any portion
  of the house—thought that a small piece was<br>  cut off at first—continued to think
  so till the former trial, when a piece was<br>  shown, said to be cut off—he then
  and now doubts whether any was cut off—Dr.<br>  Harris’ house is six or seven rods
  from Miss Crandall’s.<br></p><p>  <em>Ralph Robinson</em>  got to the fire, when
  some of the neighbors were standing at the corner—could<br>  see smoke coming out—witness
  tried to cut off some of the clapboards, but<br>  could not reach them—pried them
  off with an iron bar—they could then see a<br>  little fire—no clapboards had been
  cut when witness got there—did not leave<br>  his school house till after the bell
  rung—saw no fire at the bottom of the<br>  pilaster—the clap-boards were got off
  in a very few minutes, perhaps three—saw<br>  water thrown on after the clap-boards
  were taken off, not before.<br></p><p>  <em>Peter Spicer,</em>  (a carpenter,) examined
  the house day of the the first court (sic). [Mr.<br>  Spicer showed the manner in
  which the boards &amp;c. were burned, and gave it<br>  as his opinion that the fire
  communicated from within.]<br></p><p>  <em>Horace Bacon,</em>  assisted to arrest
  Frederick Olney, it was in a barber’s shop at Norwich—a<br>  number of persons were
  present—some one asked witness his opinion as to the<br>  origin of the fire—said
  that he believed it caught from the inside. Olney said<br>  he knew as much about
  the fire as any one. Witness replied, I suppose you do.<br>  Olney then said that
  Miss Crandall wished him to fix her clock—that he<br>  commenced fixing it and soon
  found smoke in the room—at first thought the<br>  evergreens in the room were on
  fire, examined them and found they were<br>  not—then thought the carpet was—found
  that it was not. Soon heard the fire<br>  roar in the walls of the house ran out
  and saw it burst out from a crack near<br>  the corner of the house.<br></p><p>  <em>James
  Cary</em>  read the warrant to Olney in Norwich. Mr Bacon said that he thought the
  fire<br>  caught on the inside—Olney said that there was a knot-hole outside about
  the<br>  bigness of a dollar where the fire might have been placed. (Witness then
  went<br>  out).<br></p><p>  <em>Maria Robinson</em>  was at Miss Crandall’s house
  at work on the 28<sup>th</sup>  day of January, the day of the fire—the stage stopped,
  and the first she saw<br>  Olney he was standing by the side of the stage—some bundles
  &amp;c. were<br>  brought into the house and Olney came in and sat down in the keeping-room
  by<br>  the fire, remarked that it was cold, looking at the clock on the mantel-piece,<br>  after
  he had sat a few moments, said to Miss Crandall, “your clock does not<br>  beat
  right.” Miss Crandall replied, that she had not noticed it, or did not<br>  know
  it. Miss Crandall soon asked him to take off his surtout, and said that<br>  she
  had not asked him before because she supposed he was cold—Mr Olney asked<br>  if
  Mr. and Mrs Harris were in the house, and was told they were in the<br>  kitchen,
  said to Miss Crandall, “with your permission I will go and see them,”<br>  she said,
  yes—he came back in a little while, and that he had promised to<br>  write to a
  lady in New-York as soon as he got there and had seen her little<br>  daughter,
  the paper was brought, and Olney wrote and sealed a letter, he then<br>  went out
  and witness saw him no more till dinner, when she saw him in the<br>  upper kitchen,
  talking with Mr. and Mrs. Harris. After dinner she came back to<br>  the keeping-room,
  and a number of the girls were in and out. They all went out<br>  but witness, as
  she thinks, (she remarked that Miss Almira Crandall thought<br>  she remained after
  her) and witness, who was sewing, laid down her work, and<br>  went to the kitchen.
  Had heard Olney talking in the kitchen before this, and<br>  had seen him there.
  Very soon there was a disturbance, and some one cried that<br>  the house was on
  fire. Witness said it could not be, but ran up stairs, for<br>  she remembered that
  she had left her work on the hearth and she was afraid<br>  that it had caught fire.
  Found the room so full of smoke, when she got to it,<br>  that she could not see
  the figure on the paper. Ran out of doors, and saw<br>  Olney standing near the
  corner of the house, looking for the fire. Witness<br>  told him that the chimney
  or roof was on fire, he said no, and soon said he<br>  had found it. Olney then
  struck on the corner of the house, with an axe, and<br>  told her to cry fire. It
  was about half-past ten or eleven when Olney came in<br>  the stage, witness noticed
  no smoke nor perceived any unpleasant smell in the<br>  keeping-room before fire
  was cried, don’t know where Olney went when he went<br>  from the keeping-room,
  but supposed he went to the kitchen.<br></p><p>  <em>Cross examined.</em>  Was in
  the keeping-room when the stage came up—soon after Olney came in the<br>  clock
  struck eleven—thinks it was an hour after dinner when she was employed<br>  sewing—Olney
  had not been alone in the keeping-room&nbsp; more than a minute,<br>  when the fire
  was cried—after Olney had struck on the corner of the house with<br>  the axe, he
  called for water—he had asked for an axe before—he cut off a small<br>  piece of
  the house, and some one bro’t water—told Harris to get the bell<br>  rung—heard
  nothing said about fixing the clock—there were festoons of<br>  evergreen hung around
  the room.<br></p><p>  <em>Amy Fenner</em>  was in the school room at the time of
  the fire—saw Mr. Olney as he came in the<br>  stage, at about half past ten—saw
  him no more till dinner. Witness went<br>  upstairs to the school room, and Miss
  Crandall sent the class down to<br>  read—they came down to the keeping-room, and
  witness saw Mr. Olney fixing the<br>  clock—she saw smoke, and said to Mr. Olney,
  What is the matter? What does this<br>  mean? She pointed Olney to the corner of
  the room—he put down his ear, and<br>  said he heard it roar—then immediately called
  for an axe—witness was very much<br>  scared.<br>  <strong>This is the key testimony,
  from a student</strong></p><p>  <em>Cross examined.</em>  Knows nothing of the letter—Olney
  was talking with Mrs. Harris when witness<br>  saw him at dinner—‘twas not more
  than three minutes after she was told to go<br>  down with the class to read before
  she was in the room with Olney—he was<br>  alone—the door was wide open—cannot tell
  what Olney was doing to the clock,<br>  she was so frightened—smelled nothing in
  the room before—Olney’s back was<br>  towards the smoke, he could not see it without
  turning round—witness could see<br>  it immediately on entering—heard no walking
  in the room before she came in,<br>  was out of doors when the tub of water was
  thrown on the house—Olney took the<br>  tub from the hands of Miss Crandall—cannot
  tell whether the door of the clock<br>  was open or not she was so frightened—the
  smoke had just began to come out of<br>  the corner.<br></p><p>  <em>Henrietta Bolt</em>  was
  a member of the same class, and made a statement similar to the last<br>  witness.<br></p><p>  <em>Delano
  Baker</em>  was at the fire not long after it was cried—went from Dr. Harris’ wood-pile,<br>  saw
  smoke, but no fire was visible—Olney was standing by the corner of the<br>  house,
  axes were called for, witness said he could get one. After the fire was<br>  over
  Olney showed where he said the fire began—said, “here, gentlemen of the<br>  jury,
  here is the place where the fire began.” Witness went away soon, and did<br>  not
  notice where Olney directed their attention—saw no fire at the former,<br>  when
  he got to the house first; thinks he should have seen it if there had<br>  been
  any; a spot was burned up some distance from the ground. What is implied<br>  by
  Olney using legalistic language here? Prescience?<br></p><p>  <em>Cross examined.</em>  Was
  a stranger in the place, and does not know the people who were at the<br>  house;
  should not know the girls of the house again if he saw them.<br></p><p>  <em>Augustus
  Prior</em>  went with Col. Eaton to examine the house in order to ascertain the
  damages;<br>  it was on Monday. (second examination.) [Mr. Prior agreed generally
  in his<br>  statement with Col. Eaton, and was of opinion that the fire was communicated<br>  from
  within.]<br></p><p>  <em>Ralph Hutchinson</em>  examined the house of Miss Crandall
  on the day of the court of inquiry before<br>  the Justice; the board on the outside,
  near the crack, was burnt to a coal; a<br>  part of the burning could be seen from
  the outside; did not notice whether the<br>  lath was burnt or not; the pedestal
  is 16 3-4 inches; the base of the pilaster<br>  1 1-4 feet; the mop-board was up
  from the floor a full half inch, a foot from<br>  the corner; the first stud was
  perhaps 13 inches from the post; thinks the<br>  fire could easily have been introduced
  from the inside; the mortar was gone at<br>  the time of the examination made b
  witness, and that being gone, the fire<br>  could also have been introduced from
  the outside; if the mortar had not been<br>  taken out, he should think it could
  not have been introduced from the outside;<br>  witness saw mortar lying on the
  ground.<br></p><p>  <em>Cross examined.</em>  The place where the burnt part could
  be seen from without, was by the<br>  water-stable; it was just perceivable; should
  think the fire might have been<br>  seen at this place from without; the bottom
  board sets on the water-table; the<br>  inside of the oak board was burnt very much;
  the outside not much; the fire<br>  could not have been put on the top of the sill
  from the outside.<br></p><p>  <em>Chauncey Bacon,</em>  at the time that Miss Crandall’s
  house was discovered to be on fire, was in<br>  Mr. Jenk’s store. At first, he heard
  the bell ring, and saw people running,<br>  apparently towards Miss C.’s house.
  When he got to her front gate, he asked<br>  what was the matter? Was told, by a
  boy, that the house was on fire, and was<br>  pointed towards the northeast corner
  of the house; went directly into the<br>  house and found considerable smoke; some
  one took an axe, and beat a hole from<br>  the inside, through the plaster, in the
  east wall of the room; being told, on<br>  enquiry, that there was no other axe,
  witness got one from home and beat a<br>  number of holes in the north wall of the
  room; found no fire, and but little<br>  or no smoke; others were turning in water;
  witness then went into the cellar<br>  to look for the fire, but found none; then
  to the garret, and found none; soon<br>  after, witness went out of doors and found
  the people tearing off boards,<br>  &amp;c.; some were cutting up the boards in
  the floor up stairs, and he<br>  assisted; smoke came out and they threw in water;
  came down stairs, and saw<br>  fire first near the cornice, in the room below; could
  see but a small blaze;<br>  ran up stairs and told the people that the floor must
  come up; they took it<br>  up, together with the mop-board and very soon came to
  the fire; six or eight<br>  feet of the mop-board was cut off; the fire was soon
  got under; witness then<br>  examined the timbers, &amp;c. more particularly, though
  he could not do so as<br>  he wished, there was such a crowd; the lining boards
  were oak, put on the<br>  studs, and ran clear by, to the cut-edge of the post;
  the bottom board, south<br>  of where it was burnt off, was very snug, so that he
  could not pass a penknife<br>  in the crack; the crack between the mop-board and
  the floor, in the lower<br>  room, was large enough to take in his little finger,
  in some places; the under<br>  floor boards set on the sill about four inches; the
  upper ones an inch less;<br>  should not think it possible to get fire on the sill
  from the outside.<br></p><p>  <em>Cross examined.</em>  He put his finger in the
  crack, between the floor and the mop-board; the<br>  widest part of it was towards
  the south, at some distance from the corner,<br>  perhaps six feet; the floor boards
  run north and south; put his finger in the<br>  crack the day after the fire, and
  has since examined it; should think that the<br>  crack was 1-4 on an inch, near
  the corner; perceived no difference in its<br>  width at the different times he
  examined it; don’t know whether the sill was<br>  burnt at the bottom or on the
  sides; should think the under lining board was<br>  wider than the sill; the end
  of the bottom board was nurnt off; the board<br>  above it extends along to the
  end, so he presumes this one did; cannot say<br>  whether the board burnt off was
  fastened to the sill or not; has not examined<br>  the sill south of the stud where
  te fire was; found shavings between the studs<br>  after taking off the plastering;
  but few, perhaps three, four, or half a<br>  dozen. They were further south than
  where the fire was, between the first stud<br>  and post; don't recollect whether
  burnt or not; they were small pieces, not<br>  bigger than ninepenny pieces or cents;
  were old, and had probably been there<br>  from the building of the house.<br></p><p>  <em>John
  Bard.</em>  (This witness was present during the fire, and assisted to extinguish
  it; he<br>  gave particulars of the transaction, but stated to new facts that seemed<br>  material.)<br></p><p>  <em>Solomon
  Paine,</em>  with the committee from the Insurance Company, examined the premises
  after the<br>  fire. (Mr. Paine said he coincided in the statement made by Col.
  Eaton as to<br>  what they saw.) His opinion was, that if the lining board was as
  wide at the<br>  place where the fire was, as it was farther back, it would be impossible
  to<br>  set the fire from the outside; the board was some inches higher than the
  sill,<br>  a little back from the fire, where it was not burnt.<br></p><p>  <em>Nehemiah
  Ensworth.</em>  After he got to the fire, to which he was called by the ringing
  of the bell,<br>  he first went to the corner of the house and soon went into the
  house, met<br>  Olney and asked how the fire caught. Olney replied that he did not
  know, said<br>  he saw it about as soon as any one, that he was fixing the clock,
  saw a smoke,<br>  examined, and soon heard the fire roar, witness at this time did
  not know<br>  Olney.<br></p><p>  <em>Daniel Morgan</em>  again called. Saw the mortar
  taken out from the outside after the fire; it was<br>  whole.<br></p><p>  <em>Cross
  examined.</em>  Did not state this fact before the other court, though he did to
  some one<br>  present, perhaps Capt. Fenner, several persons took out some of the
  mortar,<br>  witness took out some, an inch and a half long, took it out to examine
  the<br>  sill, has not examined else-where, what he took out was moist, took it
  out<br>  with his fingers, some had been taken out before, cannot be positive who
  took<br>  it out; it was after the fire had been extinguished; Mr. Flint was present;<br>  thinks
  he took out some; it was under the sill and ran perpendicular; the<br>  mortar which
  he (the witness) took out was between the stones, immediately<br>  below the sill,
  not more than two or three inches below.<br></p><p>  <em>William Worthington.</em>  After
  the fire was pretty much out, Olney went up stairs and put his arm round<br>  one
  of the girl’s neck, and asked how many of them cried? They said, such a<br>  one.
  Olney then said they had no need to be scared before they were hurt; that<br>  he
  did not think the house would burn down, if it had, Miss Crandall would<br>  lose
  nothing for the house was insured; witness got to the house before the<br>  fire
  broke out; could then see no fire; went close to the corner; saw smoke;<br>  did
  not see Olney for a few minutes; no clapboards were cut when he (the<br>  witness)
  first got there. Mr. Robinson cut the first as high as he could<br>  reach.<br></p><p>  <em>Cross
  examined.</em>  Don’t know how many girls were present at the time of conversation
  he speaks<br>  of, shouldn’t know them now; witness was a pupil in Mr. Robinson’s
  school; he<br>  was in school, and it was said that Miss Crandall’s house was on
  fire; Mr. R.<br>  got there about as soon as they did; don’t know whether Mr Morgan
