scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: Samuel L. Hough (1785-1865) was a prominent white man in Canterbury, working
  as an axe manufactorer. He had enrolled two daughters in the First Academy, and
  had helped Crandall with a loan toward the mortgage on the building. He appears
  to play both sides in these early documents; his presence in the Anti-Slavery Society
  here comes as something of a surprise. He has a [Find-a-Grave memorial with more
  information]. (https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/55307315/samuel-lockwood-hough?_gl=1*1wbgjbe*_ga*MTUyMjQxNDg5NS4xNjU5NTYyOTE2*_ga_4QT8FMEX30*NTkyNjdiOTctODA4NC00MjRiLTk3ZDYtYjM1MmUzMDY2MWZhLjI4LjEuMTY4MDIwMjgxMS41LjAuMA.#source)
