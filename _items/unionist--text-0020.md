transcription: "<p>ANECDOTE.—The following anecdote is related in the London New Monthly
  Magazine for last month.</p> <p>In that inglorious attack on Buenos Ayres, where
  our brave soldiers were disgraced by a recreant general, the negroes, slaves as
  they were, joined the inhabitants to expel the invaders. On this signal occasion,
  the city decreed a public expression of their gratitude to the negroes, in a sort
  of triumph, and at the same time awarded the freedom of eighty of their leaders.
  One of them having shown his claims to the boon, declared that to obtain his freedom
  had all his life formed the proud object of his wishes; his claim was indisputable;
  yet now however, to the amazement of the judges, he refused his proffered freedom!
  The reason he alleged was a singular refinement of heartfelt sensibility: ‘My kind
  mistress,’ said the negro, ‘once wealthy, has fallen into misfortunes in her infirm
  old age. I work to maintain her, and at intervals of leisure she leans on my arm
  to take the evening air. I will not be tempted to abandon her; and I renounce the
  hope of freedom that she may know she possesses a slave who will never quit her
  side.'</p>"
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: This is a serious misstep, as it enhaces a stereotype of the gentle slave
  who remains loyal to the master even when freedom is allowed. This sort of tone-deafness
  doesn't happen much in later issues.
