transcription: '<p align="right">FOR THE UNIONIST.</p> <p> MR EDITOR,—I was pleased
  to notice the account of the “training” which appeared in your columns of last week.
  I have often wondered that a system so useless—(to say nothing of its pernicious
  influence on public morals) and so evidently unpopular among the people should so
  generally have escaped the censure of the press. </p> <p> The evils attendant on
  the training system are great— <em>they are felt in this community,</em> and ought
  to be exposed by every friend of justice and by every lover of good order in society.—I
  rejoice to perceive that you understand the best mode of treating the subject. Sound
  and sober argument will have no influence with those who advocate the present miserable
  system of militia trainings. Ridicule has done more to bring about a reform in this
  system than all the arguments that have ever been urged against it. </p> <p> As
  it is the professed object of your paper to promote the cause of justice and of
  sound morals it is to be hoped you will not let this subject drop. You will be sustained
  by this community, and by exposing the unequal operations of the militia law, its
  uselessness, &amp; its pernicious consequences, you will merit and receive the thanks
  of the people.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  W. </p> <p> P.S. I am obliged to you Mr Editor, for the definition of the term “spirit-stirring-drum.”
  There are some other terms in the soldiers vocabulary that require a satisfactory
  explanation. </p> <p></p> '
scholarlyNotes: It is significant that the letter writers all have to use pseudonmys.
  Not an uncommon practice, but potentially indicates community hostility.
commentary: 'This letter from "W." concerns militia training laws. Apparently a critique
  of these militia training laws had been included in <em>The Unionist</em> issue
  of August 29, 1833 (1:5). This now-missing article also included a critique of the
  "spirit-stirring-drum." These ideas are congruent with Jonathan Dymond''s anti-war
  writings. '
