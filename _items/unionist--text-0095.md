transcription: <p align="right">FOR THE UNIONIST.</p><p>  MR EDITOR,—I was pleased
  to notice the account of the “training” which<br>  appeared in your columns of last
  week. I have often wondered that a system so<br>  useless—(to say nothing of its
  pernicious influence on public morals) and so<br>  evidently unpopular among the
  people should so generally have escaped the<br>  censure of the press.<br></p><p>  The
  evils attendant on the training system are great—<br>  <em>they are felt in this
  community,</em>  and ought to be exposed by every friend of justice and by every
  lover of good<br>  order in society.—I rejoice to perceive that you understand the
  best mode of<br>  treating the subject. Sound and sober argument will have no influence
  with<br>  those who advocate the present miserable system of militia trainings.
  Ridicule<br>  has done more to bring about a reform in this system than all the
  arguments<br>  that have ever been urged against it.<br></p><p>  As it is the professed
  object of your paper to promote the cause of justice<br>  and of sound morals it
  is to be hoped you will not let this subject drop. You<br>  will be sustained by
  this community, and by exposing the unequal operations of<br>  the militia law,
  its uselessness, &amp; its pernicious consequences, you will<br>  merit and receive
  the thanks of the<br>  people.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>  W.<br></p><p>  P.S.
  I am obliged to you Mr Editor, for the definition of the term<br>  “spirit-stirring-drum.”
  There are some other terms in the soldiers vocabulary<br>  that require a satisfactory
  explanation.<br></p><p></p>
scholarlyNotes: It is significant that the letter writers all have to use pseudonmys.
  Not an uncommon practice, but potentially indicates community hostility.
commentary: 'This letter from "W." concerns militia training laws. Apparently a critique
  of these militia training laws had been included in <em>The Unionist</em> issue
  of August 29, 1833 (1:5). This now-missing article also included a critique of the
  "spirit-stirring-drum." These ideas are congruent with Jonathan Dymond''s anti-war
  writings. '
