transcription: Miss Crandall’s School, in Canterbury, Ct. is discontinued. An advertisement
  in<br>the Unionist, signed Calvin Phileo, offers a reward of $50 for information
  of<br>the persons who, on the night of the 9<sup>th</sup>inst. about 12 o’clock,
  assaulted the house, and destroyed five window sashes<br>and about 90 panes of glass.
  Another advertisement offers “the house in<br>Canterbury, occupied by the late Prudence
  Crandall, now the wife of the<br>subscriber,” for sale, from an apprehension that
  the property and lives of the<br>inmates are insecure. The 20 pupils have been advised
  to go to their homes.<br>
