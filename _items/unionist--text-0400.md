transcription: 'Miss Crandall’s School, in Canterbury, Ct. is discontinued. An advertisement
  in the Unionist, signed Calvin Phileo, offers a reward of $50 for information of
  the persons who, on the night of the 9 <sup>th</sup> inst. about 12 o’clock, assaulted
  the house, and destroyed five window sashes and about 90 panes of glass. Another
  advertisement offers “the house in Canterbury, occupied by the late Prudence Crandall,
  now the wife of the subscriber,” for sale, from an apprehension that the property
  and lives of the inmates are insecure. The 20 pupils have been advised to go to
  their homes. '
