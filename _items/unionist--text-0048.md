transcription: "<em>Connecticut</em> BLACK <em>Laws.</em> —We mentioned, a short time
  since, that the Legislature of Connecticut had passed a law forbidding under heavy
  penalties, every individual in that state from teaching colored people from other
  States to <em>read and write!</em> We took no farther notice of it at the time,
  supposing it to be intended as a sort of quiz upon the Yankees, or perhaps a paragraph
  thrown in by some mischievous printer’s <em>imp,</em> to fill out a newspaper column.
  But now seems there was ‘no mistake’ in the matter. A young lady by the name of
  Crandall, of Canterbury, in that state, is now suffering the penalty of that law
  in <em>a prison!</em> Yes, the State of Connecticut, with all its boasted philanthropy
  and christianity—a State which annually sends tens of thousands of dollars to instruct
  the heathen on the opposite side of the globe, in the arts, sciences and DOGMAS
  of civilization, will not allow the <em>free citizens</em> of our own country to
  be taught to <em>read and write</em> &nbsp;within the limits of their state! How
  long is it, we would ask, since the entire population of the “universal Yankee nation,’
  appeared ready to take up arms, break open the prison doors of the Georgia penitentiary,
  release the missionaries, Worcester and Butler, and nullify the law for a willful
  violation of which they had been imprisoned: a law, by the way, far less anti-republican
  and unconstitutional than this Connecticut law, under which a worthy female has
  been imprisoned. Admirable consistency! Pure Christianity! More on this subject,
  anon.— <em>Liverpool (Pa.) Mercury.</em>"
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: This Pennsylvania paper raises a comparison to the unjust imprisonment
  of the missionary Samuel Worcester (1798-1859) in Georgia. Worcester defended Cherokee
  sovereignty and right to education, for which he was imprisoned.
