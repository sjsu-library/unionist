transcription: "<em>Connecticut</em>BLACK<br><em>Laws.</em>—We mentioned, a short
  time since, that the Legislature of Connecticut had<br>passed a law forbidding under
  heavy penalties, every individual in that state<br>from teaching colored people
  from other States to<br><em>read and write!</em>We took no farther notice of it
  at the time, supposing it to be intended as a<br>sort of quiz upon the Yankees,
  or perhaps a paragraph thrown in by some<br>mischievous printer’s<br><em>imp,</em>to
  fill out a newspaper column. But now seems there was ‘no mistake’ in the<br>matter.
  A young lady by the name of Crandall, of Canterbury, in that state, is<br>now suffering
  the penalty of that law in<br><em>a prison!</em>Yes, the State of Connecticut, with
  all its boasted philanthropy and<br>christianity—a State which annually sends tens
  of thousands of dollars to<br>instruct the heathen on the opposite side of the globe,
  in the arts, sciences<br>and DOGMAS of civilization, will not allow the<br><em>free
  citizens</em>of our own country to be taught to<br><em>read and write</em>&nbsp;within
  the limits of their state! How long is it, we would ask, since the<br>entire population
  of the “universal Yankee nation,’ appeared ready to take up<br>arms, break open
  the prison doors of the Georgia penitentiary, release the<br>missionaries, Worcester
  and Butler, and nullify the law for a willful violation<br>of which they had been
  imprisoned: a law, by the way, far less anti-republican<br>and unconstitutional
  than this Connecticut law, under which a worthy female has<br>been imprisoned. Admirable
  consistency! Pure Christianity! More on this subject,<br>anon.—<br><em>Liverpool
  (Pa.) Mercury.</em>"
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: This Pennsylvania paper raises a comparison to the unjust imprisonment
  of the missionary Samuel Worcester (1798-1859) in Georgia. Worcester defended Cherokee
  sovereignty and right to education, for which he was imprisoned.
