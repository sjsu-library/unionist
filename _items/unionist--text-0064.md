transcription: <p align="center">MODERN CATECHISM,</p><p align="center"><em>Adapted
  to the Times.</em></p><p>  Question. Who is the<br>  <em>oldest man?</em></p><p>  Answer.
  The<br>  <em>lad of fourteen,</em>  who struts, and swaggers, and smokes his cigar,
  and drinks rum; treads on the<br>  toes of his grandfather, swears at his mother
  and sisters, and vows that he<br>  will run away and leave “the old man,” if he
  will not let him have more cash.<br></p><p>Q. In what families is there the best
  government?</p><p>A. Those in which the children govern the parents.</p><p>Q. Who
  is the promptest pay-master?</p><p>A. He that deals in promises and is always ready
  to pay “next week.”</p><p>Q. Who is the man of business?</p><p>A. He that can carry
  off the most run without staggering.</p><p>Q. Who is the most regular in his habits?</p><p>  A.
  He that never takes spirits, except to make him “feel better, is punctual<br>  to
  observe eleven o’clock and four o’clock, and never eats his breakfast<br>  before
  he has had his “bitters.”<br></p><p>Q. Who brings up his children in the way they
  “should go?”</p><p>  A. He that teaches them to spend money without earning it;
  mixes sling,<br>  whenever he thinks it will do him good, and always saves the bottom
  of the<br>  glass for little Frank.<br></p><p>Q. Who is the most independent man?</p><p>  A.
  He that “can leave off drinking when he has a mind to,” without singing a<br>  pledge,
  or becoming&nbsp; a member of “the cold water society;” and, like<br>  every confirmed
  drunkard,—who, by the way, was once nothing more than a<br>  temperate drinker,—“does
  not intend to leave off till he gets ready.”<br></p><p>  Q. Who is always ready
  to profit by the pious example of professors of<br>  religion?<br></p><p>  A. He
  who appeals to Dea. W’s testimony that a little rum is<br>  <em>necessary</em>  “in
  certain cases,” and then goes and gets his jug filled upon<br>  <em>credit,</em>  at
  the store of the Deacon’s son, who trades in rum, upon his father’s<br>  capital.<br></p><p>Q.
  Who is treated with the most apparent respect?</p><p>A. He that most deserves to
  be hanged.</p><p>Q. Who is the greatest bigot?</p><p>  A. He that will neither sell
  his conscience, nor barter away his principles.<br></p><p>Q. Who is the most liberal
  man, and the most worthy of public confidence?</p><p>  A. He that has neither conscience
  to sell, nor principles to barter away, but<br>  always floats with the tide of
  popular favor.<br></p><p>Q. Who is the most prudent man?</p><p>  A. He that never
  engages in a work of reform until public sentiment leads the<br>  way; and never
  expresses an opinion, on any subject, until he learns how it<br>  will affect his
  popularity.<br></p><p>Q. Who is the most active and judicious reformer?</p><p>  A.
  He that is most vociferous in preaching against<br>  <em>intemperance,</em>  applauds,
  at every corner, the progress of temperance, and, passing directly<br>  by a temperance
  store, goes half a mile down the street, to trade with one who<br>  <em>sells ‘grog.’</em></p><p>  Q.
  For whom should professors of religion vote, when they go to the polls?<br></p><p>  A.
  Always for the man who is of<br>  <em>“their party,”</em>  though he be an<br>  <em>infidel</em>  and
  a<br>  <em>libertine.</em></p><p>Q. Who is the most likely to pay his debts?</p><p>  A.
  He that spends his estate for rum, and stands ready to go to jail, at once<br>  to
  satisfy all his creditors.<br></p><p>Q. Who is the greatest lawyer and politician?</p><p>  A.
  He that meets his pot-companions in a bar-room or grog-shop, and has taken<br>  his
  second glass. He then surpasses in wisdom and sage remark, a Coke or a<br>  Blackstone;
  and,&nbsp; in the discussion of State rights, qualifications of<br>  great men,
  or the grand principles of the Constitution, an Adams or a Webster<br>  is a more
  fool in comparison.<br></p><p>  Q. Who are the most acute in ethics and theology,
  and the best judges of<br>  preaching?<br></p><p>  A. A bar-room club, who have
  taken frequent potations, and are ready to<br>  criticize the most profound theology
  extant, &amp; to sit in judgment upon the<br>  most learned and eminent divines
  of the age.<br></p><p>Q. Who is the most accomplished young lady. [sic]</p><p>  A.
  The Miss who has just entered her teens, has spent six weeks in a boarding<br>  school,
  seen the last Waverly novel, and, perhaps, to add to her volubility,<br>  has acquired
  a gibbering of French; can prate in the common-place nonsense of<br>  the village,
  has learnt to pass unmeaning compliments, and prides herself in<br>  feeling above
  every honorable and useful employment.<br></p><p>Q. How far can a catechism, “adapted
  to the times,” be continued?</p><p>  A.<br>  <em>    Indefinitely.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>    Gen.
  of Tem.<br>  </em></p>

commentary: 'An age-old habit: pointing the finger of humor at societal declension.
  The <em> Genius of Temperance, Philanthropist and People''s Advocate</em> was one
  of the most important reform journals of the time, and a strong ally to Burleigh
  and Crandall.'
