transcription: '<p align="center">MODERN CATECHISM,</p> <p align="center"><em>Adapted
  to the Times.</em></p> <p>   Question. Who is the   <em>oldest man?</em> </p> <p>   Answer.
  The   <em>lad of fourteen,</em>   who struts, and swaggers, and smokes his cigar,
  and drinks rum; treads on the   toes of his grandfather, swears at his mother and
  sisters, and vows that he   will run away and leave “the old man,” if he will not
  let him have more cash. </p> <p>Q. In what families is there the best government?</p>
  <p>A. Those in which the children govern the parents.</p> <p>Q. Who is the promptest
  pay-master?</p> <p>A. He that deals in promises and is always ready to pay “next
  week.”</p> <p>Q. Who is the man of business?</p> <p>A. He that can carry off the
  most rum without staggering.</p> <p>Q. Who is the most regular in his habits?</p>
  <p>   A. He that never takes spirits, except to make him “feel better, is punctual   to
  observe eleven o’clock and four o’clock, and never eats his breakfast   before he
  has had his “bitters.” </p> <p>Q. Who brings up his children in the way they “should
  go?”</p> <p>   A. He that teaches them to spend money without earning it; mixes
  sling,   whenever he thinks it will do him good, and always saves the bottom of
  the   glass for little Frank. </p> <p>Q. Who is the most independent man?</p> <p>   A.
  He that “can leave off drinking when he has a mind to,” without signing a   pledge,
  or becoming a member of “the cold water society;” and, like   every confirmed drunkard,—who,
  by the way, was once nothing more than a   temperate drinker,—“does not intend to
  leave off till he gets ready.” </p> <p>   Q. Who is always ready to profit by the
  pious example of professors of   religion? </p> <p>   A. He who appeals to Dea.
  W’s testimony that a little rum is   <em>necessary</em>   “in certain cases,” and
  then goes and gets his jug filled upon   <em>credit,</em>   at the store of the
  Deacon’s son, who trades in rum, upon his father’s   capital. </p> <p>Q. Who is
  treated with the most apparent respect?</p> <p>A. He that most deserves to be hanged.</p>
  <p>Q. Who is the greatest bigot?</p> <p>   A. He that will neither sell his conscience,
  nor barter away his principles. </p> <p>Q. Who is the most liberal man, and the
  most worthy of public confidence?</p> <p>   A. He that has neither conscience to
  sell, nor principles to barter away, but   always floats with the tide of popular
  favor. </p> <p>Q. Who is the most prudent man?</p> <p>   A. He that never engages
  in a work of reform until public sentiment leads the   way; and never expresses
  an opinion, on any subject, until he learns how it   will affect his popularity.
  </p> <p>Q. Who is the most active and judicious reformer?</p> <p>   A. He that is
  most vociferous in preaching against   <em>intemperance,</em>   applauds, at every
  corner, the progress of temperance, and, passing directly   by a temperance store,
  goes half a mile down the street, to trade with one who   <em>sells ‘grog.’</em>
  </p> <p>   Q. For whom should professors of religion vote, when they go to the polls?
  </p> <p>   A. Always for the man who is of   <em>“their party,”</em>   though he
  be an   <em>infidel</em>   and a   <em>libertine.</em> </p> <p>Q. Who is the most
  likely to pay his debts?</p> <p>   A. He that spends his estate for rum, and stands
  ready to go to jail, at once   to satisfy all his creditors. </p> <p>Q. Who is the
  greatest lawyer and politician?</p> <p>   A. He that meets his pot-companions in
  a bar-room or grog-shop, and has taken   his second glass. He then surpasses in
  wisdom and sage remark, a Coke or a   Blackstone; and,&nbsp; in the discussion of
  State rights, qualifications of   great men, or the grand principles of the Constitution,
  an Adams or a Webster   is a more fool in comparison. </p> <p>   Q. Who are the
  most acute in ethics and theology, and the best judges of   preaching? </p> <p>   A.
  A bar-room club, who have taken frequent potations, and are ready to   criticize
  the most profound theology extant, &amp; to sit in judgment upon the   most learned
  and eminent divines of the age. </p> <p>Q. Who is the most accomplished young lady.
  [sic]</p> <p>   A. The Miss who has just entered her teens, has spent six weeks
  in a boarding   school, seen the last Waverly novel, and, perhaps, to add to her
  volubility,   has acquired a gibbering of French; can prate in the common-place
  nonsense of   the village, has learnt to pass unmeaning compliments, and prides
  herself in   feeling above every honorable and useful employment. </p> <p>Q. How
  far can a catechism, “adapted to the times,” be continued?</p> <p>   A.   <em>     Indefinitely.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Gen.
  of Tem.   </em> </p> '
