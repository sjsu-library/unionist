  Is the persecution of this benevolent and talented lady either republican or
  christian? Is it judicious to attempt to break her down by violence and insult?
  We know of no distinction in our State Constitution between colors, and we hope
  Miss Crandall will bring her persecutors to a trial of vested rights.” –
  <em>New London Gazette</em>
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: This article from a New London newspaper is intriguing because that city
  had a substantial Black population due to its proximity to the sea.
