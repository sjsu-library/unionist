transcription: Is the persecution of this benevolent and talented lady either republican
  or<br>christian? Is it judicious to attempt to break her down by violence and insult?<br>We
  know of no distinction in our State Constitution between colors, and we hope<br>Miss
  Crandall will bring her persecutors to a trial of vested rights.” –<br><em>New London
  Gazette</em>
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: This article from a New London newspaper is intriguing because that city
  had a substantial Black population because of its proximity to the sea.
