transcription: The transcripts of the Third Trial of Crandall under Connecticut's
  Black Law, held in the Connecticut Supreme Court of Errors in July of 1833, was
  published in pamphlet form by <em>The Liberator</em>, after that newspaper had published
  it in the issues of September 27 and October 11, 1834. As these transcripts are
  widely available, and nowhere mention <em>The Unionist</em> or the Burleighs by
  name, I have not transcribed them here. The full pamphlet is available <a href="https://www.loc.gov/resource/rbcmisc.lst0089/?sp=1&st=text">from
  the Library of Congress</a>.
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: It would make sense that the Unionist would have published this trial;
  there certainly was time in the span between the trial and the attack on the school.
  But until full evidence is recovered, this is speculative.
