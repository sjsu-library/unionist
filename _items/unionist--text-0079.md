transcription: THE SENSES FALLIBLE WITNESSES.â€”When we bathe in the sea, or in a cold
  bath, we are accustomed to consider the water as colder than the air, and the air
  colder than the clothes which surround us. Now all these objects are, in fact, the
  same temperature. A thermometer surrounded by the cloth of our coat or suspended
  in the atmosphere, or immersed in the sea, will stand at the same temperature. A
  linen shirt, when first put on, will feel colder than a cotton one, and a flannel
  shirt will actually feel warm; yet all these have the same temperature. The sheets
  of the bed feel cold, and the blankets warm; the blankets and sheets, however, are
  equally warm. A still, calm atmosphere in summer, feels warm, but if a wind arises
  the same atmosphere feels cool. Now, a thermometer suspended under shelter, and
  in a calm place, will indicate exactly the same temperature as a thermometer on
  which the wind blows.
