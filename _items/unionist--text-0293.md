transcription: "<p>MAJOR JACK DOWNINGâ€™S MAGAZINE</p><p>  The publishers are encouraged
  by the extraordinary demand for the letters of <br>  Major Jack Downing, to issue
  the original and most popular of his writings, <br>  including his life, in a periodical
  form. <br></p><p>  After completing the first volume, should sufficient encouragement
  be <br>  afforded, the Major may, no doubt, be induced to continue his interesting
  <br>  description of public affairs, and other matters. <br></p><p>  This Volume
  will be completed in eight parts of thirty-six pages each, and <br>  will contain
  ELEVEN original designs by Johnston, and furnished in any part of <br>  the United
  States, postage free for one dollar. <br></p><p>  SEVEN copies will be furnished
  to any one address, postage free, for five <br>  dollars. <br></p><p>  Payment in
  all cases to be made in advance, and free of expense to the <br>  publishers. <br></p><p>
