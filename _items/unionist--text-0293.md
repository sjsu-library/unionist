  by the extraordinary demand for the letters of Major Jack Downing, to issue the
  original and most popular of his writings, including his life, in a periodical form.
  </p> <p> After completing the first volume, should sufficient encouragement be afforded,
  the Major may, no doubt, be induced to continue his interesting description of public
  affairs, and other matters. </p> <p> This Volume will be completed in eight parts
  of thirty-six pages each, and will contain ELEVEN original designs by Johnston,
  and furnished in any part of the United States, postage free for one dollar. </p>
  <p> SEVEN copies will be furnished to any one address, postage free, for five dollars.
  </p> <p> Payment in all cases to be made in advance, and free of expense to the
  publishers. </p> <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
