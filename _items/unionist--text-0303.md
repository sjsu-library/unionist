  <p>  ABOLITION OF SLAVERY IN ANTIGUA.—We have received an Antigua paper of Feb. 19<sup>th</sup>  , from which we learn that the Legislature of that Colony had passed an Act
    for the total Abolition of Slavery on the 1<sup>st</sup>  of August next. On the 21<sup>st</sup>  . November, the Governor, at the instance of the Legislature, addressed the
    British Government, desiring to know whether immediate and unconditional
    abolition on the 1<sup>st</sup>  of August, would be accepted by the Government, in lieu of the system of
    gradual emancipation contemplated by the Act of Parliament. On the 13<sup>th</sup>  of Feb. a reply having been received by the Governor, the Legislature met by
    special summons. The reply was then read, announcing that the wishes of the
    Legislature were perfectly consistent with the views of the government, and
    with the spirit of the Act of Parliament. Thereupon an act was passed by the
    Assembly on the 13<sup>th</sup>  Feb., and by the Council on the 15<sup>th</sup>  , of which the following is the principal section:
  </p><p>  Sec. 1.—
    <em>May it please your most Excellent Majesty,</em>  That it may be enacted, and be it enacted by the Governor and Commander in
    Chief of Your Majesty’s Islands of Antigua, Montserrat, Barbuda, Saint
    Christopher, Nevis, Anguilla, the Virgin Islands and Dommica and the Council
    and Assembly of this Your Majesty’s Islands of Antigua, and it is hereby
    enacted and ordained, by the authority of the same, that all and every person,
    who on the first day of August, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-four,
    shall be holden in slavery within this Colony or its dependencies, shall upon
    and from and after the said first day of August one thousand eight hundred and
    thirty-four, become, and be to all intents and purposes FREE, and discharged
    of and from all manner of Slavery, and of and from the obligations imposed by
    the said herein before in part recited Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom
    of Great Britain and Ireland, entitled “An Act for the Abolition of Slavery
    throughout the British Colonies, for promoting the Industry of Manumitted
    Slaves, and for compensating the persons hitherto entitled to the services of
    such Slaves;” and shall be absolutely and forever Manumitted; and that the
    children thereafter to be born to any such persons, and the offspring of such
    children, shall in like manner be free from their birth; and that from and
    after the said first day of August, one thousand eight hundred and
    thirty-four, Slavery shall be, and is hereby utterly and forever abolished,
    and declared unlawful within this colony and its dependencies.
  </p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The vote
    was unanimous. When signing the bill, the Speaker said, in a tone audible only
    to those very near him. “The most important paper to which I ever put my
    hand.”
