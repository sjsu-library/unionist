transcription: The Unionist.’ Such is the title of a new paper just established in
  Brooklyn, Conn. It is edited by Charles C. Burleigh, a gentleman of talents and
  uncompromising integrity; and has for its motto the inspired declaration, <em>‘Righteousness
  exalteth a nation.’</em> In accordance with the spirit of this motto, we find the
  editor is opposed to the oppressive law concerning Miss Crandall’s school, and has
  enlisted warmly in her defence. The other paper in that place is under the control
  of the dominant party, and is in fact the mouthpiece of Judson and his associate.
  On this account we hail the establishment of a new paper with joy. We trust it will
  receive an adequate support from the friends of truth and the enemies of oppression
  in that quarter.
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: The Liberator, the most significant Abolitionist newspaper of the time,
  was an avid supporter of The Unionist from the start.
