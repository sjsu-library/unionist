caption: 'Mary and Emily Edmonson were two sisters who escaped slavery and joined
  the Abolitionist cause in the North in 1848, working with Frederick Douglass and
  others reformers. They attended Oberlin, and Emily, who survived for a longer life,
  did go into teaching. While we cannot discern exactly who the student at the Canterbury
  Female Academy was who received the aid of a formerly enslaved woman, the remarkable
  story of <a href="https://www.nyhistory.org/blogs/the-edmonson-sisters-black-womens-activism-in-the-19th-century">the
  Edmonson sisters</a> gives us yet another example of the striving for freedom and
  for intellectual growth so often seen in relation to Black women''s education. '
