commentary: 'James Whitcomb (1804-1880) was a prominent figure in Windham county for
  many decades. In addition to his medical work - which was extensive - he was a founding
  member and first corresponding secretary of the Brooklyn (CT) Anti-Slavery Society
  in 1835. His first wife, Mary Louisa Whitcomb, was a charter member of the Brooklyn
  Female Anti-Slavery Society. He was a friend to the Benson family, and was known
  by the young William Lloyd Garrison. He was credited with using his house as a station
  on the Underground Railroad; see Horatio T. Strother, <em>The Underground Railroad
  in<br>Connecticut</em> (Middletown CT: Wesleyan University Press, 1962), p. 134,
  211. <br>Whitcomb served as a surgeon in the Civil War, a war in which his son Edwin
  perished. After the war, as a member of the Unitarian Society in Brooklyn, he invited
  Celia Burleigh to preach - one of the first women to be an official preacher in
  Connecticut. Celia Burleigh was the second wife, and widow, of Unionist co-editor
  William H. Burleigh'
