transcription: "<em>A gaol delivery.</em> —The prisoners confined in the county gaol
  at New Castle, effected their escape on Tuesday night. The prisoners were confined
  in two apartments, one on the ground floor, and the other on the second story directly
  above. The prisoners in the lower room, with the aid of a file or saw, cut through
  the iron grating of the window through which they could pass into the ward; the
  prisoners above cut a hole in the floor large enough to enable them all to pass
  through into the room below and join their comrades. They had previously cut their
  mattress, and discharging the contents, converted the ticking into a rope ladder;
  with the aid of which, one of the number, after they had got into the yard, scaled
  the high wall which encloses the yard, and going round to the gate, knocked off
  the lock, or outer fastening, and gave egress to the whole fraternity. Eleven of
  these minions of the moon are said to have effected their enlargement.— <em>Delaware
  State Journal</em> "
