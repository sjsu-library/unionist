transcription: "<em>A gaol delivery.</em>—The prisoners confined in the county gaol
  at New Castle, effected their escape<br>on Tuesday night. The prisoners were confined
  in two apartments, one on the<br>ground floor, and the other on the second story
  directly above. The prisoners in<br>the lower room, with the aid of a file or saw,
  cut through the iron grating of<br>the window through which they could pass into
  the ward; the prisoners above cut<br>a hole in the floor large enough to enable
  them all to pass through into the<br>room below and join their comrades. They had
  previously cut their mattress, and<br>discharging the contents, converted the ticking
  into a rope ladder; with the aid<br>of which, one of the number, after they had
  got into the yard, scaled the high<br>wall which encloses the yard, and going round
  to the gate, knocked off the lock,<br>or outer fastening, and gave egress to the
  whole fraternity. Eleven of these<br>minions of the moon are said to have effected
  their enlargement.—<br><em>Delaware State Journal</em>"
