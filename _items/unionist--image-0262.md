caption: 'Perhaps Charles C. Burleigh here suggests that his editorial rival, James
  Holbrook, should attend the classes at the Canterbury Female Academy. It is my considered
  opinion that the students were likely using some of Goold Brown''s long-running
  textbooks on English Grammar. Goold Brown <em>The First Lines of English Grammar,
  being a Brief Abstract of the Author''s Larger Work, Designed for Young Learners</em>
