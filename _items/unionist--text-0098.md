transcription: The Advertiser man doubts the correctness of our statement in reference
  to the<br>school for colored females in New Haven. If he were only as anxious to
  keep his<br>own columns free from misstatements, as he is to find errors in ours,
  we should<br>less frequently be under the unpleasant necessity of pointing out his
  departures<br>from truth. As to the school in New-Haven, we have only to say that
  our<br>information was derived from Mr. Tappan, and that Mr. Francis Robinson of
  Yale<br>College, (now in this town on a visit to his parents) confirms the statement.<br>

  was
