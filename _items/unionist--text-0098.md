  The Advertiser man doubts the correctness of our statement in reference to the
  school for colored females in New Haven. If he were only as anxious to keep his
  own columns free from misstatements, as he is to find errors in ours, we should
  less frequently be under the unpleasant necessity of pointing out his departures
  from truth. As to the school in New-Haven, we have only to say that our
  information was derived from Mr. Tappan, and that Mr. Francis Robinson of Yale
  College, (now in this town on a visit to his parents) confirms the statement.
scholarlyNotes: I wish I knew what the statement was, or who Mr. Francis Robinson
  was
commentary: Information concerning Francis Robinson would be a good addition to this
  page!
