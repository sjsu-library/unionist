transcription: "<p>   THE LADY’S BOOK,   <em>     a monthly Magazine, of original
  and selected Tales, Poetry, Essays, and     Music, embellished with several hundred
  engravings, and quarterly plates of     the Philadelphia Fashions, superbly colored.
  \  </em> </p> <p>   When, about four years ago, the Lady’s Book was submitted to
  the test of   publication; the proprietors made no professions likely to create
  expectations   which they could anticipate even an improbability of realizing: they
  were   determined nevertheless progressively to adopt every improvement which   diligent
  anxiety to please their patrons should suggest; and have now the   remunerating
  satisfaction, after having faithfully and steadily pursued their   course, of seeing
  it sanctioned by a circulation more extensive than that of   any other monthly journal
  in the United States, and as this extent of   patronage is the most admissible evidence
  of its past utility, it is offered   as the best guarantee for its future excellence.
  The literary department of   the Lady’s Book is of admitted superiority; for in
  conjunction with the great   but boasted liberality with which they encourage the
  development of   <em>Native Authors,</em>   they possess facilities of selection,
  through their foreign agents and   correspondents from works of which   <em>no other
  copies</em>   are sent to this country. </p> <p>   Among the many claims which the
  Lady’s Book has on the patronage of Americans,   the least is not, that it was the
  first publication to present correct   representations of the newest fashions of
  female costume, and in that respect   it may fairly claim a superiority over all
  other contemporaries: for we   proprietors seldom calculate the expense of rendering
  it altogether deserving   of its increased and increasing patrons. </p> <p>   Never
  was the title of a book more justified by its contents than that of the   Lady’s
  Book—Literature, foreign and domestic—selected and original—Engravings   on steel
  and wood, of scenery, distinguished persons, fashions and embroidery,   all rich
  and beautiful, and from the hands of the most eminent artists. Its   literature
  select, free from dullness, though teeming with usefulness, and   conveying pleasure
  and amusement through the extensive medium of delicate   discrimination. To musical
  amateurs of both sexes, the Lady’s Book offers many   advantages, each number being
  accompanied by a popular piece, arranged with   accompaniments for the piano forte,
  &amp;c &amp;c. under the   <em>surveillance</em>   of competent persons, and to
  its pages the general reader can always turn and   find amusement, novelty, and
  instruction. </p> <p>   Each number shall, as hitherto, average 60 pages of extra
  royal octavo letter   press, printed with clear, new and beautiful type, on paper
  of the finest   texture and whitest colour. It will continue to be embellished with
  the most   splendid engravings on copper and steel, embracing every variety of subject,
  \  and the quarterly numbers will as heretofore contain figures of Philadelphia
  \  Fashions, two and occasionally three, beautifully and faithfully colored, to
  \  commence with the January number, being No. 1 of the eighth volume. It may be
  \  necessary to say that these engravings are designed, drawn and engraved,   expressly
  for this work, by competent persons, specially engaged for that   purpose. </p>

  \  L.A. GODEY &amp; Co. </p> <p>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Athenian   Buildings, Franklin Place, Philadelphia. </p> <p></p> "
