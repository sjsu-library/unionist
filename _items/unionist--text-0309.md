  <p>
    The editor of the Hartford Times heads a little electioneering paragraph in
    his last weekly with a line from Campbell’s Hohenlinden—
  </p>
  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “THE COMBAT
    THICKENS—ON YE BRAVE!”
  </p>
  <p>
    He should also have quoted the next line—“Who rush to “glory” or the GRAVE,”
    that all might know to whom the battle cry was addressed.
  </p>
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: The quote comes from the poem "Hohenlinden" by Thomas Campbell (1777-1844),
  and can be found here - https://www.poetry-archive.com/c/hohenlinden.html . The
  quotation is not perfect. The joke, though, comes close. This poem, which highlights
  the futility of war, was often quoted by the Peace activists of the nineteenth-century.
