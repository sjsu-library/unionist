transcription: <p align="right">FOR THE UNIONIST.</p> <p>MR. EDITOR.—It is often said
  that the perpetuity of our peculiar form of government, and the preservation of
  our free institutions, which are in truth the chief glory of our land, depend upon
  the INTELLIGENCE and VIRTUE of the people; this has been so often repeated and so
  universally assented to, that it has come to be a trite political maxim. Now suppose,
  or rather admit, the people of Connecticut to be an <em>intelligent people, </em>what
  will be one of the necessary consequences resulting from the admission? Surely that
  the people themselves examine the spirit and tendency of all laws which are to be
  enforced among them; and further that they see and know that their Representatives
  in the exercise of their delegated power, do not transcend the limits prescribed
  them by the Constitution, which is a gauge in the hand of the Constituent to be
  applied to acts of the delegate.</p> <p>The Constitution was not made for the Executive,
  nor the Legislative, nor the Judicial department of the Government! For whom then
  was it made? The people made it, and they made it for themselves and for their posterity;
  it is then emphatically the people’s; and on its provisions they rely, for its support
  they will contend, and by its spirit and its letter shall their privileges and immunities
  be adjudged. It is a mighty shield, which the humblest citizen may lift up between
  himself and the inflictions of injury by arbitrary, assumed authority; it is a sanctuary,
  to which the persecuted may flee and find ample and free protection; and it is a
  Haven, so safe that he who <em>anchors within </em> it, needs no <em>insurance</em>!</p>
  <p>Such being the Constitution, how invaluable a treasure! What should be done to
  preserve it? Diffuse knowledge through the land,—open the fountains of intelligence,—be
  as Catholic in matters of Education, as you are tolerant in religion,—be in fact,
  what you are in profession,—a Democracy, and let the INTELLIGENCE be, where the
  POWER is, in the People! Then, and not till then, will the symmetry of our inimitable
  form of Government shine forth in the full splendor and beauty of its exact proportions;
  then, and not till then, will the harsh notes of discord cease, and be succeeded
  by a deep and national euphony sweeping over the land, and by its magic strains
  charming to the standard of the Constitution, every lover of his race,—of his Country
  and of his God. Who that is at all competent to examine with understanding the Constitution
  of the U. States—to perceive its checks and balances—where power is imparted and
  where again, it operates with restraining force—where provisions are made for an
  efficient and energetic administration of the government, and in case of abuse,
  the <em>Cavesson</em> placed in the hands of the people—to see with a philanthropic
  ken, the beautiful and harmonious distributions of the functions of Government,
  among the various departments, and above all to perceive and realize that, with
  the framers of this revered instrument, the ultimate object, after all was the security
  and happiness o the people,—who that can do this, will not wish the Constitution
  of his country to remain inviolate, and be desirous that to the Constitutional test
  should be brought every doubtful or ambiguous enactment of State Legislatures? Although
  I detest all petty litigation by which the peace of community is many times disturbed,
  yet I most heartily rejoice when ever I see one of my fellow citizens on whom a
  law, novel in its provisions and doubtful in its tendency, is made to bear, pursuing
  “the peaceful and rightful remedy” by laying his complaint before a tribunal, constituted,
  among other things, to protect the citizen from all unconstitutional enactments
  upon his personal liberty, or his right of private property. The citizen who does
  this evinces a vigilance, and a respect for the great charter of our rights, commendable
  to himself, and worthy the emulation of others. What will be the prospect of the
  Republic, when such a deep and sickly apathy shall overtake our citizens, as that
  they can witness even with partial indifference any infractions upon the Constitution,
  their richest earthly treasure; and if its integrity be preserved, the best inheritance
  of their children, but, when crippled and polluted, their sorest calamity!</p> <p>UNIONIST.</p>
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: The logic here sets up the argument of William Ellsworth for the trial,
  asking the jury to decide on the legality of the Black Law itself. A "cavesson"
  is a type of strong bridle for a horse.
