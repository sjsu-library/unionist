caption: 'Henry Highland Garnet (1815-1882) was one of the most significant and most
  militant African-American activists and thinkers in the nineteenth century. He and
  his family members self-liberated from enslavement, and Garnet never forgot the
  plight of those still enslaved. He married an alumna of the Canterbury Female Academy,
  Julia Williams (1811-1870), and together they taught in Jamaica, where Julia Williams
  Garnet broke down caste divisions. '
