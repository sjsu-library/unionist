caption: 'The full salutation reads "With desires for thy continual advancement in
  the glorious principal of truth and righteousness, I remain as ever thy sincere
  friend, L. White." Lydia White''s Free Produce store pre-dates <em>The Liberator</em>,
  having started in 1830, and extended to 1846, making it among the longest-lived
  of these ventures. See Julie L. Holcumb, <em>Moral Commerce: Quakers and the Transatlantic
  Boycott o the Slave Labor Economy</em> for more on Lydia White.'
