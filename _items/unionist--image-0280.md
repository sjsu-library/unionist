caption: This letter is quite the melange of implied threats, mockery, and insults.
  This cartoon is provided for some historical perspective. It dates from 1856, and
  shows African-Americans manipulating American politics in the direction of disunion.
  This canard is raised in this editorial, too, from 23 years previous.
