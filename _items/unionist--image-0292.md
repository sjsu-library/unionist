caption: 'Attacks on printing offices were serious and not infrequent form of vigilante
  violence. Much like cyber attacks today, attempts to silence an unpopular perspective
  by destroying their newspaper''s offices and equipment were an ever-present danger.
  Many of the most famous incidents in American history of such destruction all came
  with a decade of <em>The Unionist</em>: the attack on William Lloyd Garrison in
  1835 (during which Charles Burleigh protected Garrison), the attack against the
  Abolitionist editor Elijah Lovejoy in Alton Illinois in 1837, pictured here, in
  which Lovejoy lost his life, and the attack against the anti-Mormon newspaper, <em>The
  Nauvoo Expositor</em> that set in motion the eventual martyrdom of that religion''s
  prophet, Joseph Smith, in 1844. '
