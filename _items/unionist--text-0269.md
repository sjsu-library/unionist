scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: "<p>Amos Phelps (1805-1847) was an endorser of the school. His pamphlet
  being locally available suggests, once again, that the students at the Canterbury
  Female Academy were reading about their own struggle!</p><p> <p>\n</p>\n<p>The pamphlet
  in question, for instance, compared the Canterbury Female Academy students to impressed
  sailors (one of the alleged causes of the War of 1812):\n  “The war of the revolution
  was a contest for principle. Had the principle in\n  question been yielded, who
  could have set limits to the acts of oppression\n  growing out it ? So also in our
  war for sailors’ rights, the bone of\n  contention was, the right of search and
  impressment. The mere fact that a few\n  seamen had been injured and abused, was
  as nothing, aside from the principle\n  involved. This, in common with that of the
  revolution, was a contest for\n  principle, and the oppression resisted was the
  oppression of principle. And\n  further, whence the utter odiousness and the cruel
  oppression of the far-famed\n  ‘black law’ of Connecticut? Not that Miss Crandall
  and a few colored Misses\n  are subjected by it to certain shameful acts of cruelty
  and oppression. These\n  are as nothing, comparatively, except as they involve principle;
  and the law,\n  which allows and sanctions them, is itself comparatively harmless
  and\n  innocent, except as it involves principle—principle which puts in jeopardy
  the\n  rights of thousands.</p>  <p>Amos A. Phelps, \n  <em>Lectures on Slavery
  and Its Remedy.</em>\n  (Boston: New-England Anti-Slavery Society, 1834), p. 28</p>\n
