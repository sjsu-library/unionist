transcription: '<p align="center">DREADFUL EFFECTS OF IMMEDIATE EMANCIPATION</p><p
  align="center">[From a pamphlet recently published in England.}</p><p>  Of the many
  persons who declare themselves averse to slavery and yet afraid to<br>  join in
  measures for its abolition, some perhaps have not paid much attention<br>  to the
  instances of emancipation that have already taken place. If any such<br>  will take
  the trouble to read the following account of the effects of<br>  emancipation as
  far as it has hitherto been tried, they will perhaps see that<br>  their fears on
  the subject are not justified by experience.<br></p><p>  The History of Hayti when
  separated from the accidental circumstances<br>  attending it, furnishes irrefragable
  evidence of the safety and advantage of<br>  immediate emancipation. It is true
  that much blood was shed there during the<br>  French revolution; but this was not
  owing to the emancipation of the slaves,<br>  but was the consequence either of
  the civil war which preceded the act of<br>  emancipation; or of the atrocious attempt
  to restore slavery.<br></p><p>  In September, 1793, Polvirel, one of the Commissioners
  sent to St. Domingo by<br>  the National Convention, issues a proclamation declaring
  the whole of the<br>  slaves in the island free. Colonel Malenfant, a slave proprietor,
  resident at<br>  the time in the island, thus describes the effects of this sudden
  measure.<br>  “After this public act of emancipation, the Negroes remained quiet
  both in the<br>  south and in the west, and they continued to work upon all the
  plantations.<br>  There were estates which had neither owners nor managers resident
  upon them,<br>  and on those estates where no white men were left to direct them,
  they betook<br>  themselves to the planting of provisions; but upon all plantations
  where the<br>  whites resided, the blacks continued to labor as quietly as before.”
  Colonel<br>  Malenfant says, that when many of his neighbors, proprietors or managers,
  were<br>  in prison, the negroes of their plantations came to him to beg him to
  direct<br>  them in their work. “If you will take care not to talk to them of the<br>  restoration
  of slavery, but talk to them of freedom, you may with this word<br>  chain them
  down to their labor. How did Toussaint succeed?—How did I succeed<br>  before is
  time in the plain of the Culde-Sac on the plantation Gourand, during<br>  more than
  eight months after liberty had been granted to the slaves? Let those<br>  who knew
  me at that time, let the blacks themselves, be asked: they will all<br>  reply that
  not a single negro upon that plantation, consisting of more than<br>  four hundred
  and fifty laborers, refused to work: and yet this plantation was<br>  thought to
  be under the worst discipline and the slaves the most idle of any<br>  in the plain.
  I inspired the same activity into three other plantations of<br>  which I had the
  management. I all the negroes had come from Africa within six<br>  months, if they
  had the love of independence that the Indians have, I should<br>  own that force
  must be employed; but ninety-nine out of a hundred of the<br>  blacks are aware
  that without labor they cannot procure the things that are<br>  necessary for them;
  that there is no other method of satisfying their wants<br>  and their tastes. They
  know that they must work; the wish to do so, and they<br>  will do so.”<br></p><p>  Such
  was the conduct of the negroes for the first nine months after their<br>  liberation,
  or up to the middle of 1794. In the latter part of 1796, Malenfant<br>  says, “The
  colony was flourishing under Toussaint, the whites lived happily<br>  and in peace
  upon their estates, and the negroes continued to work for them”<br>  General Lecroix
  who published his “Memoirs for a history of St. Domingo” in<br>  1819, says that
  in 1797 the most wonderful progress had been made in<br>  agriculture. “The Colony,”
  said he, “marched as by enchantment towards its<br>  ancient splendor: cultivation
  prospered; every day produced perceptible proof<br>  of its progress.” General Vincent,
  who was a general of brigade of artillery<br>  in St. Domingo and a proprietor of
  estates in the island, was sent by<br>  Toussaint to Paris in 1801 to lay before
  the Directory the new constitution<br>  which had been agreed upon in St. Domingo.
  He arrived in France just at the<br>  moment of the peace of Amiens, and found that
  Bonaparte was preparing an<br>  armament for the purpose of restoring slavery in
  St. Domingo. He remonstrated<br>  against the expedition; he stated that it was
  totally unnecessary and<br>  therefore criminal, for that every thing was going
  on well in St. Domingo. The<br>  proprietors were in peaceable possessions of their
  estates; cultivation was<br>  making rapid progress; the blacks were industrious
  and beyond example happy.<br>  He conjured him, therefore not to reverse this beautiful
  state of things, but<br>  his efforts were ineffectual, and the expedition arrived
  upon the shores of<br>  St. Domingo. At length, however, the French were driven
  from the island. Till<br>  that time the planters had retained their property, and
  then it was, and not<br>  till then, that they lost their all. In 1804 Dessalines
  was proclaimed<br>  Emperor; in process of time a great part of the black troops
  were disbanded,<br>  and returned to cultivation again. From that time to this,
  there has been no<br>  want o subordination or industry among them.<br></p><p>  The
  following account of the character and condition of the negroes of Hayti,<br>  at
  a later period, is taken from “Sketches of Hayti” by Mr. Harvey, who during<br>  the
  latter part of the reign of Christophe spent a considerable time at Cape<br>  François
  the capital of his dominions. “The cultivators who formed the great<br>  mass of
  the population, resided on or near the plantations of which they were<br>  appointed
  to labor. A great proportion of them were engaged in cultivating the<br>  estates
  of the king; if soldiers, they were fed and clothed at his expense; if<br>  regular
  cultivators, they received such a share of the produce as was fully<br>  adequate
  to yield them a competent maintenance. Others were in the employ of<br>  the nobles
  and officers, who received either stated wages or such a portion of<br>  the article
  they cultivated as was deemed a sufficient reward for their<br>  industry, were
  equally supplied with whatever could contribute to their<br>  comfort. And those
  who by their exertions and economy were enabled to procure<br>  small spots of land
  of their own or to hold the smaller plantations at an<br>  annual rent, were diligently
  engaged in cultivating coffee, sugar, and other<br>  articles, which they disposed
  of to the inhabitants of the adjacent towns and<br>  villages. It was an interesting
  sight to behold this class o the Haytians, now<br>  in possession of their freedom,
  coming in groups to the market nearest which<br>  they resided, bringing the produce
  of their industry for sale; and afterwards<br>  returning, carrying back the necessary
  articles of living which the disposal<br>  of their commodities had enabled them
  to purchase; all evidently cheerful and<br>  happy. Nor could it fail to occur to
  the mind that their present condition<br>  furnished the most satisfactory answer
  to that objection to the general<br>  emancipation of slaves, founded on their alleged
  unfitness to value and<br>  improve the benefits of liberty.<br></p><p>  Though
  of the same race and possessing the same general traits of character as<br>  the
  negroes of the other West India islands, they are already distinguished<br>  from
  them by habits of industry and activity such as slaves are seldom known<br>  to
  exhibit. As they would not suffer, so they do not require the attendance of<br>  one
  acting in the capacity of a driver with the instrument of punishment in<br>  his
  hand.—As far as I had an opportunity of ascertaining from what fell under<br>  my
  own observation, and from what I gathered from other European residents, I<br>  am
  persuaded of one general fact which on account of its importance I shall<br>  state
  in the most explicit terms, viz: that the Haytians employed in<br>  cultivating
  the plantations, as well as the rest of the population, perform as<br>  much work
  in a given time as they were accustomed to do during their<br>  subjection to the
  French. And if we may judge of their future improvement by<br>  the change which
  has already effected, it may be reasonably anticipated that<br>  Hayti will ere
  long contain a population not inferior in their industry to<br>  that of any civilized
  nation in the world.<br></p><p>  While the interior of this island was in this improving
  state, and its<br>  inhabitants were peaceful and industrious, Cape Francois and
  other towns<br>  presented scenes of the utmost order and activity: the great majority
  of the<br>  inhabitants of Cape Francois consisted of trades-people and mechanics,
  the<br>  former of whom were supplied by the resident merchants with cloths, linens,<br>  silks
  and other manufactures, which they sold to the natives in small<br>  quantities.
  Their business was seldom so great as to enable them to amass<br>  fortunes, but
  it afforded them ample means of support. Towards strangers who<br>  entered their
  shops, whether for the purpose of making purchases or not, they<br>  were invariably
  and remarkably civil; a trait in the character of Christophe’s<br>  subjects which
  I believe to have been universal. The mechanics, though many of<br>  them were deficient
  in skill from having been imperfectly instructed, were all<br>  enabled by their
  industry to gain a competent maintenance. On the whole, the<br>  scene which Cape
  Francois presented was as interesting as it was in many<br>  respects surprising.
  In few places of commerce could there be seen greater<br>  regularity in the despatch
  [sic] of business, greater diligence displayed by<br>  those engaged in it, or more
  evident marks of a prosperous state of things.<br>  Every man had some calling to
  occupy his attention; instances of idleness or<br>  intemperance were of rare occurrence,
  the most perfect subordination<br>  prevailed, and all appeared contented and happy.
  A foreigner would have found<br>  it difficult to persuade himself on his first
  entering the place, that the<br>  people he now beheld so submissive, industrious
  and contented, were the same<br>  people who a few years before has escaped from
  the shackles of slavery.”<br></p><p>  A gentleman who had been for upwards of twenty
  years past a general merchant<br>  in Hayti, frequently crossing to Europe and America,
  gave the following<br>  account of the condition of the Haytians to Capt. Stuart
  at Belfast last<br>  winter. The present population he supposes consists of at least
  seven hundred<br>  thousand. He said that there was very universal happiness amongst
  them,—and<br>  that though their conduct was not unexceptionable, yet there was
  a less<br>  distress, than in any other country of his knowledge. That they obtained<br>  abundance
  by their own labor.—There were no paupers except the decrepid [sic]<br>  and aged:
  that the people were very charitable, hospitable and kind, very<br>  respectful
  to Europeans, temperate, grateful, faithful, orderly and submissive,<br>  easily
  governable, lively and contented, good mechanics, and that no corporal<br>  punishments
  are allowed.<br></p>'
scholarlyNotes: Ye gads this article is objectionable. It is all about how much the
  Haitians fit European and capitalist models. Subordination and submission, and the
  unquestioned superiority of European thought, systems and people is grating.
commentary: The argument implicit in this account - that once emancipated, people
  of African descent will behave like Europeans, and even retain a sense of their
  place in the hierarchic order - was far too common in these early days of Immediate
  Abolition. This is, to my ears, another misstep along the road to true allyship
  between white Abolitionists and African-Americans. On a more positive note, the
  presence of Haiti as a symbol of Black achievement and independence, was always
  important, as is borne out in the writings of African-Americans like David Walker,
  Maria Stewart, and Henry Highland Garnet.
