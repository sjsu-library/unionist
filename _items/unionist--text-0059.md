  Phaen. e.</em>\n  1054\n</p>\n<p>\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  I dreamed\n  that on a western hill I stood—\n</p>\n<p>A hill that watches where
  the sun goes down—</p>\n<p>And saw the giant of the skies retiring</p>\n<p>In glory
  to his bed‚ the western wave.</p>\n<p>And, as he passed, I hailed the aged monarch,</p>\n<p>And
  said, “O sun, what hast thou seen to-day?</p>\n<p>What signs of happiness—of mis’ry
  what?”</p>\n<p>And he, replying, said—(I stood and wondered,</p>\n<p>Not daring
  on his heavenly face to look,)</p>\n<p>“I’ve seen much happiness for God is gracious:</p>\n<p>He
  ‘on the just’ his choicest blessings pours,</p>\n<p>And even ‘on the unjust’ sends,
  benignant,</p>\n<p>Full many showers of mercies. I have seen</p>\n<p>The husbandman
  go out to labor, singing</p>\n<p>Contentment’s song. I’ve seen the smiling harvest</p>\n<p>Rising
  to meet his hopes and pay his toils.</p>\n<p>I’ve seen his home—like Paradise, when
  first</p>\n<p>The morn of Adam’s happiness beamed on it—</p>\n<p>A wife so lovely,
  babes so innocent,</p>\n<p>That earth’s best blessings seemed to centre there.</p>\n<p>I’ve
  seen the busy village, and the city,</p>\n<p>Where gathered wealth finds by a thousand
  channels</p>\n<p>New means to bless mankind. I’ve also seen,”</p>\n<p>(And angry
  clouds, from up the west arising,</p>\n<p>Proclaimed a tempest near,) “I’ve also
  seen</p>\n<p>Much misery.—The armies joined in battle,</p>\n<p>The shock, the falling
  ranks, the vict’ry won,</p>\n<p>The battle field, where, satiate with the carnage,</p>\n<p>Death’s
  dreadful angel had retired awhile.</p>\n<p>The widow and the widow’s boy were there,</p>\n<p>Searching,
  among the mangled flesh and bones,</p>\n<p>For what they once had husband called,
  and father.</p>\n<p>The frantic maid was there, whose blue eyes streamed</p>\n<p>Love’s
  last but bitterest flood, while on the clay</p>\n<p>That once had been her lover,
  she arranged</p>\n<p>The vestment, taken from a neighb’ring corpse.</p>\n<p>True,
  this was sad, but far more sad the sight</p>\n<p>Of those who sought their friends
  among the living,</p>\n<p>Where liquid death mocks at the play of battle.</p>\n<p>I
  saw the more than widow seek her husband</p>\n<p>Among the bacchanals: she found
  him out,</p>\n<p>And said, ‘when will you come and visit us—</p>\n<p>Your wife and
  daughter—for we have no bread.’</p>\n<p>He turned and looked a look that froze her
  heart,</p>\n<p>And then, relenting, offered her the glass</p>\n<p>To cheer her spirits!
  I have also seen”—</p>\n<p>(And on his face he drew a veil of clouds,</p>\n<p>And
  in the rolling thunder told the story,)</p>\n<p><em>“I’ve seen the manacled and
  wretched slave</em></p>\n<p>Lie down to take his punishment: The scourge,</p>\n<p>Made
  at the shop where Patience, wearied sat,</p>\n<p>And told Invention how ti braid
  the thongs,</p>\n<p>Was brandished in the air; The slave cried out,</p>\n<p>\n  ‘Good
  master spare, O! <em>am I not a man?</em>\n</p>\n<p>But cried in vain, the whip
  went gaily round</p>\n<p>‘Till ‘forty stripes save one’ were fully told.</p>\n<p>A
  woman came:—They heard the earnest prayer</p>\n<p>That nature prompted. O, stupendous
  mercy!</p>\n<p>They stripped her not; but well the lashing to’d</p>\n<p>That not
  gratuitous might she preserve</p>\n<p>Her last remains of right.”</p>\n<p>\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n
  \ “He said, and sunk\n</p>\n<p>Beneath the troubled waves. The storm passed on,</p>\n<p>And
  silence reigned, and heaven seemed to hold</p>\n<p>A consultation on the affairs
  of men.</p>\n<p>And gazing upward, at the bright expanse,</p>\n<p>I heard a voice—“when
  that fair moon is turned</p>\n<p>To blood, when yonder stars have dropped, like
  figs</p>\n<p>Before the time;—the sons of Africa</p>\n<p>Shall be remembered, and
  their might wrongs</p>\n<p>\n  Shall be redressed.” </p> \n <p> *M.*\n</p>\n"
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: This is a not a strong poem, but the union of temperance and anti-slavery
  is indicative of the reform politics of <em>The Unionist</em>
