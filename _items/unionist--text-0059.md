  Phaen. e.</em> 1054 </p> <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  I dreamed that on a western hill I stood— </p> <p>A hill that watches where the
  sun goes down—</p> <p>And saw the giant of the skies retiring</p> <p>In glory to
  his bed‚ the western wave.</p> <p>And, as he passed, I hailed the aged monarch,</p>
  <p>And said, “O sun, what hast thou seen to-day?</p> <p>What signs of happiness—of
  mis’ry what?”</p> <p>And he, replying, said—(I stood and wondered,</p> <p>Not daring
  on his heavenly face to look,)</p> <p>“I’ve seen much happiness for God is gracious:</p>
  <p>He ‘on the just’ his choicest blessings pours,</p> <p>And even ‘on the unjust’
  sends, benignant,</p> <p>Full many showers of mercies. I have seen</p> <p>The husbandman
  go out to labor, singing</p> <p>Contentment’s song. I’ve seen the smiling harvest</p>
  <p>Rising to meet his hopes and pay his toils.</p> <p>I’ve seen his home—like Paradise,
  when first</p> <p>The morn of Adam’s happiness beamed on it—</p> <p>A wife so lovely,
  babes so innocent,</p> <p>That earth’s best blessings seemed to centre there.</p>
  <p>I’ve seen the busy village, and the city,</p> <p>Where gathered wealth finds
  by a thousand channels</p> <p>New means to bless mankind. I’ve also seen,”</p> <p>(And
  angry clouds, from up the west arising,</p> <p>Proclaimed a tempest near,) “I’ve
  also seen</p> <p>Much misery.—The armies joined in battle,</p> <p>The shock, the
  falling ranks, the vict’ry won,</p> <p>The battle field, where, satiate with the
  carnage,</p> <p>Death’s dreadful angel had retired awhile.</p> <p>The widow and
  the widow’s boy were there,</p> <p>Searching, among the mangled flesh and bones,</p>
  <p>For what they once had husband called, and father.</p> <p>The frantic maid was
  there, whose blue eyes streamed</p> <p>Love’s last but bitterest flood, while on
  the clay</p> <p>That once had been her lover, she arranged</p> <p>The vestment,
  taken from a neighb’ring corpse.</p> <p>True, this was sad, but far more sad the
  sight</p> <p>Of those who sought their friends among the living,</p> <p>Where liquid
  death mocks at the play of battle.</p> <p>I saw the more than widow seek her husband</p>
  <p>Among the bacchanals: she found him out,</p> <p>And said, ‘when will you come
  and visit us—</p> <p>Your wife and daughter—for we have no bread.’</p> <p>He turned
  and looked a look that froze her heart,</p> <p>And then, relenting, offered her
  the glass</p> <p>To cheer her spirits! I have also seen”—</p> <p>(And on his face
  he drew a veil of clouds,</p> <p>And in the rolling thunder told the story,)</p>
  <p><em>“I’ve seen the manacled and wretched slave</em></p> <p>Lie down to take his
  punishment: The scourge,</p> <p>Made at the shop where Patience, wearied sat,</p>
  <p>And told Invention how ti braid the thongs,</p> <p>Was brandished in the air;
  The slave cried out,</p> <p> ‘Good master spare, O! <em>am I not a man?</em> </p>
  <p>But cried in vain, the whip went gaily round</p> <p>‘Till ‘forty stripes save
  one’ were fully told.</p> <p>A woman came:—They heard the earnest prayer</p> <p>That
  nature prompted. O, stupendous mercy!</p> <p>They stripped her not; but well the
  lashing to’d</p> <p>That not gratuitous might she preserve</p> <p>Her last remains
  of right.”</p> <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  “He said, and sunk </p> <p>Beneath the troubled waves. The storm passed on,</p>
  <p>And silence reigned, and heaven seemed to hold</p> <p>A consultation on the affairs
  of men.</p> <p>And gazing upward, at the bright expanse,</p> <p>I heard a voice—“when
  that fair moon is turned</p> <p>To blood, when yonder stars have dropped, like figs</p>
  <p>Before the time;—the sons of Africa</p> <p>Shall be remembered, and their might
  wrongs</p> <p> Shall be redressed.” </p> <p> *M.* </p> '
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: This is a not a strong poem, but the union of temperance and anti-slavery
  is indicative of the reform politics of <em>The Unionist</em>
