transcription: JUVENILE INTREPEDITY. On Monday afternoon last, a child of four years
  of age, fell from the wharf at the foot of Northmore street into the water; Thomas
  Bennet, a lad fourteen years old, immediately jumped overboard with all his clothes
  on to rescue him. He succeeded in reaching the child, swam with him to a sloop,
  and held on until assistance arrived. It is seldom we record conduct evincing so
  much courage and coolness, and still more to find it in the case of a mere lad.
  He deserves much credit.â€” <em>N.Y. Standard</em>
