transcription: JUVENILE INTREPEDITY. On Monday afternoon last, a child of four years
  of age,<br>fell from the wharf at the foot of Northmore street into the water; Thomas<br>Bennet,
  a lad fourteen years old, immediately jumped overboard with all his<br>clothes on
  to rescue him. He succeeded in reaching the child, swam with him to a<br>sloop,
  and held on until assistance arrived. It is seldom we record conduct<br>evincing
  so much courage and coolness, and still more to find it in the case of<br>a mere
  lad. He deserves much credit.â€”<br><em>N.Y. Standard</em>
