  MESSRS ADAMS AND JUDSON.</p><p align="right">CANTERBURY, CT. July 19, 1833</p><p>  It
  may be due the public, as well as ourselves, and the town in which we<br>  reside,
  that a concise answer should be made to some of the most prominent<br>  aspersions
  cast upon us, and our fellow citizens, in connection with the<br>  subject of a
  school set up in Canterbury for “colored misses.” We had supposed<br>  that the
  principal facts were understood by the community, so that any<br>  exaggerated statements,
  false accusations, or artful insinuations, would find<br>  no resting place in the
  mind of any honest man. Lest it may be supposed that<br>  we acquiesce in these
  numerous and perverted statements, we think proper to<br>  present for consideration,
  a few circumstances, trusting that those who know<br>  us, will not so readily receive
  for truth, the assumptions of those who have<br>  so liberally bestowed so great
  a variety of epithets upon us.<br></p><p>  PRUDENCE CRANDALL came here with a proposition
  to remove her School from<br>  Plainfield to this place, and establish one here,
  for the instruction of Young<br>  Ladies. The citizens of Canterbury readily embraced
  the offer, and gave her<br>  their patronage. The School, continued from the Fall
  of 1831, until January or<br>  February, 1833. At that time, as we have since learned,
  Miss C. was proselyted<br>  to the<br>  <em>immediate Abolition</em>  faith. She
  started for Boston under a fictitious pretence, and saw<br>  <em>Mr. Garrison,</em>  the
  leader of that party. She returned home and immediately went to New York<br>  and
  came back, as she told us, with an engagement and under a contract, to<br>  receive
  into her school, twenty colored girls, with an expectation of<br>  increasing the
  number to the full extent of her accommodations. The dismission<br>  of her former
  school, and the announcement of this new project, was the first<br>  knowledge given
  to those who had patronized her. It was soon ascertained upon<br>  what ground the
  school was to be established, and what principles were to be<br>  inculcated. The
  levelling principles of the immediate abolitionists, had taken<br>  full possession
  of her mind, and it was soon made known to us,<br>  <em>who</em>  were to be the
  patrons of the school. When we saw Arnold Buffum, and others<br>  associated with
  him, assert what they denominated her rights, and when their<br>  threats were poured
  out upon the town, and all its inhabitants, we could<br>  anticipate the ultimate
  effects upon the town.<br></p><p>  We distinctly state to all who may feel an interest
  in this matter, that we<br>  are not opposed to the education and kind treatment
  of the colored people. It<br>  is not in the power of any man, in truth, to say,
  that we have ever<br>  ill-treated a person of color. We desire to see them free
  and happy. This is<br>  the universal sentiment of the inhabitants of the town,
  so far as we know it.<br>  Our schools admit colored children to equal privileges,
  and we rejoice that<br>  they do so. Those schools are all visited and are under
  the superintendence of<br>  proper boards, excluding all danger, from the inculcation
  of erroneous<br>  principles. The law now in force, makes schools for foreign blacks
  subject to<br>  the assent of the civil authority and select men of each town, so
  that it is<br>  an easy matter to have such a school now, provided that board could
  be<br>  satisfied that no pernicious principles are to be inculcated, and no danger<br>  could
  arise to the town or state. Is not this right? Why should any person<br>  desire
  to force upon any community, a school of any sort, against all their<br>  wishes?
  Have the inhabitants no right to be heard in reference to the location<br>  of such
  an institution among them, and more especially when they know the<br>  dangerous
  consequences to which such measures would tend? Are the people of<br>  this State
  ready to admit that the abolitionists, as they are called, are<br>  diffusing sentiments
  and opinions consistent with the constitution and the<br>  peace of society? Is
  there any individual in the State of Connecticut, who<br>  would feel willing to
  have such a school. Together with all the necessary<br>  evils, situated within
  his own town or village? The answer, will be, no. Then<br>  let the same feeling
  be extended to us. This is the only way to ascertain<br>  whether the town of Canterbury
  has done right or wrong. The distinct objection<br>  which has been made by the
  inhabitants of the town, to the location o this<br>  school within its limits, consists
  in the dangerous tendency of the principles<br>  pressed by the abolitionists wherever
  they go, in language peculiar to<br>  themselves.—These principles are well understood,
  and it would be with deep<br>  regret, that any school should be established and
  continued, for their<br>  advancement, in a community where our friends are compelled
  to reside.*<br></p><p>  The manner in which Miss C. effected the change in her school,
  was very<br>  objectionable, and no friend that we have met with, can furnish any<br>  justification.
  We know of nothing that could have been done by the town, that<br>  has not been
  done, to induce her to remove the school, to some place where<br>  there were no
  objections. She has been urged by individuals—and entreated by<br>  committees,
  who have waited upon her, to give up this location of her school.<br>  We have heretofore
  stated, and we now repeat it that we offered to take the<br>  house at the price
  she had contracted to pay for it, and relieve her from any<br>  loss on that account.
  This was declined, and then the town petitioned the<br>  General Assembly, and the
  law which she, with the advice of her friends, now<br>  resists, was passed. Nearly
  a month after the rising of the Legislature, she<br>  was notified that a suit would
  be commenced by the Grand Juror. At the trial,<br>  her counsel gave in a demurrer
  to the complaint, admitting the facts true, and<br>  submitted to the finding of
  the court without argument. The Court required her<br>  to give bonds of $150 to
  appear at the net Court, which she refused to<br>  give.—This she had a right to
  do, and be committed if she chose. No one will<br>  say that she could not have
  given the bond on the spot. But it had been agreed<br>  before hand, by those who
  directed her what to do, that she should go to jail.<br>  She went and staid as
  long as suited her purposes, less than 24 hours, and<br>  then gave the bond. Some
  person has put in wide circulation, the story that<br>  she was confined in the
  cell of Watkins the murderer. This is part of the same<br>  contrivance to “get
  up more excitement!” She never was confined in the<br>  “murderer’s cell.” She was
  lodged in the debtor’s room, where every<br>  accommodation was provided, both for
  her and<br>  <em>her friends,</em>  whose visits were constant. She was confined
  no where else. It is said in<br>  justification of this untruth, that Watkins, some
  of the last days of his<br>  life, was taken out of his cell to receive the clergy
  and his friends, in the<br>  debtor’s room, because it was more convenient. How
  does that accord with the<br>  statement made? Just as well might it be said by
  those who go into the<br>  meeting-house, where Watkins attended meeting some of
  his last Sabbaths, that<br>  <em>they</em>  had been in the “murderers cell.”<br></p><p>  Does
  any one think or believe that this school, with all its evils, should be<br>  fixed,
  and permanently located here, we will just ask them to consider the<br>  manner
  too, in which this has been pressed upon us, by foreigners or persons<br>  residing
  out of town and State. If they are actuated by the pure principles of<br>  benevolence,
  how much more of that virtue they would evince to the world, by<br>  taking the
  school home to the places of their own residence. What necessity is<br>  there to
  bring persons from New York, or Philadelphia, to Canterbury? They<br>  certainly
  can be educated there quite as well, and more especially if we are<br>  so much
  like barbarians as is pretended. We wish this to be well considered,<br>  before
  blame is cast upon the town of Canterbury. Is not the peace and safety<br>  of community,
  of consequence? It will not be understood that the town ever<br>  entertained any
  danger from the girls themselves, but every person must know<br>  that many others
  will of necessity, be drawn around this nucleus, and<br>  connected with the principles
  of the abolitionists, who will not say that our<br>  habitations, our persons and
  our peace, will be insecure? In answer to this<br>  question, we will exhibit to
  the public, some of the principles,—some of this<br>  christian benevolence,—some
  of this milk of human kindness, extended to us.<br>  During the last week, the<br>  <em>“Climax”</em>  has
  been circulated, and sent us from the Post office in New York, marked with<br>  double
  postage, when the gentleman from whose press it issued, might as well<br>  have
  brought it himself to us, as to others. We unequivocally say, the<br>  ”Climax”
  is a wanton perversion of truth.<br></p><p>  We will invite the reader to go one
  step further. We have received through the<br>  Post Office, from some zealous abolitionist,
  a tract, upon which is<br>  ingeniously written, in connection with the title of
  the tract, so that when<br>  taken together it reads as follows—viz:<br></p><p>“Thus
  saith the Lord, consider your way.</p><p>The Eternal Misery of Hell: this place
  is for whom?</p><p>For Judge Adams and A.T. Judson.”</p><p>  If the reader will
  not be wearied, one other specimen of this benevolent work,<br>  which is going
  on to coerce this State into these Christian measures, as they<br>  are denominated,
  shall also be exhibited to public view. On the 18<br>  <sup>th</sup>  inst., one
  of the signers of this communication had delivered to him by the<br>  Post Master,
  a letter mailing in Pittsburg, Penn. July 12, in the following<br>  language:<br></p><p
  align="right">‘Pittsburg July 10, 1833.</p><p>  “Disgraceful Scoundrel—I have just
  read in the Boston Advocate, that you have<br>  had a white young lady put in prison,
  for taking in her school some colored<br>  girls. From all that I have seen and
  heard of your conduct in this matter, I<br>  must say my opinion of you is this—You
  is (are) a poor, dirty, mean, pitiful,<br>  dastardly puppy. Hypocritical villain,
  a rascal of the lowest order. I cannot<br>  or will not waste any more paper with
  such a Hell deserving hypocrite as you<br>  is. (are.) But this much I will tell
  you, I will be in Canterbury in 3 weeks,<br>  and you may prepare yourself for me,
  for I mean to beat you under the earth,<br>  if I can lay my hands on you. If not
  I will take a shot at you. You poor dead<br>  dog.”<br></p><p>  “N.B. If you don''t
  change your course of life and conduct towards that good<br>  young woman, in case
  I do not meet with you myself, I will hire some Irishman<br>  to mould you. It<br>  <em>shall</em>  be
  done if I have to [pay] five hundred dollars to have it done.”<br></p><p>  “I leave
  you a poor Devil. G.P.”<br></p><p>  “The name of the young lady is Miss Prudence
  Crandall. At the advice of a<br>  friend, [I] erase my name, as I shall be in your
  little Hell.”<br></p><p>  Fellow citizens, such is the temper, and such the means
  employed, to fasten<br>  upon this town, and its inhabitants, an institution of<br>  <em>benevolence.</em>  When
  it shall be fastened here, what will be the effect? We leave them to the<br>  sober
  judgment of reflecting men.<br></p><p>RUFUS ADAMS.</p><p>ANDREW T. JUDSON.</p><p>  *The
  charge implied in this sentence, is a FALSE ACCUSATION. It is also a<br>  recent
  one, and has never to our knowledge been publicly made before, except<br>  on the
  4<br>  <sup>th</sup>  of July last, when it was met with a prompt denial of its
  truth.<br></p>'
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: The circular of Judson and Adams is a revealing document. Outraged and
  petulant in tone, they complain about receiving hate mail, about Crandall's support
  from out of state, and about the content of the school inculcating Abolitionist
  ideas. They give away their ultimate position when they ask "Does any one think
  or believe that this school, <b>with all its evils</b>, should be fixed, and permanently
  located here(?)"
