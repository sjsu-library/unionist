transcription: "<p>  <em>Modern Refinement.</em>  —In the slave-holding States it
  has ever been contrary to law to bestow the <br>  advantages of education on a negro.
  For this regulation there is some show of <br>  plausible reasoning. We were not
  aware, however, that in the very heart of <br>  New-England there existed any such
  prohibition, until we saw it stated in the <br>  public prints, that a lady who
  had been engaged in keeping a school for blacks <br>  in Connecticut, had been arrested
  and thrown intro prison. She is placed in <br>  the same cell which has been occupied
  by a convicted murderer! There is <br>  something quite romantic in all this—inasmuch
  as it savors of the notions held <br>  in olden times—for instance, the chivalric
  days of the Sixth Harry: <br></p><p>  <em>Cade.</em>  Thou hast most notoriously
  corrupted the youth of the realm, in erecting a grammar school. It will be proved
  to thy face that thou hast those about <br>  thee, that usually talk of a noun and
  a verb, and such abominable words as no <br>  christian can endure to hear.” <br>
  \ <em>Nantucket Inquirer</em></p>"
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: Support from Nantucket shows how far the news could travel in maritime
  circles.
