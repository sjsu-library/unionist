transcription: "<p> <em>Modern Refinement.</em> —In the slave-holding States it has
  ever been contrary to law to bestow the advantages of education on a negro. For
  this regulation there is some show of plausible reasoning. We were not aware, however,
  that in the very heart of New-England there existed any such prohibition, until
  we saw it stated in the public prints, that a lady who had been engaged in keeping
  a school for blacks in Connecticut, had been arrested and thrown intro prison. She
  is placed in the same cell which has been occupied by a convicted murderer! There
  is something quite romantic in all this—inasmuch as it savors of the notions held
  in olden times—for instance, the chivalric days of the Sixth Harry: </p> <p> <em>Cade.</em>
  Thou hast most notoriously corrupted the youth of the realm, in erecting a grammar
  school. It will be proved to thy face that thou hast those about thee, that usually
  talk of a noun and a verb, and such abominable words as no christian can endure
  to hear.” <em>Nantucket Inquirer</em> </p> "
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: Support for Crandall from Nantucket shows how far the news could travel
  in maritime circles. The quote of Jack Cade is from Shakespeare's <em>Henry VI,
  Part II</em>, Act 4, Scene 7.
