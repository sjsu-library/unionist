transcription: "<em>Old Hickory and Old Ironsides.</em>—We learn from the Boston Mercantile
  Journal that the Navy Commissioners have <br>concluded it not best to hoist Old
  Hickory on to the cut water of the brigate <br>Constitution, but have issued orders
  for the old head, which is a perfectly <br>plain one, to be replaced. This is very
  well but what is to be done with the <br>carved effigy of the “Old Roman” which
  has just been finished at the cost of <br>three hundred dollars? Wouldn’t it be
  well for our Tammany folks to petition <br>that it may be hung up in the Wigwam!
  With a little gilding it would answer a <br>competent purpose by way of a “Golden
  Calf,” which the bronze worshippers would <br>find very convenient to make their
  genuflections before. <br>"
