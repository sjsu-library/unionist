transcription: "<p>THE UNIONIST is the name of a new paper recently commenced in Brooklym,
  Ct. by Mr. Charles C. Burleigh: the first number of which is now before us. The
  general appearance of the sheet is very good, and from the degree of candor and
  talent displayed in this number, we hail it as a valuable auxiliary for equal rights.</p>"
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: The <em>Antimasonic Intelligencer</em> had been publishing material about
  the conflicts in Canterbury in June and July, and was clearly on Prudence Crandall's
