transcription: "<p> We have heard complaints made relative to the National Anti-Slavery
  Convention that their sitting was with closed doors.&nbsp; This assertion has been
  repeatedly made in our presence, with apparent exultation in the belief that the
  statement would injure the cause—and though we do not love to goad the already desperate,
  truth compels us to assert, that the charge is utterly false. The convention did
  NOT sit, during any portion of their session, with closed doors. We make this assertion
  fearlessly—for our informant is one whose veracity is unquestionable—JOHN G. WHITTIER,
  who was himself Secretary of the convention. </p> <p> We have no doubt but the formation
  of the National Society will madden the foes of liberty, and drive them to the more
  frequent use of their old weapons, vituperation and falsehood, but the cause of
  truth and justice is onward, onward, and its progress cannot be staid. Check the
  flow of the ocean-tide, fetter the leaping lightning, hold back the sun from his
  course of strength, but seek not to impede the march of Emancipation. </p> <p></p> "
