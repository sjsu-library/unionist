  and anxiety to be correctly informed on the subject, that the emigrants into that
  State during the last year were possessed of money to the amount of between six
  and eight millions of dollars. A few years more of such emigration and Ohio will
  be one of the most wealthy and prosperous States of the Union.— <em>S.C. Gaz.</em>
