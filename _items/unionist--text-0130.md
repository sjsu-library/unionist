transcription: "<p>  It is stated by a gentleman in Ohio, who had every opportunity
  and anxiety to<br>  be correctly informed on the subject, that the emigrants into
  that State<br>  during the last year were possessed of money to the amount of between
  six and<br>  eight millions of dollars. A few years more of such emigration and
  Ohio will<br>  be one of the most wealthy and prosperous States of the Union.—<br>
  \ <em>S.C. Gaz.</em></p><p></p>"
