transcription: The Unionist contains a letter of Rev. S.J. May, enclosing a communication
  from Hon. Wm. Jay, of Bedford forwarding some documents, which, had they arrived
  sooner, would have been presented at the trial of Miss Crandall.—The decision of
  Judge Daggett, it will be borne in mind, was made on the ground that free colored
  persons are not citizens. In opposition to this doctrine, Judge Jay quotes, from
  the Reports of proceedings and debates of the Convention of 1821, for amending the
  Constitution of N. York, extracts of Speeches of Peter A. Jay, R. Clark Chancellor
  Kent, and Rufus King, in which the contrary doctrine is maintained.—A letter of
  Dewitt Clinton, Governor of N. York, to President Adams, in 1826, is also given,
  in which the Governor demands of the President, the release of Gilbert Horton, a
  colored <em>citizen</em> of this State, unlawfully imprisoned in the District of
  Columbia.
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: William Goodell confirms that Jay's legal opinions could have made a difference
  at the second trial.
