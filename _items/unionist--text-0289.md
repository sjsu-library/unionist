transcription: "<p>THE PEOPLE’S MAGAZINE</p><p>  This work is published twice a month,
  is furnished to subscribers at $1 a<br>  year. It contains a large mass of information,
  and is designed as an amusing<br>  and instructive miscellany for families. Each
  number is illustrated by a<br>  number of beautiful engravings on wood, illustrative
  of some object of<br>  interest, some incident in history, or some scene described
  in the work. The<br>  publishers have the satisfaction to state that the number
  of subscribers is<br>  now about 15,000; and while about 200 journals in the United
  States have<br>  expressed their approbation of it, we know of no instance in which
  an<br>  unfavorable opinion has been expressed.<br></p><p>  We state these circumstances,
  in the hope of extending the interest in a work,<br>  which is calculated to be
  of extensive utility. It is among the cheapest<br>  periodicals of the United States.<br></p><p>
  \ The price of this Magazine is one dollar a year—six copies for $5—20 copies<br>
  \ for fifteen dollars—or twenty-five quarterly parts for five dollars. Payment<br>
  \ in all cases to be made in advance. Nov. 27<br></p><p></p>"
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: This general interest magazine was admired for its engravings. The whimsical
  quality of "Animal Associations" can hold its attraction across time.
