  <p>THE PEOPLE’S MAGAZINE</p>
  <p>
    This work is published twice a month, is furnished to subscribers at $1 a
    year. It contains a large mass of information, and is designed as an amusing
    and instructive miscellany for families. Each number is illustrated by a
    number of beautiful engravings on wood, illustrative of some object of
    interest, some incident in history, or some scene described in the work. The
    publishers have the satisfaction to state that the number of subscribers is
    now about 15,000; and while about 200 journals in the United States have
    expressed their approbation of it, we know of no instance in which an
    unfavorable opinion has been expressed.
  </p>
  <p>
    We state these circumstances, in the hope of extending the interest in a work,
    which is calculated to be of extensive utility. It is among the cheapest
    periodicals of the United States.
  </p>
  <p>
    The price of this Magazine is one dollar a year—six copies for $5—20 copies
    for fifteen dollars—or twenty-five quarterly parts for five dollars. Payment
    in all cases to be made in advance. Nov. 27

scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: This general interest magazine was admired for its engravings. The whimsical
  quality of "Animal Associations" can hold its attraction across time.
