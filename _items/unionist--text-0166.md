scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: 'G. Tillotson was Rev. George Jeffrey Tillotson (1805-1888), Congregational
  minister of Brooklyn Connecticut. He was the minister who agreed to officiate the
  marriage of Prudence Crandall and Calvin Philleo, when the Congregational minister
  of Canterbury declined on the day of the wedding. He had begun his ministerial career
  in Brooklyn with the Execution Sermon for Oliver Watkins, the murderer whose cell
  in the Brooklyn Jail later housed Prudence Crandall. For the text of that sermon,
  see <em>Windham County Advertiser</em>, 5:52 (August 2, 1831), p. 3. Tillotson had
  a personal friendship with Abolitionist and Crandall endorser Amos A. Phelps; see
  the collection of letters digitized here: - https://www.digitalcommonwealth.org/search?f%5Bname_facet_ssim%5D%5B%5D=Tillotson%2C+George+Jeffrey%2C+1805-1888
  . After the Civil War, he donated substantially to an institution of higher learning
  for Freedmen in Austin, Texas, which was named the Tillotson Institute in his honor

  The school still exists today, as Huston-Tillotson University , an HBCU in Austin.
  There was a full article on the progress of the Tillotson Institute in <em>The American
  Missionary</em> v. 65 p. 85 (May, 1911)'
