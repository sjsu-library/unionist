transcription: "<p>  The Unionist says that we “exposed nothing but our own ignorance”—Indeed?
  If<br>  we exhibit nothing else, we may be considered very happy. There are some
  that<br>  we wot of who<br>  <em>do</em>  expose something besides their ignorance—videlicet,
  a goodly share of<br>  self-conceit—and they are so placed side by side as to be
  equally conspicuous.<br></p><p>  There is nothing of which we are more sensible
  than our own deficiencies, but<br>  some of the<br>  <em>wise ones</em>  who occasionally
  put us in mind of them, neither point them out nor suggest<br>  their remedy, &amp;
  we of course must remain in our ignorance. We cannot boast<br>  of our acquirements.<br></p><p>
  \ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Knowledge<br>
  \ and wisdom, far from being one,<br></p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  “Have<br>  ofttimes no connexion—<br></p><p>  *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  \ *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>  *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  \ *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br></p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  “Knowledge<br>  is<br>  <em>proud that he has learn’d so much</em>  ;<br></p><p>
  \ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Wisdom is<br>
  \ humble that he knows no more.”<br></p>"
