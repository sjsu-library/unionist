transcription: "<p> The Unionist says that we “exposed nothing but our own ignorance”—Indeed?
  If we exhibit nothing else, we may be considered very happy. There are some that
  we wot of who <em>do</em> expose something besides their ignorance—videlicet, a
  goodly share of self-conceit—and they are so placed side by side as to be equally
  conspicuous. </p> <p> There is nothing of which we are more sensible than our own
  deficiencies, but some of the <em>wise ones</em> who occasionally put us in mind
  of them, neither point them out nor suggest their remedy, &amp; we of course must
  remain in our ignorance. We cannot boast of our acquirements. </p> <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  “Knowledge and wisdom, far from being one, </p> <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  “Have ofttimes no connexion— </p> <p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * </p> <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  “Knowledge is <em>proud that he has learn’d so much</em> ; </p> <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  “Wisdom is humble that he knows no more.” </p> "
scholarlyNotes: Slight Unionist content in here.
commentary: It seems that the trading of insults between these two papers is rising
  to the level of a game of Dozens.
