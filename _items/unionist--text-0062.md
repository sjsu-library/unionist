transcription: "<p>   (We extract the following from Professor Wright’s pamphlet,
  entitled “The Sin   of Slavery, and its Remedy.) </p> <p>   The American revolution
  was incomplete. It left one sixth part of the   population the victims of a servitude
  immeasurably more debasing, than that   from which it delivered the rest. While
  this nation held up its declaration of   independence—its noble bill of human rights,
  before an admiring world, in one   hand; it mortified the friends of humanity, by
  oppressing the poor and   defenceless with the other. The progress of time has not
  lessened the evil.   There are now held in involuntary and perpetual slavery, in
  the southern half   of this republic, more than 2,000,000 of men, women, and children,
  guarded   with a vigilance, which strives, and with success appalling as it is complete,
  \  to shut out every ray of knowledge, human and divine, and reduce them as   nearly
  as possible to a level with the brutes. These miserable slaves are not   only compelled
  to labor without choice and without hire, but they are   subjected to the cruelty
  and lust of their masters to an unbounded extent. In   the northern states there
  is very generally a sympathy with the slave-holders,   and a prejudice against the
  slaves, which shows itself in palliating the crime   of slave-holding, and in most
  unrighteously disregarding the rights, and   vilifying the characters of the free
  colored men. </p> <p>   At the same time, slavery, as a system, is (in a certain
  sense) condemned. It   is confessed to be a great evil, “a moral evil,” and, when
  the point is urged,   <em>a sin.</em>   The slaves, it is admitted, have rights—every
  principle of honesty, justice,   and humanity,   <em>“in the abstract,”</em>   calls
  aloud that they should be made free. The word of God is in their favour.   Indeed,
  there is no ground claimed by the abettors of slavery, on which they   pretend to
  justify it for a moment, but a supposed—a begged—   <em>expediency,</em>   baseless
  as the driven clouds. I say baseless, for while not a single fact has   ever been
  produced, going to show the danger of putting the slaves, all at   once, under the
  protection of law, and employing them as free laborers, there   have been produced,
  on the other side, varied and fair experiments showing,   that it is altogether
  safe and profitable. </p> <p>   In this state of things where had the American church
  stood? Has she too   sympathized with the hearts of the Pharaohs? Or has she in
  the spirit of the   martyrs of former times, borne an unflinching testimony against
  this sin?   Alas! The painful truth stares us in the face. She has come down from
  the high   and firm foundation of scripture truth, and is professedly at work upon
  a   floating   <em>expediency,</em>   doing against slavery what can be done upon
  the checked current of popular   prejudice.—Speaking through the organ of the Colonization
  Society, she has   admitted all that the most determined slave-holder could ask,
  and she is doing   just that, and no more, which so far as he understands the subject,
  he hails   with pleasure as a safeguard to is property in human bodies and   <em>souls.</em>
  \  This is the testimony of slave-holders themselves—most competent witnesses. </p>
  <p>   Is further evidence needed? When the American Colonization Society, as a   remedy
  for slavery, has been called in question, as well it might be for its   tardiness,
  if for no other reason, there has been manifested a determination   to hush inquiry.
  There has been a most pusillanimous shivering and shrinking   from the probe. Nay,
  the few men who, in the uncompromising spirit of   Christian benevolence, have urged
  this inquiry, have been slandered as   disturbers of the public peace,—have been
  assailed with abusive epithets, not   be slave-holders only, but by their brethren
  in the bosom of the church. </p> <p>   A most singular spectacle is presented in
  this enlightened and Christian age;   a handful of philanthropists, dare denounce
  a system of legalized oppression,   and to charge guilt upon all who uphold it;
  upon this, not only do the   principals in crime, as might be expected, ascribe
  the whole to sheer malice,   but the leaders of the Christian church, as ought not
  to be expected, endorse,   and give currency to the charge, and throw the whole
  weight of their cold and   crushing influence to smother in its cradle this attempt
  at a gospel   reformation. </p> <p>   What does all this mean? Are Christians in
  these northern states interested in   upholding slavery? Are they unwilling to be
  convinced that their colored   brethren are better than the slanders of their oppressors
  would make them? Are   they sure, beyond a doubt, that the colonization scheme will
  relieve our   country of the mighty evil which is crushing it? that it is the   <em>Christian</em>
  \  way to relieve it? Are they on good evidence convinced that it is not   <em>expedient</em>
  \  to say to the wicked, “O wicked man, thou shalt surely die?” Must they have   PEACE
  at any rate—peace, though the groans of millions should ascend and   mingle with
  the muttering thunders of coming wrath? Will they have it, that if   a word is said
  against a mere experiment to test the practicability of   rescuing the victim by
  flattering the oppressor, the whole cause of Christian   benevolence is attacked?
  If not, why not welcome inquiry? A thorough   investigation—a looking on   <em>both
  sides,</em>   would surely do no harm. Those defenders of truth who have shunned
  such   inquiry, have always proved themselves short-sighted. The cause of God courts
  \  scrutiny—its advocates are thrown into no unseemly agitation when they are   most
  rigorously sifted. </p> <p>   The subject cries aloud for more earnest consideration
  than it has yet   received. More than two millions of outraged, downtrodden men
  cry out, shall   we die in this sore bondage that white Christians may have the
  pleasure of   attempting to shun God’s wrath without repenting of sin?—Half a million
  of   free colored men cry out—America is our country—the land for which   <em>our</em>
  \  fathers bled as well as yours. Why will you seek to banish us? The wrongs of
  \  the poor Indian cry aloud, There is no safety in league with transgressors!   The
  present political aspect of the South cries out, that tyrants do not   regard law!
  Six hundred millions of idolaters cry out to the American church,   “Why pluckest
  thou the mote out of thy brother’s eye, and behold a beam is in   thine own!” </p> "
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: 'It is meaningful that this important work was in the hands of the students
  at the Canterbury Female Academy. Elizur Wright''s pamphlet announces the transformative
  vision of the Abolitionist movement from its stirring first sentence: "The American
  revolution was incomplete."'
