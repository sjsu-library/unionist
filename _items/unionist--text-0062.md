transcription: "<p>  (We extract the following from Professor Wright’s pamphlet, entitled
  “The Sin <br>  of Slavery, and its Remedy.) <br></p><p>  The American revolution
  was incomplete. It left one sixth part of the <br>  population the victims of a
  servitude immeasurably more debasing, than that <br>  from which it delivered the
  rest. While this nation held up its declaration of <br>  independence—its noble
  bill of human rights, before an admiring world, in one <br>  hand; it mortified
  the friends of humanity, by oppressing the poor and <br>  defenceless with the other.
  The progress of time has not lessened the evil. <br>  There are now held in involuntary
  and perpetual slavery, in the southern half <br>  of this republic, more than 2,000,000
  of men, women, and children, guarded <br>  with a vigilance, which strives, and
  with success appalling as it is complete, <br>  to shut out every ray of knowledge,
  human and divine, and reduce them as <br>  nearly as possible to a level with the
  brutes. These miserable slaves are not <br>  only compelled to labor without choice
  and without hire, but they are <br>  subjected to the cruelty and lust of their
  masters to an unbounded extent. I <br>  the northern states there is very generally
  a sympathy with the slave-holders, <br>  and a prejudice against the slaves, which
  shows itself in palliating the crime <br>  of slave-holding, and in most unrighteously
  disregarding the rights, and <br>  vilifying the characters of the free colored
  men. <br></p><p>  At the same time, slavery, as a system, is (in a certain sense)
  condemned. It <br>  is confessed to be a great evil, “a moral evil,” and, when the
  point is urged, <br>  <em>a sin.</em>  The slaves, it is admitted, have rights—every
  principle of honesty, justice, <br>  and humanity, <br>  <em>“in the abstract,”</em>
  \ calls aloud that they should be made free. The word of God is in their favour.
  <br>  Indeed, there is no ground claimed by the abettors of slavery, on which they
  <br>  pretend to justify it for a moment, but a supposed—a begged— <br>  <em>expediency,</em>
  \ baseless as the driven clouds. I say baseless, for while not a single fact has
  <br>  ever been produced, going to show the danger of putting the slaves, all at
  <br>  once, under the protection of law, and employing them as free laborers, there
  <br>  have been produced, on the other side, varied and fair experiments showing,
  <br>  that it is altogether safe and profitable. <br></p><p>  In this state of things
  where had the American church stood? Has she too <br>  sympathized with the hearts
  of the Pharaohs? Or has she in the spirit of the <br>  martyrs of former times,
  borne an unflinching testimony against this sin? <br>  Alas! The painful truth stares
  us in the face. She has come down from the high <br>  and firm foundation of scripture
  truth, and is professedly at work upon a <br>  floating <br>  <em>expediency,</em>
  \ doing against slavery what cab be done upon the checked current of popular <br>
  \ prejudice.—Speaking through the organ of the Colonization Society, she has <br>
  \ admitted all that the most determined slave-holder could ask, and she is doing
  <br>  just that, and no more, which so far as he understands the subject, he hails
  <br>  with pleasure as a safeguard to is property in human bodies and <br>  <em>souls.</em>
  \ This is the testimony of slave-holders themselves—most competent witnesses. <br></p><p>
  \ Is further evidence needed? When the American Colonization Society, as a <br>
  \ remedy for slavery, has been called in question, as well it might be for its <br>
  \ tardiness, if for no other reason, there has been manifested a determination <br>
  \ to hush inquiry. There has been a most pusillanimous shivering and shrinking <br>
  \ from the probe. Nay, the few men who, in the uncompromising spirit of <br>  Christian
  benevolence, have urged this inquiry, have been slandered as <br>  disturbers of
  the public peace,—have been assailed with abusive epithets, not <br>  be slave-holders
  only, but by their brethren in the bosom of the church. <br></p><p>  A most singular
  spectacle is presented in this enlightened and Christian age; <br>  a handful of
  philanthropists, dare denounce a system of legalized oppression, <br>  and to charge
  guilt upon all who uphold it; upon this, not only do the <br>  principals in crime,
  as might be expected, ascribe the whole to sheer malice, <br>  but the leaders of
  the Christian church, as ought not to be expected, endorse, <br>  and give currency
  to the charge, and throw the whole weight of their cold and <br>  crushing influence
  to smother in its cradle this attempt at a gospel <br>  reformation. <br></p><p>
  \ What does all this mean? Are Christians in these northern states interested in
  <br>  upholding slavery? Are they unwilling to be convinced that their colored <br>
  \ brethren are better than the slanders of their oppressors would make them? Are
  <br>  they sure, beyond a doubt, that the colonization scheme will relieve our <br>
  \ country of the might evil which is crushing it? that it is the <br>  <em>Christian</em>
  \ way to relieve it? Are they on good evidence convinced that it is not <br>  <em>expedient</em>
  \ to say to the wicked, “O wicked man, thou shalt surely die?” Must they have <br>
  \ PEACE at any rate—peace, though the groans of millions should ascend and <br>
  \ mingle with the muttering thunders of coming wrath? Will they have it, that if
  <br>  a word is said against a mere experiment to test the practicability of <br>
  \ rescuing the victim by flattering the oppressor, the whole cause of Christian
  <br>  benevolence is attacked? If not, why not welcome inquiry? A thorough <br>
  \ investigation—a looking on <br>  <em>both sides,</em>  would surely do no harm.
  Those defenders of truth who have shunned such <br>  inquiry, have always proved
  themselves short-sighted. The cause of God courts <br>  scrutiny—its advocates are
  thrown into no unseemly agitation when they are <br>  most rigorously sifted. <br></p><p>
  \ The subject cries aloud for more earnest consideration than it has yet <br>  received.
  More than two millions of outraged, downtrodden men cry out, shall <br>  we die
  in this sore bondage that white Christians may have the pleasure of <br>  attempting
  to shun God’s wrath without repenting of sin?—Half a million of <br>  free colored
  men cry out—America is our country—the land for which <br>  <em>our</em>  fathers
  bled as well as yours. Why will you seek to banish us? The wrongs of <br>  the poor
  Indian cry aloud, There is no safety in league with transgressors! <br>  The present
  political aspect of the South [cries out, that tyrants do not <br>  regard law!
  Six hundred millions of idolaters cry out to the American church, <br>  “Why pluckest
  thou the mote out of thy brother’s eye, and behold a beam is in <br>  thine own!”
  <br></p>"
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: 'It is meaningful that this important work was in the hands of the students
  at the Canterbury Female Academy. Elizur Wright''s pamphlet announces the transformative
  vision of the Abolitionist movement from its stirring first sentence: "The American
  revolution was incomplete."'
