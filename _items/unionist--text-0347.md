commentary: '<p>   This same William Hutchins, most likely, gave an address declaiming
  equality   of Blacks and whites to the Windham County Colonization Society on July
  4,   1834 – in notes in totality here&nbsp; “A Heathenish Doctor: Genuine   Colonization
  Doctrines!!”   <em>The Liberator</em>   9 May 1835 </p> <p>   [From the Brooklyn,
  Ct. Advertiser] –   <strong>this was from a speech given July 4, 1834</strong>   [WLG
  inserts the important footnote – “This is a wilful and flagrant   falsehood. The
  address was ably reviewed, at the time, in the columns of the   Brooklyn Unionist,
  by its intelligent editor, Mr. Burleigh, who challenged the   heathenish doctor
  to a public discussion.—ED. LIB.”] Dr. William Hutchins   (1804-1845) – Find a Grave
