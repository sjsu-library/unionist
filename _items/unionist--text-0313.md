transcription: "<p>COMMUNICATIONS.</p> <p>For the Unionist.</p> <p> MR. EDITOR—Old
  Plainfield is “redeemed, regenerated and disenthralled” from the degrading bondage
  of Jacksonism. “We have met the enemy and they are ours.” Last year we gave a majority
  for Pearl as Senator, and had besides the honor and felicity of being represented
  in the Assembly by one thorough-going, avowed Jacksonman and one who though not
  nominally a Jacksonian is said to have always acted with that party, with as much
  fidelity as if he had been one of them. Now you know, Mr. Editor, this shows a laudable
  contempt of party trannels, for certainly no one ought to refuse his support to
  good measures, merely because they are the measures of the opposite party, and if
  the measures of the opposite party happen to be <em>all</em> right, why, they ought
  <em>all</em> to be supported—and yet, you know, it would hardly be right even in
  that case for a man to <em>desert</em> his own party. So we suppose our representative
  thought; but I did not sit down to tell you about last year, any more than just
  enough to give you a better idea of what we did this. Considerable activity was
  displayed by both sides in the electioneering campaign before hand. The Jackson
  recruiting sergeants were flying about with great spirit, sensible, doubtless, that
  their case being desperate required a desperate effort. And you may depend upon
  it, our friends did not look on and see all the bustle of the Heroites with folded
  hands and half closed eyes. They were awake and warning the honest people of the
  tricks and maneuvres of the self-styled democratic party, and the people needed
  only a word of caution to put them on their guard. The Jackson leaders, after beating
  up for recruits, and counting noses all about town, came to the conclusion, it seems,
  (and a pretty correct conclusion it was too,) that if they attempted to run a full-blooded,
  acknowledged worshipper of their idol, they should only run their head against a
  post, at the very first push; so making up their minds that policy (not that which
  the old proverb calls “the best policy” neither, for of that our Jackson leaders
  would be forced to say as David did of the armor with which Saul girded him, “I
  have not assayed it,”) must supply the place of strength, they pitched upon a worthy
  man whose temper and disposition they considered such that they could mould him
  to about the right shape when elected, but who has never been called a Jackson man,
  and whom, in fact, they took care themselves to represent as no Jackson man, and
  him they resolved to run for their first candidate. To make the trick work the better,
  they took some pains to create an impression among the genuine republicans that
  this gentleman was to be one of the candidates of the republican party, hoping no
  doubt thereby to divide our ranks, and by uniting all the Jackson strength with
  a part of ours, to defeat our regular ticket, and thus dishearten us, and run with
  increased strength for their second candidate, who we shrewdly guessed would be
  the Chief Judge of our County Court—the same who was sent from our town last year.
  But though the plan was cunningly formed, and all preliminary measures taken with
  admirable skill, still somehow it wouldn’t work. Though some of the republicans—not
  aware probably of the plot—voted with the Jacksonians, yet the greater part were
  too wide awake to be managed in that sort, as the vote declared. For the first representative
  287 votes were cast, of which Mr Goff, our candidate, received 157, Mr. Cady, the
  <em>not Jackson</em> candidate of the Jackson party, 74, Judge Eaton 2 or 3, and
  two of three others one apiece.</p> <p> This result was a damper, and as a natural
  consequence led them to relinquish the first order of battle, and instead of risking
  the Judge, to try their former candidate again; but some of the subalterns not getting
  their cue soon enough, had begun with commendable zeal to distribute votes for Mr.
  Eaton and had gone at least far enough to satisfy us what the original plan was,
  before they were stopped by the higher authorities. Not that the superior officers
  were at all negligent or remiss in checking the well meant, but ill judged activity
  of their less prudent partizans as soon as they discovered what was going on, for
  I chanced to see one of them, an <em>illustrious</em> member of the bar, as well
  as sharer in some small degree of the “spoils” of former campaigns, stepping about
  quite nimbly and giving the necessary orders to restore, as far as possible, that
  union which they had like to have lost by their own maneuvres. The result of the
  over forward promptitude of the subalterns appeared on counting the votes for a
  second representative, when it was found that 238 had been case—153 for Mr. Knight,
  our candidate, —62 for Mr. Cady, and some dozen or twenty or such a matter for Mr.
  Eaton. </p> <p> The votes for Senator, Governor &amp;c. exhibited a still more cheering
  result, but as you will probably insert them at length, I shall add nothing respecting
  them, except that I was pleased to see how the freeman stood at their posts instead
  of quitting as they too often do, immediately on the choice of representatives.
  This appears from the number of votes given for each officer. First Representative
  237, second do. 233, Senator 235, Governor 237. I have already told you how the
  Jacksonites carried matters last year, and I will add that by referring to the Presidential
  vote in 1832, I find that Jacksonism has sustained a net loss in this town since
  that time, of about 60 votes. </p> <p> (<em>signed</em>) PLAINFIELD REPUBLICAN </p> "
