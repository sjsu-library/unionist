transcription: "<p>O! SHAME! SHAME!!”</p> <p> ☞ “The following paragraph is   extracted
  from the Unionist of last week”  </p> <p>   “’The laudable efforts of the Canterbury
  worthies to drive Miss Crandall from   her purpose, by withholding from her the
  necessaries of life, will have the   effect to perpetuate their own well earned
  fame, if not to attain its primary   object. The latest measure which we have heard
  of their adopting, is the   FILLING MISS C’S WELL WITH MANURE FROM THE BARNYARD,
  \  <em>and then refusing to give her water from their own wells.’”</em> </p> "
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: The vigilante violence and harassment of the Canterbury Female Academy
  was continuous, malicious, and often crudely immature, as in this instance. Putting
  dung into drinking water can be life-threatening, and coupled with the white villagers'
  unwillingness to assist the Academy by delivering fresh water, this incident revealed
  the depth of inhuman disdain that the white villagers had.
