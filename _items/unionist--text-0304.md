transcription: "<p>LAST ILLNESS OF WM. WIRT.</p><p>  The Richmond Compiler of the
  17<sup>th</sup>  ult. contains an affecting account of the last illness of Mr. Wirt,
  written by <br>  a gentleman who attended him through that illness. We proceed to
  extract the <br>  principal part of it.— <br>  <em>Free Elector</em></p><p>  “On
  the evening of Saturday, the 8<sup>th</sup>  instant, he was in playful spirits,
  and sanguine of the success of an argument <br>  which he was to make in court on
  Monday. He felt better satisfied with his <br>  preparation, he said, than for any
  he had made for years before. On Sunday he <br>  walked to the Capitol to Church—it
  was a damp, chilly day, and the <br>  Representatives’ Hall was crowded and warm.
  To go immediately from it into the <br>  cold, damp air, and walk slowly, as he
  did, a mile to his lodgings, might have <br>  been deemed imprudent in one whose
  health was less precarious than his then <br>  seemed. <br></p><p>  ”That night
  he complained of a slight indisposition, and in the family worship <br>  of the
  evening prayed with an unusual fervor, and seemingly a foreboding <br>  spirit which
  he communicated not save to his God. But even this was sufficient <br>  to excite
  vague apprehensions in a family always ready to note and to dwell <br>  upon whatsoever
  might seem to bode danger or safety to a friend so dear. <br></p><p>  On Monday
  he was confined to his room; no serious apprehensions were <br>  entertained, but
  a physician was called in—it was only a cold. On Tuesday he <br>  was worse, but
  we feared not the result. He complained of stiffness of the <br>  muscles of the
  throat and swelling of the glands—milk poultices were applied <br>  to his face,
  but they gave not relief. On Wednesday he was much worse so much <br>  as to excite
  alarm; on the evening of this day it was first discovered that <br>  the disease
  was Erysipelas, ”a new enemy,” of which Mr. Wirt then expressed <br>  his fears.
  “It was not the foe with which he had been so long accustomed to <br>  contend.”
  <br></p><p>  His constitution was too weak, as the physicians apprehended, to stand
  the <br>  vigorous treatment which would have been most efficient in destroying
  the <br>  disease. By Friday, the alarm had become very serious—the door was crowded
  by <br>  anxious inquiring friends, and those who met in the street asked from each
  <br>  other the latest intelligence. The affliction of the family was extreme, but
  <br>  there was still hope. On Saturday, his daughter and son-in-law arrived from
  <br>  Baltimore, and were shocked to find the case so much worse than their worst
  <br>  fears. <br></p><p>  Scarcely a glimmer of hope was left to us, but this feeble
  ray was most <br>  anxiously watched and cherished. When once shadowed by so deep
  a gloom, the <br>  least of the twinkling stars in the firmament is more precious
  to our sight, <br>  than is the sun itself in the noontide of an unclouded day.
  <br></p><p>  Death from the first day of his illness, had continued to approach
  with a <br>  steady pace, and in a form more than usually hideous. The fine countenance
  so <br>  bright with intellect, was sadly altered—by the disease partly, and partly
  by <br>  remedies so fruitlessly applied. The eyes had lost their speculation—the
  <br>  eloquent voice was hushed—the divinity had departed from the temple, and its
  <br>  walls were defaced, but light still lingered, loath to abandon a habitation
  <br>  which had so long given to a thing in itself so little desirable and so <br>
  \ worthless, beauty, purity, and worth. <br></p><p>  The attending physicians were
  Doctors Hunt and Hall; none could have been more <br>  anxiously attentive; the
  latter staid by him every night of the last four or <br>  five. <br></p><p>  About
  noon on Monday, consciousness returned; and he had power to speak a few <br>  words.
  Nature had made a last effort to permit him to take leave of his family <br>  and
  friends, to give them assurance that he died in christian hope, and to <br>  join
  them in prayer to his God. The Rev. Mr. Post officiated. In so much of <br>  the
  prayer as related to his family and his own acceptance with heaven, he <br>  seemed
  heartily to join—but when a petition was offered that he might be <br>  restored
  to health, he audibly dissented “no, no!” He had done and suffered <br>  enough
  in this contentious world, and was entitled to the release and the <br>  transfer
  to a higher existence, which the good and just are authorized to <br>  expect. <br></p><p>
  \ It was now become manifest, even to the most sanguine, that recovery was <br>
  \ beyond the remotest probability. He was too shining a mark for death longer to
  <br>  miss. All that was left to us was to smooth his passage to the tomb—to moisten
  <br>  his parched lips and tongue, and perform such little offices of affection
  as <br>  might soothe his last sufferings. <br></p><p>  During the last eighteen
  hours, he was tranquil as a child. Breathing and <br>  warmth were the only evidence
  of life—no motion, no pain, no consciousness, <br>  there lay the wreck of WILLIAM
  WIRT. <br></p><p>  Three friends besides the clergymen attended his bedside during
  the night—his <br>  family to, worn as they were by nearly a week’s constant watching,
  could not <br>  be induced to take repose. Anguish and affection gave them strength
  to bear <br>  what would have exhausted the strongest men It was a night long to
  be <br>  remembered—a night of silent, despairing sorrow, which conveys to the heart
  a <br>  language never to be forgot, a language which is not for a pen like mine
  to <br>  transcribe. <br></p><p>  Tuesday morning breaks upon the scene still unaltered,
  save that life <br>  fluttered more faintly and all pulse was gone. About 11 o’clock
  the breathing <br>  became gradually more distant and more feeble—was suspended
  or <br>  imperceptible—another breath—he’s gone! So calm, so imperceptibly did he
  make <br>  his exit, that the precise moment of his departure could scarcely be
  <br>  marked—without a sign or a struggle his bright spirit has departed from <br>
  \ amongst us to a state o existence higher, mightier, and more glorious. <br></p><p>
  \ Upon a highly excited mind a slight incident will sometimes make a deep and <br>
  \ lasting impression. As the last flickerings of life were failing—while his <br>
  \ whole family, and the friends who had watched with them, were grouped around <br>
  \ his bed, and In silent, deep attention to the awful scene, all held their <br>
  \ breath, and their hearts and pulse stood still, a few soft, low notes from a <br>
  \ pet bird, which had before been so silent that its presence in the room was <br>
  \ unremarked, fell with startling sweetness on the ear. Only once before during
  <br>  his illness, had it been known to sing. On the preceding day,, at the <br>
  \ conclusion of the last act of devotion in which he ever joined, these same <br>
  \ soft notes had mingled with the solemn ‘Amen.’ <br></p><p></p>"
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: William Wirt (1772-1834) was a long-serving Attorney General of the United
  States, but is best-remembered today for defending the rights of the Cherokees in
  the case that later so sadly spiraled down into the Trail of Tears. Wirt was also
  the first Presidential candidate of the Anti-Masonic party, in 1832.
