transcription: "<p>LAST ILLNESS OF WM. WIRT.</p> <p>   The Richmond Compiler of the
  17   <sup>th</sup>   ult. contains an affecting account of the last illness of Mr.
  Wirt, written by   a gentleman who attended him through that illness. We proceed
  to extract the   principal part of it.—   <em>Free Elector</em> </p> <p>   “On the
  evening of Saturday, the 8   <sup>th</sup>   instant, he was in playful spirits,
  and sanguine of the success of an argument   which he was to make in court on Monday.
  He felt better satisfied with his   preparation, he said, than for any he had made
  for years before. On Sunday he   walked to the Capitol to Church—it was a damp,
  chilly day, and the   Representatives’ Hall was crowded and warm. To go immediately
  from it into the   cold, damp air, and walk slowly, as he did, a mile to his lodgings,
  might have   been deemed imprudent in one whose health was less precarious than
  his then   seemed. </p> <p>   ”That night he complained of a slight indisposition,
  and in the family worship   of the evening prayed with an unusual fervor, and seemingly
  a foreboding   spirit which he communicated not save to his God. But even this was
  sufficient   to excite vague apprehensions in a family always ready to note and
  to dwell   upon whatsoever might seem to bode danger or safety to a friend so dear.
  </p> <p>   On Monday he was confined to his room; no serious apprehensions were
  \  entertained, but a physician was called in—it was only a cold. On Tuesday he
  \  was worse, but we feared not the result. He complained of stiffness of the   muscles
  of the throat and swelling of the glands—milk poultices were applied   to his face,
  but they gave not relief. On Wednesday he was much worse so much   as to excite
  alarm; on the evening of this day it was first discovered that   the disease was
  Erysipelas, ”a new enemy,” of which Mr. Wirt then expressed   his fears. “It was
  not the foe with which he had been so long accustomed to   contend.” </p> <p>   His
  constitution was too weak, as the physicians apprehended, to stand the   vigorous
  treatment which would have been most efficient in destroying the   disease. By Friday,
  the alarm had become very serious—the door was crowded by   anxious inquiring friends,
  and those who met in the street asked from each   other the latest intelligence.
  The affliction of the family was extreme, but   there was still hope. On Saturday,
  his daughter and son-in-law arrived from   Baltimore, and were shocked to find the
  case so much worse than their worst   fears. </p> <p>   Scarcely a glimmer of hope
  was left to us, but this feeble ray was most   anxiously watched and cherished.
  When once shadowed by so deep a gloom, the   least of the twinkling stars in the
  firmament is more precious to our sight,   than is the sun itself in the noontide
  of an unclouded day. </p> <p>   Death from the first day of his illness, had continued
  to approach with a   steady pace, and in a form more than usually hideous. The fine
  countenance so   bright with intellect, was sadly altered—by the disease partly,
  and partly by   remedies so fruitlessly applied. The eyes had lost their speculation—the
  \  eloquent voice was hushed—the divinity had departed from the temple, and its
  \  walls were defaced, but light still lingered, loath to abandon a habitation   which
  had so long given to a thing in itself so little desirable and so   worthless, beauty,
  purity, and worth. </p> <p>   The attending physicians were Doctors Hunt and Hall;
  none could have been more   anxiously attentive; the latter staid by him every night
  of the last four or   five. </p> <p>   About noon on Monday, consciousness returned;
  and he had power to speak a few   words. Nature had made a last effort to permit
  him to take leave of his family   and friends, to give them assurance that he died
  in christian hope, and to   join them in prayer to his God. The Rev. Mr. Post officiated.
  In so much of   the prayer as related to his family and his own acceptance with
  heaven, he   seemed heartily to join—but when a petition was offered that he might
  be   restored to health, he audibly dissented “no, no!” He had done and suffered
  \  enough in this contentious world, and was entitled to the release and the   transfer
  to a higher existence, which the good and just are authorized to   expect. </p>
  <p>   It was now become manifest, even to the most sanguine, that recovery was   beyond
  the remotest probability. He was too shining a mark for death longer to   miss.
  All that was left to us was to smooth his passage to the tomb—to moisten   his parched
  lips and tongue, and perform such little offices of affection as   might soothe
  his last sufferings. </p> <p>   During the last eighteen hours, he was tranquil
  as a child. Breathing and   warmth were the only evidence of life—no motion, no
  pain, no consciousness,   there lay the wreck of WILLIAM WIRT. </p> <p>   Three
  friends besides the clergymen attended his bedside during the night—his   family
  to, worn as they were by nearly a week’s constant watching, could not   be induced
  to take repose. Anguish and affection gave them strength to bear   what would have
  exhausted the strongest men It was a night long to be   remembered—a night of silent,
  despairing sorrow, which conveys to the heart a   language never to be forgot, a
  language which is not for a pen like mine to   transcribe. </p> <p>   Tuesday morning
  breaks upon the scene still unaltered, save that life   fluttered more faintly and
  all pulse was gone. About 11 o’clock the breathing   became gradually more distant
  and more feeble—was suspended or   imperceptible—another breath—he’s gone! So calm,
  so imperceptibly did he make   his exit, that the precise moment of his departure
  could scarcely be   marked—without a sign or a struggle his bright spirit has departed
  from   amongst us to a state o existence higher, mightier, and more glorious. </p>
  <p>   Upon a highly excited mind a slight incident will sometimes make a deep and
  \  lasting impression. As the last flickerings of life were failing—while his   whole
  family, and the friends who had watched with them, were grouped around   his bed,
  and In silent, deep attention to the awful scene, all held their   breath, and their
  hearts and pulse stood still, a few soft, low notes from a   pet bird, which had
  before been so silent that its presence in the room was   unremarked, fell with
  startling sweetness on the ear. Only once before during   his illness, had it been
  known to sing. On the preceding day,, at the   conclusion of the last act of devotion
  in which he ever joined, these same   soft notes had mingled with the solemn ‘Amen.’

scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: William Wirt (1772-1834) was a long-serving Attorney General of the United
  States, but is best-remembered today for defending the rights of the Cherokees in
  the case that later so sadly spiraled down into the Trail of Tears. Wirt was also
  the first Presidential candidate of the Anti-Masonic party, in 1832.
