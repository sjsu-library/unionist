caption: 'Silk broadside of the Declaration of Sentiments, printed in Philadelphia
  in 1833. The text below the lithograph reads "Thou shalt tread upon the lion and
  the adder; the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet" (Psalm 91:13).
  The engraving is credited to R.S. Gilbert. Reuben Gilbert (1808-1849) was an important
  Philadelphia-based engraver who also supplied a famous engraving of the ruins of
  Pennsylvania Hall (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_Hall_%28Philadelphia%29#/media/File:Pennsylvania_Hall_after_fire.jpg
  ). He died young, though well-published. There is a Find-a-Grave memorial for him;
  ironically, it does not appear that his stone was well-engraved. https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/104231115/reuben-s-gilbert?_gl=1*effs81*_ga*MTUyMjQxNDg5NS4xNjU5NTYyOTE2*_ga_4QT8FMEX30*NDI0Njk2OGEtZmM3ZS00YjkyLWI1YzItMWY0MzM5ZGU3N2ZkLjcuMS4xNjc5MDAxNjA3LjMyLjAuMA. '
