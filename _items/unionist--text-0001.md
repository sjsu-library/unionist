transcription: <p><em>From the (Brooklyn) Unionist, August 29</em></p><p>  The last
  Advertiser declares that the story of the exclusion of Miss<br>  Crandall’s scholars
  from the meeting house “is wholly false.” We expressed<br>  surprise at a declaration
  so unqualified, and whether we had not some cause to<br>  do so, we leave our readers
  to decide, after they have read the following<br>  correspondence and the statement
  subjoined to it.<br></p><p>  We say nothing of the feelings which must have dictated
  such a course, except<br>  that we envy not their possessor. We wish merely to put
  on&nbsp; record the<br>  simple fact, that Miss Crandall’s pupils cannot attend
  public worship on the<br>  sabbath, in the only church within three miles of Miss
  C’s residence, without<br>  being called in question for so doing,—nay more—that
  they are virtually<br>  excluded from that place of worship, though some of them
  it is said are<br>  members of the church which regularly assembles there for public
  worship. And<br>  this is a land professedly Christian, in a State which boasts
  of its<br>  benevolent efforts to diffuse the blessings of the gospel among the
  distant<br>  heathen.”<br></p><p align="center">——</p><p align="center">To Miss
  PRUDENCE CRANDALL.</p><p>  When the committee visited you last February, stating
  their objections to your<br>  school, they understood from you, by your voluntary
  suggestion, that you<br>  should never desire, and never would put your coloured
  scholars into the<br>  meeting house — that you could have preaching at your own
  house, either black<br>  or white, and you also added, that the citizens of Canterbury
  need have no<br>  anxiety on that account, they might be assured, no such request
  would ever be<br>  made.<br></p><p>  It appears now, that you have departed from
  this voluntary declaration and put<br>  your colored scholars into pews ever occupied
  by the white females of the<br>  parish. We ask you to inform us soon, by whose
  license, you have thus taken<br>  possession of that part of the meeting house.&nbsp;

  inform Dr. Harris to-day.</p><p align="center">——</p><p align="right">  <em>Canterbury,
  July</em>  29, 1833.<br></p><p>TO SOLOMON PAYNE, ANDREW HARRIS, and ISAAC KNIGHT,</p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;
  Gentlemen—I received a letter from you on the 27<br>  <sup>th</sup>  in which you
  asked me to inform you soon by whose licence I have taken<br>  possession of that
  part of the meeting house that was occupied by my colored<br>  scholars on the sabbath
  previous.<br></p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp; I can inform you that the authority, whether
  lawful or unlawful,<br>  by which I permitted my family to enter the gallery of
  your church, was<br>  permission received from two of the Society’s committee, viz.
  Dr. Harris and<br>  Deacon Bacon.<br></p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp; On Saturday the 6<br>  <sup>th</sup>  of
  this month I sent a verbal request by Samuel L. Hough to the gentlemen whom<br>  I
  address, asking your permission to attend Divine worship with you on the<br>  sabbath.
  I asked Captain Hough to inform you that I would purchase seats<br>  sufficient
  for my scholars if agreeable to you, if not, any part or portion of<br>  the meeting
  house you might see fit for us to occupy, would be acceptable. Of<br>  this Mr.
  Hough said he informed you. Dr. Harris, in answer, said we might<br>  occupy the
  seat in the gallery appropriated to colored persons. Mr. Hough then<br>  remarked
  that the seat would not be sufficient for the scholars—Deacon Bacon<br>  then replied,
  that we might take the next pews until we had enough to be<br>  seated.<br></p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;
  Truly I said to the Committee that visited me in February<br>  last—The scholars
  who come here shall not trouble you on the Sabbath, for we<br>  can have preaching,
  either by colored or white ministers in our own house. The<br>  committee made me
  no reply at the time if I am not mistaken, and I think I am<br>  not.<br></p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;
  Upon mature consideration (as regular preaching here was not very<br>  readily obtained)
  I considered that I had done entirely wrong in depriving my<br>  scholars of the
  privilege of attending religious worship in this village.<br></p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;
  These are my reasons for asking the privilege of entering your<br>  church; and
  all the licence I have received is as given above.<br></p><p align="center">  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yours<br>  with
  respect,<br></p><p>P. CRANDALL.</p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp; Shortly after the above answer
  was sent by Miss Crandall to the<br>  foregoing communication, she received a verbal
  message, by Samuel L. Hough, Esq. from<br>  SOLOMON PAYNE, Esq. directing her not
  to go into the meeting house again with<br>  her pupils. For the truth of this last
  statement we rely upon the declaration<br>  of Samuel L. Hough, Esq.<br></p>
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: 'Church attendance, and church membership, were valorized cultural norms.
  Church seating was institutionalized as a marker of white supremacy, with African-Americans
  most often being limited to seats in the balcony. In fact, this very issue had led
  to the walkout by Black leaders Richard Allen and Absalom Jones from St. George''s
  Methodist Church in Philadelphia that launched the northern Black independent chuch
  movement (see http://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/pds/maai/community/text3/allenmethodism.pdf
  ).  Therefore this particular battle in Canterbury carried great emotional and strategic
  weight. For those reading about this controversy in the press - including The Unionist
  - the idea of denying the students access to attending church created an informal
  litmus test: spiritual equality before God (favoring the students) or preserving
  caste privilege in the key social institution that was the Congregational Church
  in Connecticut.'
