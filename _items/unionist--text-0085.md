  <p>
    How little do we appreciate a motherâ€™s tenderness while living! How heedless
    we are in youth of all her anxieties and kindness. But when she is dead and
    gone; when the cares and coldness of the world come withering to our hearts;
    when we find how hard it is to find true sympathy, how few love us for
    ourselves, how few will befriend us in our misfortunes; then it is we think of
    the mother we have lost.
  </p>

scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: While it would be easy to dismiss this as pious filler, it is a fact that
  Charles C. Burleigh ensured that his mother Lydia Bradford Burleigh would have a
  full obituary in <em>The Liberator</em>.
