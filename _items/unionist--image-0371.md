caption: Sarah Harris Fayerweather (1812-1878) was the African-American woman who
  first asked Crandall if she could attend the Academy, in 1832. She remained as the
  only holdover student from the first to the second version of the Canterbury Female
  Academy. She remained active in the Abolitionist movement, and visited Crandall
  in Kansas when they were both elderly.
