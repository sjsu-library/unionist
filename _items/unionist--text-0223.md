transcription: '<p>THE LIFE AND WRITINGS OF MAJOR JACK DOWNING,</p> <p> OF Downingville,
  away down east, in the state of Maine. Written by himself. </p> <p>“What makes all
  doctrines plain and clear?</p> <p>About two hundred pounds a year.</p> <p>And that
  which was proved true before,</p> <p>Prove false again? Two hundred more.”</p> <p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  HUDIBRAS </p> <p> Entered according to act of Congress, in the year 1833, by Lilly,
  Wait, and Co. Boston, n the Clerk’s Office of the District Court of Massachusetts.
  </p> <p> The following is from the MAJOR himself, and will show that he is satisfied
  the work is done correctly:— </p> <p align="right"> <em>Boston, Nov.</em> 6, 1833
  </p> <p> To the Editor of the Portland Courier, in the Mariners’ Church building,
  second story, eastern end, Fore street, Portland, away down east, in the state of
  Maine. </p> <p> My dear old friend, I wish you would give notice to all the folks,
  from Madawaska clear to South Carolina, nullifiers and all, that I’ve got my book
  done at last, and it’s ready for ‘em at Lilly, Wait, Colman &amp; Holden’s Bookstore,
  121, Washington street, Boston. You may tell ‘em I come clear on from Washington,
  purpose to ‘t was done well; and you may tell ‘em too, if you are a mind to, that
  you come up from Portland to help about it. And I guess when they find that we put
  our heads together about it, they wont [sic] be afraid but what it’s done right.
  I got some of the best picter [sic] makers there is in Boston to make some picters
  [sic] for it. And they’ve put in a picter of me, and one of General Jackson, and
  a few more of us, and some queer notions besides. On the whole I think it’s about
  the prettiest book I;ve seen this many a day. It beats President Jackson’s and Mr.
  Clay’s all hollow. They showed me a cute pretty book, that they called the Token,
  they said was about the prettiest thing in the book way they had in Boston, and
  I don’t know but the kiver is rather prettier than mine, but as for the picters
  and the reading, I say give me mine for all that. </p> <p>So I remain your loving
  friend,</p> <p>MAJOR JACK DOWNING</p> '
