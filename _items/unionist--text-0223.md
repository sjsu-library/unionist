transcription: <p>THE LIFE AND WRITINGS OF MAJOR JACK DOWNING,</p><p>  OF Downingville,
  away down east, in the state of Maine. Written by himself. <br></p><p>“What makes
  all doctrines plain and clear?</p><p>About two hundred pounds a year.</p><p>And
  that which was proved true before,</p><p>Prove false again? Two hundred more.”</p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <br>  HUDIBRAS— not at all sure about this <br></p><p>  Entered according to act
  of Congress, in the year 1833, by Lilly, wait, and <br>  Co. Boston, n the Clerk’s
  Office of the District Court of Massachusetts. <br></p><p>  The following is from
  the MAJOR himself, and will show that he is satisfied <br>  the work is done correctly:—
  <br></p><p align="right">  <em>Boston, Nov.</em>  6, 1833 <br></p><p>  To the Editor
  of the Portland Courier, in the Mariners’ Church building, <br>  second story, eastern
  end, Fore street, Portland, away down east, in the state <br>  of Maine. <br></p><p>  My
  dear old friend, I wish you would give notice to all the folks, from <br>  Madawaska
  clear to South Carolina, nullifiers and all, that I’ve got my book <br>  done at
  last, and it’s ready for ‘em at Lilly, Wait, Colman &amp; Holden’s <br>  Bookstore,
  121, Washington street, Boston. You may tell ‘em I come clear on <br>  from Washington,
  purpose to ‘t was done well; and you may tell ‘em too, if you <br>  are a mind to,
  that you come up from Portland to help about it. And I guess <br>  when they find
  that we put our heads together about it, they wont [sic] be <br>  afraid but what
  it’s done right. I got some of the best picter [sic] makers <br>  there is in Boston
  to make some picters [sic] for it. And they’ve put in a <br>  picter of me, and
  one of General Jackson, and a few more of us, and some queer <br>  notions besides.
  On the whole I think it’s about the prettiest book I;ve seen <br>  this many a day.
  It beats President Jackson’s and Mr. Clay’s all hollow. They <br>  showed me a cute
  pretty book, that they called the Token, they said was about <br>  the prettiest
  thing in the bok way they had in Boston, and I don’t know but <br>  the kiver is
  rather prettier than mine, but as for the picters and the <br>  reading, I say give
  me mine for all that. <br></p><p>So I remain your loving friend,</p><p>MAJOR JACK
  DOWNING</p>
