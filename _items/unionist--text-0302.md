  for the Unionist.]</p><p>  TRIAL OF FREDERIC OLNEY. (<br>  <em>Concluded.</em>  )<br></p><p>
  \ <em>Windham County Court</em>  ss.<br>  <em>March Term,</em>  1834.<br></p><p>Present,
  Hon. Judges Eaton, Griffin and Chase.</p><p>State vs. Frederic Olney</p><p>  <em>Mary
  Burleigh.</em>  —This witness stated the same general facts as before stated, and
  added that<br>  when she came down into the keeping room, before dinner, she perceived
  a bad<br>  smell—that after dinner, she returned to the keeping room, perceived
  a little<br>  smoke in the room, where the rays of the sun were, and the smell was
  so<br>  disagreeable that she took the paper which she was reading, and went up
  stairs<br>  <em>(sic)</em>  to the school room. On her cross examination, being
  asked if she named the<br>  subject of the smell at the time; did the evening after,
  to Miss P. Crandall<br>  and others; heard Olney say after the alarm was over, that
  if it had not been<br>  for the fire, he should have been gone, or away in a few
  moments.<br></p><p>  <em>Maria Harris</em>  testified that Olney came to the kitchen
  from the keeping room soon after his<br>  arrival and asked if he could not have
  some breakfast; that he came from home<br>  early and had not eaten any; witness
  asked Charles to bring some biscuit from<br>  the closet; After Olney had eaten
  he went back to the keeping room; then came<br>  back, and staid till dinner time;
  did not go out of doors, only went to the<br>  cellar kitchen; Olney ate dinner
  and staid some time in the kitchen<br>  afterwards; witness had just got ready to
  wash her spoons &amp;c. as Olney<br>  left the kitchen to go to the keeping-room;
  she had not washed any as she<br>  recollects when she heard the cry of fire; it
  was possibly five minutes after<br>  Olney left the kitchen when she heard the cry.<br></p><p>
  \ <em>Cross-Examined.</em>  Olney took his loose coat when he left the kitchen and
  said he was going to<br>  bid Miss Crandall good bye, or that he was going to see
  her a few moments and<br>  must then go to Brooklyn; do not know whether he put
  his coat on or not; don’t<br>  remember seeing him put it on.<br></p><p>  <em>Betsey
  Fish</em>  was in the cellar kitchen when Olney came down first; he staid perhaps
  fifteen<br>  minutes; did not go out of doors but returned up stairs; left Olney
  at dinner<br>  when she finished.<br></p><p>  <em>Charles Harris</em>  (testified
  to preliminary facts same as others.) Saw Olney in the keeping room<br>  writing
  before dinner and not long afterwards h brought witness a letter and<br>  asked
  him to carry it to the post-office; witness carried it when they were at<br>  dinner;
  after dinner Olney said he was going to Brooklyn, that he would go and<br>  bid
  Miss Crandall good bye before he started; this was in the kitchen; very<br>  soon
  he heard fire cried; ran out and saw smoke at the corner of the house;<br>  got
  an axe and Olney struck into the corner and the smoke burst out; witness<br>  then
  went and rang the bell and people immediately came; he took up the carpet<br>  in
  the keeping room after he got back; it was nailed down round the edge at<br>  the
  corner and elsewhere; it was snug and tight and filled up the crack; it<br>  was
  nearly new, thick, and bound around the edge; has examined it to see if it<br>  was
  singed and found it was not; no scorch on it or on the mop-board; Olney<br>  struck
  the mouldings on the east side of the corner at first, but could not<br>  start
  them; he then struck on the north side and the smoke came right out; the<br>  letter
  which witness carried to the post-office was directed to a ____<br>  Marshall; don’t
  remember the first name.<br></p><p>  <em>Cross examined.</em>  Delivered the letter
  at the office when they were eating dinner at Miss<br>  Crandall’s; said nothing
  about this before the Justice’s Court; don’t now<br>  remember whether he then said
  that he went but once out of the kitchen and<br>  that was to carry wood to the
  fire; thinks he was not out but this time that<br>  he speaks of; don't remember
  having been at Jenk’s store about noon; did not<br>  go there from the post-office
  but went directly home; don’t remember having a<br>  conversation with two persons
  at Col. Judson’s corner when he went to the<br>  post-office; when Olney left the
  kitchen he said he would bid Miss Crandall<br>  good bye and start for Brooklyn;
  saw clapboards cut off when he came back from<br>  ringing the bell;<br></p><p><em>Note
  to self: were they trying to frame Charles, too?</em></p><p>  <em>Elizabeth Marshall</em>
  \ resides in the city of New York; on the 23d or 24<sup>th</sup>  of January last
  Olney left New York and took a letter, and bundle &amp;c. to<br>  her little daughter
  at Miss Crandall’s school at Canterbury; witness had<br>  before sent a bundle to
  her daughter which had miscarried in October last;<br>  Olney said he would write
  to witness as soon as he got to Canterbury and tell<br>  her whether he had found
  it or not and also tell her about her daughter; the<br>  Saturday night of the week
  following Olney’s departure from New York, when<br>  witness returned home from
  her work, her eldest daughter told her that she had<br>  got a letter from Olney,
  and read it to her. (witness not being able to read);<br>  [The witness here produced
  a half sheet of letter paper written over, which he<br>  said was the letter paper
  written over, which he said was the letter read to<br>  her by her daughter; it
  was dated Canterbury January 28<sup>th</sup>  1834, and purported to be a letter
  from Frederic Olney to Mrs. Marshall; the<br>  other half of the sheet, which was
  the one containing the direction and post<br>  mark witness said she had used to
  light her lamp one morning, soon after<br>  receiving the letter, having risen before
  it was light.]<br></p><p>  <em>    Note to self: Olney’s name was misspelt once
  as Onley; note also that there<br>    seems to be some gender confusion about the
  witness in here<br>  </em></p><p>  <em>Mary Jane Benson.</em>  After dinner at Miss
  Crandall’s on the day of the fire, witness went from the<br>  dinner table in the
  kitchen to the keeping room in company with Miss Willis<br>  and others; soon after
  entering the keeping room Miss Willis asked, what<br>  smells so? witness replies
  that it was like old chestnut wood burning; Olney<br>  was at this time eating his
  dinner in the kitchen; witness went from the<br>  keeping room into the space and
  fro thence she thinks she went to the school<br>  room; don’t recollect seeing any
  smoke.<br></p><p>  <em>Cross examined.</em>  The conversation about the smell was
  after dinner, as soon as she had done;<br>  don't remember whether any one was in
  the keeping room when they came to it;<br>  those with witness were Miss Willis
  and Miss De Grasse, &amp;c.; don’t<br>  remember that any but Miss Willis asked
  as to the smell: had no particular<br>  business in the room, and did not remain
  in it more than two or three minutes;<br>  do not recollect whether she had spoken
  to any one of this but Mr. Tyler;<br>  “don’t remember how the conversation was
  then introduced; don’t recollect that<br>  Mr. Tyler said to her that other girls
  had stated a similar story.<br></p><p>[The defendant’s counsel here rested their
  testimony.]</p><p>The counsel for the prosecution then called</p><p>  <em>Charles
  Harris,</em>  who being asked, if Olney had not been requested by Miss Crandall
  not to visit<br>  at her house, said not to his knowledge, witness has never said
  so.<br></p><p>  <em>William Kinne</em>  was called by Miss Crandall to examine her
  house after the burning, and did<br>  so; has looked at it twice; if the fire was
  introduced under the mop-board it<br>  would have gone to the place where the most
  burning was; for this reason<br>  thinks the fire was set from the inside; the inside
  of the sheathing board was<br>  burned most; thinks the fire began on the sill.<br></p><p>
  \ <em>Cross-examined</em>  Did not ascertain whether the bottom of the sill was
  burnt or not; the line<br>  was discolored in some places, in others not; he differed
  from the majority o<br>  those who examined with him as to the origin of the fire.<br></p><p>
  \ <em>George Middleton</em>  examined the house with the committee from the Insurance
  Company; concurs<br>  generally in their statements and thinks the fire caught from
  within.<br></p><p>  <em>Andrew Harris.</em>  (Large fragments of the house were
  brought into court, which were put together<br>  by Dr. Harris, who explained at
  length their situation and appearance; Dr<br>  Harris was not present at the fire
  but examined the house carefully at<br>  different times afterwards. Being asked
  his opinion as to the origin of the<br>  fire, he answered that he had not been
  willing to form an opinion on the<br>  subject, and did not think the question could
  be answered except by<br>  probabilities.<br></p><p>  <em>Mary Harris</em>  was
  at her father’s when the stage stopped at Miss Crandall’s; saw the driver<br>  get
  down and take off bundles; a man alighted and stood on the east side of<br>  the
  horses; tried to ascertain if he was Olney; the man with the driver got<br>  down;
  the driver stood on the box a part of the time; he stepped down to take<br>  the
  reins from Olney and then returned to his place.<br></p><p>  <em>Mrs. A. T. Judson</em>
  \ saw the stage stop at Miss Crandall’s; the driver left his box and gave the<br>
  \ reins to Olney; did not at this time know Olney; saw him afterwards; a woman<br>
  \ got into the stage from Miss Crandall’s; did not see Olney get out; witness<br>
  \ left her window before the stage started; the driver carried in one box.<br></p><p>
  \ <em>George S. White</em>  was now called by defendants counsel to explain the
  appearance of some parts<br>  of the timber shown by Dr. Harris; not remembering
  in relation to them.<br></p><p>  <em>Albert Hinckley</em>  was again called, and
  gave the explanations.<br></p><p>  <em>Elkanah C. Eaton.</em>  was again called
  by the counsel for the prosecution, and stated that when he<br>  examined the house,
  the sill was firm upon the mortar; the outer edge was<br>  burnt nearly to the bottom;
  that he assisted in putting the timber together as<br>  they were before the fire,
  and there was no chance of any communication from<br>  without except where the
  pointing was out; expressed an opinion as before that<br>  the fire caught from
  within.<br></p><p>  <em>Betsey Fish</em>  was again called by defendant’s counsel,
  and she stated that she brought the<br>  first pail of water; that it was turned
  in at the corner below, while Olney<br>  was cutting a hole to come at the fire.<br></p><p>
  \ The testimony being closed on both sides, A.T. Judson Esq. opened on the part<br>
  \ of the prosecution, D.P. Tyler Esq. opened on the part of the prisoner and was<br>
  \ followed by the Hon. Calvin Goddard on the same side; C.F. Cleveland Esq.<br>
  \ closed for the prosecution.—It seemed to be tacitly admitted that the fire was<br>
  \ caused by design. The counsel for the prosecution claimed that the fire was<br>
  \ communicated from within and that it was done by Olney. The opposing counsel<br>
  \ insisted that the balance of proof was that the fire was communicated from<br>
  \ without, but whether from within or from without, no testimony whatever had<br>
  \ been adduced tending to show that Olney was guilty. The charge of his Honor<br>
  \ Judge EATON was brief, but distinguished for its ability and impartiality. The<br>
  \ jury retired, and after a short absence returned a verdict of<br>  <em>not guilty.</em></p><p>
  \ The trial occupied the court from 2 o’clock in the afternoon of Thursday, till<br>
  \ 6 o’clock P.M. on Saturday. F.<br></p><p></p>"
scholarlyNotes: Note that there is a missing Part Two. <em>  “F” identified elsewhere
  in the paper as Mr. Foster. Henry Foster was a Black<br>  leader in Hartford, and
  Stephen Foster was already familiar with WLG in the<br>  late 1820s. A quick Ancestry
  look reveals plenty of people from Windham county<br>  with that last name. No other
  references to other Fosters in the other<br></em>Unionists. Very unlikely to be
  Stephen Foster who was still in school at the<br>time, but not impossible.<br>
commentary: 'Another one of the most important gems within <em>The Unionist</em>.
  The key is the testimony of Elizabeth Marshall, who corroborates Frederick Olney''s
  reason to be at the school that day '
