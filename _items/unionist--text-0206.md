transcription: "<p>TO THE MEMORY OF CHARLES B. STORRS,</p><p><em>Late President of
  Western Reserve College.</em></p><p>BY JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER.</p><p>  ‘He fell
  a martyr to the interests of his<br>  <em>colored brethren.</em>  For many months
  did that might man of God apply his discriminating and<br>  gigantic mind to the
  subject of Slavery and its Remedy; and, when his sould<br>  cou’d no longer contain
  his holy indignation against the upholders and<br>  apologists of this unrighteous
  system, he gave vent to his aching heart, and<br>  poured forth his clear throughs
  and holy feelings in such deep and<br>  soul-entrancing eloquence, that other men,
  who he would fain in his humble<br>  modesty acknowledge his superiors, sat at his
  feet and looked up as children<br>  to a parent.’—<br>  <em>Correspondent of the
  ‘Liberator,’ 16</em>  <em><sup>th</sup></em>  <em>of 11</em>  <em><sup>th</sup></em>
  \ <em>Mo.</em>  1833.<br></p><p>  Thou hast fallen in thine armor—<br>  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp;
  Thou martyr of the Lord!—<br>  <br />  With thy last breath crying—'Onward!'<br>
  \ <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp; And thy hand upon the sword.<br>  <br />  The haughty heart
  derideth,<br>  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp; And the sinful lip reviles,<br>  <br />  But
  the blessing of the perishing<br>  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp; Around thy pillow smiles!<br>
  \ <br />  <br />  When to our cup of trembling<br>  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp; The added
  drop is given—<br>  <br />  And the long-suspended thunder<br>  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp;
  Falls terribly from Heaven,—<br>  <br />  When a new and fearful freedom<br>  <br
  />  &nbsp;&nbsp; Is proffered of the Lord<br>  <br />  To the slow-consuming Famine—<br>
  \ <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp; The Pestilence and Sword!—<br>  <br />  <br />  When the
  refuges of Falsehood<br>  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp; Shall be swept away in wrath,<br>
  \ <br />  And the temple shall be shaken,<br>  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp; With its idol,
  to the earth, —<br>  <br />  Shall not thy words of warning<br>  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp;
  Be all remembered then?—<br>  <br />  And thy now unheeded message<br>  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp;
  Burn in the hearts of men? —<br>  <br />  <br />  Oppression's hand may scatter<br>
  \ <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp; Its nettles on thy tomb,<br>  <br />  And even Christian
  bosoms<br>  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp; Deny thy memory room;—<br>  <br />  For lying lips
  shall torture<br>  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp; Thy mercy into crime,<br>  <br />  And the
  slanderer shall flourish<br>  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp; As the bay-tree for a time.<br>
  \ <br />  <br />  But where the South-wind lingers<br>  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp; On
  Carolina's pines,—<br>  <br />  Or falls the careless sunbeam<br>  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp;
  Down Georgia's golden mines;—<br>  <br />  Where now beneath his burthen<br>  <br
  />  &nbsp;&nbsp; The toiling slave is driven;—<br>  <br />  Where now a tyrant's
  mockery<br>  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp; Is offered unto Heaven;—<br>  <br />  <br />  Where
  Mammon hath its altars<br>  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp; Wet o'er with human blood,<br>
  \ <br />  And pride and lust debases<br>  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp; The workmanship of
  God,—<br>  <br />  There shall thy praise be spoken,<br>  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp; Redeemed
  from Falsehood's ban,<br>  <br />  When the fetters shall be broken,<br>  <br />
  \ &nbsp;&nbsp; And the slave shall be a<br>  <em>man</em>  !<br>  <br />  <br />
  \ Joy to thy spirit, brother!—<br>  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp; A thousand hearts are warm,—<br>
  \ <br />  A thousand kindred bosoms<br>  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp; Are baring to the
  storm.<br>  <br />  What though red-handed Violence<br>  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp; With
  secret Fraud combine?<br>  <br />  The wall of fire is round us,—<br>  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp;
  Our Present Help was thine.<br>  <br />  <br />  Lo, the waking up of nations,<br>
  \ <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp; From Slavery's fatal sleep;—<br>  <br />  The murmur of a
  universe,—<br>  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp; Deep calling unto deep!—<br>  <br />  Joy to
  thy spirit, brother!—<br>  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp; On every wind of heaven<br>  <br
  />  The onward cheer and summons<br>  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp; OF FREEDOM’S SOUL is
  given!<br>  <br />  <br />  Glory to God forever!—<br>  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond
  the despot's will<br>  <br />  The soul of Freedom liveth<br>  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp;
  Imperishable still.<br>  <br />  The words which thou hast uttered<br>  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp;
  Are of that soul a part,<br>  <br />  And the good seed thou hast scattered<br>
  \ <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp; Is springing from the heart.<br>  <br />  <br />  In the
  evil days before us,<br>  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp; And the trials yet to come—<br>  <br
  />  In the shadow of the prison,<br>  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp; Or the cruel martyrdom—<br>
  \ <br />  We will think of thee, O Brother!<br>  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp; And thy sainted
  name shall be<br>  <br />  In the blessing of the captive,<br>  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp;
  And the anthem of the free.<br></p>"

commentary: 'Charles Backus Storrs (1794-1833) was the first President of Case-Western
  Reserve University in Cleveland. This poem can also be found on Poem Hunter: https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/to-the-memory-of-charles-b-storrs/
  . In addition to the poetic memorial from Whittier, there is this account from Henry
  Wilson of Storrs'' deathbed testimony: "Rev. Amos A. Phelps of Massachusetts earnestly
  supported the resolution. He referred in words of tender eulogy to the Rev. Charles
  B. Storrs, late president of the Western Reserve College, who had recently died
  at Braintree, Massachusetts. He stated that Mr. Storrs, while lying on his death-bed,
  requested that a pen should be placed in his hands, that he might affix his name
  to a declaration of antislavery principles about to be issued. "He commenced," said
  Mr. Phelps, “tracing his name, and had written the first word, ''Charles,'' when
  he discovered that two of the letters had been transposed. Letting the pen fall,
  and turning to his brother, standing by, he exclaimed, with an energy peculiar to
  him: ''I can write no more: Brother, do you finish my name. Those principles are
  eternal truth. They cannot be shaken. I wish to give to them my dying testimony.''"
  Mr. Phelps expressed the opinion that the death of President Storrs had been hastened
  by over-exertion in delivering an address of great vigor and power of more than
  two hours in length, in behalf of the slave. Mr. Storrs was a gentleman of high
  promise and scholarship, of Christian principle and earnest philanthropy, in whose
  untimely death freedom lost one of its earliest and ablest champions. The touching
  scene at his death-bed is one among the evidences that the antislavery struggle
  in this country was born of a zeal and heroic devotion to principle which finds
  not many parallels in the world''s history" (“National Antislavery Convention at
  Philadelphia: Organization of the American Antislavery Society,” by Henry Wilson,
  in <em>History of the Rise and Fall of the Slave Power in America</em>, 1872, accessed
