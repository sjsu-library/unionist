transcription: <p align="right"><em>From the New-York Com. Adv.</em></p> <p align="center">“THEY
  POURED THE RED LIBATION FORTH.”</p> <p>   They pour’d the   <em>red libation</em>   forth,
  </p> <p>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And
  fill’d   the golden bowl; </p> <p>I dash’d it on the famish’d earth,</p> <p>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  And spurn’d   its base control. </p> <p>And said—no more my peace shall be,</p>
  <p>A victim to thy treachery!</p> <p>   They wove of   <em>Fame</em>   the blooming
  wreath, </p> <p>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  My brow the   chaplet twined; </p> <p>My feet I trod the flowers beneath,</p> <p>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  And gave   them to the wind; </p> <p>And said, my heart no more shall trust</p>
  <p>To that which is itself but dust!</p>
