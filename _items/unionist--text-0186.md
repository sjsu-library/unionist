scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: Another important text that almost certainly found its way inside the
  Canterbury Female Academy. Rankin became one of the most fearless and successful
  conductors of self-liberated people fleeing enslavement, due to his location in
  Ohio just over the border from Kentucky. Rankin's <em>Letters</em> were admired
  by William Lloyd Garrison, and read by many Abollitionists in thie 1830s.
