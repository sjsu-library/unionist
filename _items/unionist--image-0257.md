caption: Arnold Buffum (1782-1859) wore many hats in the Abolitionist movement. One
  of Garrison's earliest allies, he held positions in many anti-slavery organizations.
  His famed Abolitionist daughter Elizabeth Buffum Chace (1806-1899) was a classmate
  of Prudence Crandall's at the New England Yearly Meeting Boarding Schools. Arnold
  Buffum was among the endorsers of the Canterbury Female Academy, and chosen by Prudence
  Crandall to represent her at the raucous Town Meeting of early March 1833.
