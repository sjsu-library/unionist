description: Benjamin Watkins Leigh (1781-1849) was appointed to an empty Senatorial
  seat from Virginia in 1834. During the hysteria over Abolitionist publications in
  1835, he famously said that Virginians had the right â€œto suppress to the utmost
  of our power what we deem inflammatory, dangerous, mischievous."
