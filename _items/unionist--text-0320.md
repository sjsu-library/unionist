transcription: "<p> <em>West India Education.</em> —Governments are, it is understood,
  adopting a plan for establishing and maintaining schools for the negroes and other
  inhabitants of our African, West-Indian, and other colonies. It appears that there
  are funds which were formerly provided for the redemption of Christians from slavery
  in Algiers, Morocco, and the other states of Barbary, which in consequence of the
  extinction of Christian slavery in those countries have accumulated to a considerable
  amount; and government now conceive that these funds may be applied to the education
  and mental liberation of the descendants of slaves. </p> <p> — <em>London Chr. Guar.</em>
  </p> "
scholarlyNotes: I could find no London, England newspaper named Christian Guardian,
  but there was an important one based out of Toronto
commentary: "<em>The Unionist</em> knows its readers are concerned with linkages between
  abolition and education, wherever in the world developments are occuring."
