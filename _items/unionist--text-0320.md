transcription: "<p>  <em>West India Education.</em>  —Governments are, it is understood,
  adopting a plan for establishing and<br>  maintaining schools for the negroes and
  other inhabitants of our African,<br>  West-Indian, and other colonies. It appears
  that there are funds which were<br>  formerly provided for the redemption of Christians
  from slavery in Algiers,<br>  Morocco, and the other states of Barbary, which in
  consequence of the<br>  extinction of Christian slavery in those countries have
  accumulated to a<br>  considerable amount; and government now conceive that these
  funds may be<br>  applied to the education and mental liberation of the descendants
  of slaves.<br></p><p>  —<br>  <em>London Chr. Guar.</em></p>"
scholarlyNotes: I could find no London, England newspaper named Christian Guardian,
  but there was an important one based out of Toronto
commentary: "<em>The Unionist</em> knows its readers are concerned with linkages between
  abolition and education, wherever in the world developments are occuring."
