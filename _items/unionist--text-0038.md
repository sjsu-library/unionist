transcription: <p align="center">THE QUESTION.</p><p><strong>Considerable pains are
  taken to keep the question respecting the Canterbury School from coming fairly before
  the public. The following extract from Mr. May’s letter to Andrew T. Judson, Esq.
  presents it in the true light.</strong></p><p>Nothing, I am confident, could have
  been further from Miss Crandall’s intention, than to do her neighbors any injury.
  And Sir, you may rest assured, the gentlemen referred to in her Advertisement would
  not uphold her a moment in violating any of your rights. The determination she has
  formed to devote herself to the education of colored females, we cannot but highly
  approve. Her residence in your village is altogether a providential circumstance.
  We should encourage her benevolent enterprise, wherever it might be undertaken.
  And if a suitable situation can be provided for her, in some place where her neighbors
  would assist and cheer her, or where they would only not molest her, we should rejoice
  to have her remove thither. But you declared, in the town meeting, that the school
  should not be located in any part of Canterbury—and also that there is not a town
  in the State which would admit such a seminary within its borders. It is therefore
  all the more necessary that she should be sustained where she now is. It is to be
  deeply regretted that yourself and others are opposed to her. We think you are doing
  yourselves no honor; and more than that, we are persuaded you are helping to perpetuate
  the great iniquity, and the deep disgrace of our country. The question between us
  is not simply whether thirty or forty colored girls shall be well educated at a
  school to be kept in Canterbury; but whether the people in any part of our land
  will recognize and generously protect the “inalienable rights of man,” without distinction
  of color? If this be not done, in Connecticut, where else in our land can we expect
  it will be done, at least in our day? That it cannot be done even in this State
  without a struggle, is not most shamefully obvious. A year or two since, some benevolent
  individuals proposed to erect an institution, at New Haven, for the education of
  colored young men. The design was defeated by violent opposition. If the citizens
  had opposed merely its location in that City, they might have escaped condemnation,
  for such a seminary there might have been very prejudicial to Yale College. But
  it was only too apparent, that their hostility to the institution was peculiarly
  embittered by their prejudices against the color of those, who were to be educated
  at it. So too in the case at Canterbury; no one pretends there would have been any
  opposition to Miss Crandall’s school, if her pupils were to be white. The tincture
  of their skin then it is which has called out the men of influence in array against
  her; and has even procured from the freemen of the town an expression of their “unqualified
  disapprobation” of her plan.</p><p>Here then, in Connecticut, we have had two recent
  instances of outrage committed upon “the inalienable rights of man.” Among these
  rights, to use the language of the Declaration of Independence “are life, liberty,
  and the pursuit of happiness.” Now Education has from the first, been regarded in
  this State highly conducive to private happiness, and the public weal. Yet have
  our colored brethren been twice angrily denied permission to seek this blessing,
  to the extent they have desired. Will the people of Connecticut generally, countenance
  these violation of our civil and religious principles? If they will, let them no
  longer claim to be a republican, much less a christian people!</p>
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: 'Samuel J. May (1797-1871) was the Unitarian minister of Brooklyn - the
  only Unitarian in the entire state of Connecticut at the time - and the best strategic
  thinker among Prudence Crandall''s local white allies. Here he names the problem
  quite precisely: "Education has from the first, been regarded in this State highly
  conducive to private happiness, and the public weal. Yet have our colored brethren
  been twice angrily denied permission to seek this blessing." The "twice angrily
  denied" refers to the New Haven Manual Labor College effort of 1831, while the second
  denial is the Black Law against the Canterbury Female Academy.'
