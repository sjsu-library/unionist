transcription: "<p>  “MISS CRANDALL’S SCHOOL. One of the children now in that school
  is the<br>  daughter of a poor woman in the city of New-York who obtains a living
  by her<br>  daily labor. Of course she is unable to give her children an education,
  and<br>  this child is<br>  <em>supported by another woman, who was once a slave,</em>
  \ and purchased her freedom by her own exertions. Another of Miss C’s scholars<br>
  \ is the daughter of a father who was himself a slave.<br></p><p>  Where can we
  find such thirsting for knowledge among our white<br>  population?—Where can we
  find a man, nay, where can we find a<br>  <em>woman</em>  who has risen from a state
  of the lowest degradation by her own unaided<br>  exertions, under the weight of
  all the prejudices which are crushing her in<br>  the dust, against the seemingly
  irresistible tide of public opinion which is<br>  ever setting against her—I say,
  where can we find a person with a white skin<br>  who has risen from such a situation,
  and<br>  <em>taught himself</em>  the real worth of man, the real dignity of the
  human mind, and the exalting,<br>  ennobling power of education, to such as extent
  that, although by no means in<br>  affluent circumstances, he is willing to spend
  a portion of his little all to<br>  support at school the child of an indigent neighbor?”<br></p><p></p>"
