transcription: '<p align="center">Parley’s Magazine</p> <p> The work was originally
  undertaken as an experiment to ascertain how far the public would encourage a magazine
  exclusively devoted to one object, viz. the intellectual instruction and moral improvement
  of the rising generation. In order to render the work extensively useful, a large
  circulation was necessary, and to ensure this, a very low price was indispensable.
  </p> <p> Every effort has been made to combine all these points in the Magazine,
  and we are happy to say that the success of our experiment thus far, is very encouraging.
  The circulation at present is nearly 15,000; a number entirely beyond that of any
  similar work ever undertaken in this country. But great as it is, such are the accumulated
  expenses of the publication, from the number of engravings, and from the care attending
  it, together with the very low price at which it is afforded, that we need a still
  more extended circulation to enable us fully to develope [sic] our plan, and bring
  into activity all the means of rendering the work still more efficient and useful.
  </p> <p> The idea of a state of society in which there shall not be an individual,
  either so ignorant, or so depraved, through the faults of education, as to be blind
  to his interests, and resist the great end of life, is perhaps a mere chimera, but
  if it is a point that cannot be reached, it may certainly be approached. But how
  is this to be done? By an union of heart and hand, among the good and wise, in giving
  the fullest possible activity and energy, to every instrument which leads to the
  desired end. </p> <p> Now, if in your opinion, this work is such an instrument,
  we suggest, as a means by which you may promote its usefulness, some further recommendation
  of it to the public attention, and in particular to that of teachers of [indecipherable
  – students? scholars?] and heads of families. The Work is issued every other week,
  or in quarterly Parts bound in strong cloth hacks [?? On last word] </p> <p> The
  price is one dollar a year—six copies will be sent to any one address for five dollars,
  or ten copies for eight dollars, as we are willing (that every family may be accommodated)
  to receive twenty-five subscribers for five. Dollars paid quarterly, remitted in
  advance to the publishers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: '"Samuel Goodrich (1793-1860) was born in Ridgefield, Connecticut, the
  6th of ten children and the son of a minister, in 1793. His career as a book publisher
  began in 1816. In the early 1820s Goodrich came to the conclusion that children
  as well as adults preferred to read truth rather than fancy and that it would be
  possible to present history, geography, science, etc. (truth) in such a way that
  it would be more interesting to children than fairies, giants and monsters. Based
  on this conclusion Goodrich moved his business to Boston and Peter Parley was born
  in 1827 with PETER PARLEY''S TALES ABOUT AMERICA. Goodrich expanded his publishing
  efforts to textbooks and magazines. His publications were so popular that he attracted
  imposters, particularly in England. Spurious Peter Parleys appeared everywhere,
  infuriating Goodrich, but he did not succeed in putting an end to them." from Contextual
