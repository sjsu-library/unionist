transcription: "<em>Character of the Dutch,</em> —It is well known that a habit prevails
  almost every where, of underrating and disparaging Dutch character and Dutchmen.
  Nothing is more unjust, and nothing is more common—nothing testifies more unequivocally
  the ignorance and prejudice of those who indulge in it, than the habit.—England
  is called the mother; but if such of our population, whose ancestors emigrated from
  her shores are proud of their origin, much more reason have they, who are descendants
  of the honest burgomasters of Holland, to be proud of theirs.—Holland, though occupying
  a territory not larger than the state of Maryland, was first among the nations of
  Europe to take a stand in favor of liberty, and, single handed, maintained a six
  years’ war in its defence, against the greatest odds. At a time when France and
  England were yet involved in bigotry and superstition, Holland achieved for herself
  civil and religious freedom, and opened her bosom as an asylum for the oppressed
  Huguenots; while others, the pilgrim fathers sought a refuge from persecution in
  the wilds of America. Holland for a long time took the lead of all the surrounding
  nations in commerce, in science, in arts, and in arms. For the inventions of the
  telescope, microscope, thermometer, pendulum, gunpowder, and printing, the world
  is indebted to the Dutch. And the best and most correct translation of the original
  Scriptures, in any language, is that of the Low Dutch, made under the auspices of
  the Synod of Dort. "
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: In what could be a sly parallel to racial prejudice, the historic contributions
  of the Dutch are positively evaluated. The Synod of Dort was the Calvinistic theological
  gathering that cemented the TULIP doctrine of total human depravity.
