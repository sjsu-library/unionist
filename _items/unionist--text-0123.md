transcription: "<em>Character of the Dutch,</em>—It is well known that a habit prevails
  almost every where, of underrating and<br>disparaging Dutch character and Dutchmen.
  Nothing is more unjust, and nothing is<br>more common—nothing testifies more unequivocally
  the ignorance and prejudice of<br>those who indulge in it, than the habit.—England
  is called the mother; but if<br>such of our population, whose ancestors emigrated
  from her shores are proud of<br>their origin, much more reason have they, who are
  descendants of the honest<br>burgomasters of Holland, to be proud of theirs.—Holland,
  though occupying a<br>territory not larger than the state of Maryland, was first
  among the nations of<br>Europe to take a stand in favor of liberty, and, single
  handed, maintained a six<br>years’ war in its defence, against the greatest odds.
  At a time when France and<br>England were yet involved in bigotry and superstition,
  Holland achieved for<br>herself civil and religious freedom, and opened her bosom
  as an asylum for the<br>oppressed Huguenots; while others, the pilgrim fathers sought
  a refuge from<br>persecution in the wilds of America. Holland for a long time took
  the lead of<br>all the surrounding nations in commerce, in science, in arts, and
  in arms. For<br>the inventions of the telescope, microscope, thermometer, pendulum,
  gunpowder,<br>and printing, the world is indebted to the Dutch. And the best and
  most correct<br>translation of the original Scriptures, in any language, is that
  of the Low<br>Dutch, made under the auspices of the Synod of Dort.<br>"
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: In what could be a sly parallel to racial prejudice, the historic contributions
  of the Dutch are positively evaluated. The Synod of Dort was the Calvinistic theological
  gathering that cemented the TULIP doctrine of total human depravity.
