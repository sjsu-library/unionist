caption: Frederick Olney (1810-1869) was a prominent free Black throughout the Antebellum
  area, in both Windham and New London counties. He was a brother-in-law to Sarah
  Harris Fayerweather, attended various Abolitionist and Black convention meetings,
  and worked as a teacher. But we have no picture of him. I imagine him as a tall,
  well-built young man, and a favorite with the students, who remained proud despite
  the harassment of the white Canterburians.
