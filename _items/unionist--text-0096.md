transcription: We are told in the last Advertiser, that the counsel for Miss Crandall
  in the<br>recent trial, “spoke like men who were paid for it,” but that Messrs.
  Judson and<br>Welch “spoke<br><em>“con amore.”</em>If Messrs. Ellsworth and Strong
  argue so powerfully and conclusively merely for<br>pay, what, we may well ask,<br><em>would
  they do</em>if they should speak<br><em>“con amore.</em>” We have no wish to underrate
  the merits of the counsel for the prosecution; we<br>doubt not they did their best.
  The gentleman who closed we would allude to in<br>particular as having displayed
  ability and ingenuity worthy of a better cause.<br>True we could not but think he
  in some instances approached nearer to coarsness<br>[sic] and vulgarity than was
  altogether seemly under existing circumstances, but<br>considering he was “trammeled
  by a bad cause,” he certainly acquitted himself<br>very creditably. But were we
  desirous of eulogizing him and his colleague, we<br>would not accuse them of arguing
  such a cause<br><em>“con amore”</em>or represent them as having on that occasion
  exhibited “logical precision, and<br>elegance of language unusual even to themselves.”<br>
