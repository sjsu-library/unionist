transcription: 'We are told in the last Advertiser, that the counsel for Miss Crandall
  in the recent trial, “spoke like men who were paid for it,” but that Messrs. Judson
  and Welch “spoke <em>“con amore.”</em> If Messrs. Ellsworth and Strong argue so
  powerfully and conclusively merely for pay, what, we may well ask, <em>would they
  do</em> if they should speak <em>“con amore.</em> ” We have no wish to underrate
  the merits of the counsel for the prosecution; we doubt not they did their best.
  The gentleman who closed we would allude to in particular as having displayed ability
  and ingenuity worthy of a better cause. True we could not but think he in some instances
  approached nearer to coarsness [sic] and vulgarity than was altogether seemly under
  existing circumstances, but considering he was “trammeled by a bad cause,” he certainly
  acquitted himself very creditably. But were we desirous of eulogizing him and his
  colleague, we would not accuse them of arguing such a cause <em>“con amore”</em>
  or represent them as having on that occasion exhibited “logical precision, and elegance
  of language unusual even to themselves.” '
