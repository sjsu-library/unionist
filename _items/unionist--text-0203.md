transcription: "<p>THE LIFE AND TRAVELS OF THE APOSTLE PAUL.</p><p>  LILLY, Wait,
  &amp; Co. have just published a beautiful 18mo volume containing<br>  272 pages,
  with the above title. It is furnished with questions, rendering it<br>  suitable
  for use in Sunday schools. The work has undergone a careful revision,<br>  by a
  clergyman of the Episcopal Church, residing in the western part of this<br>  state,
  and may be considered a valuable addition to Sunday school literature.<br>  We believe
  it will be acceptable to Christians generally, being free from<br>  everything of
  a sectarian character. To the volume is prefixed a neat Map of<br>  the countries
  traveled and the places visited by the Apostle. This map is on<br>  red ground with
  white letters, a style of engraving which we have not before<br>  seen in American
  books. It produces the best effect.<br></p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Boston,<br>  Nov,<br>  25.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

scholarlyNotes: Considered by some to be a review
commentary: The Abolitionists were immersed in Biblical narratives, including the
  story of Paul - hard work, across vast geographic areas, and martyrdom.
