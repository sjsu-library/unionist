transcription: "<p>THE LIFE AND TRAVELS OF THE APOSTLE PAUL.</p> <p> LILLY, Wait,
  &amp; Co. have just published a beautiful 18mo volume containing 272 pages, with
  the above title. It is furnished with questions, rendering it suitable for use in
  Sunday schools. The work has undergone a careful revision, by a clergyman of the
  Episcopal Church, residing in the western part of this state, and may be considered
  a valuable addition to Sunday school literature. We believe it will be acceptable
  to Christians generally, being free from everything of a sectarian character. To
  the volume is prefixed a neat Map of the countries traveled and the places visited
  by the Apostle. This map is on red ground with white letters, a style of engraving
  which we have not before seen in American books. It produces the best effect. </p>
  <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Boston, Nov,
  25.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

scholarlyNotes: Considered by some to be a review
commentary: 'The Abolitionists were immersed in Biblical narratives. The story of
  Paul had much to offer them: a conversion experience, commitment to proselytizing
  across vast geographic areas and through patent danger, and ultimate martyrdom.'
