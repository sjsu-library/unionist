  align="center">Another Reformation in the Church must be attempted.</p><p align="center">  “Attempt
  great things—expect great things.” (The voice of the departed. [sic<br>  no close
  parentheses]<br></p><p>  IN consequence of the light poured on the public, and the
  church, by the<br>  spirited exertions of philanthropic individuals, a great change,
  in relation<br>  to intoxicating liquors, has been produced. The eye, heart, and
  hand of<br>  christian faith looks, prays, and acts for its completion.<br></p><p>  But
  another reformation is needed in the church. It must be as separate from<br>  slavery,
  as from intemperance. The nation groans under the burden and misery<br>  and guilt
  of both these sins. It is the solemn duty of the church to clear<br>  itself from
  both these tremendous crimes. This is not addressed to the world,<br>  for the world
  legalizes the traffic in rum, and in the bodies and souls of<br>  men. But it is
  addressed to the children of God, who, if they know and do<br>  their duty, can
  have no possible connection with either of these trades. If<br>  increasing light
  has shown that christians ought not to buy and sell ardent<br>  spirits, much more
  it is believed, will increasing light show that christians<br>  ought not to buy
  human beings.<br></p><p>  The Rev. John Newton, even after he became pious, transported
  Africans in<br>  chains across the Atlantic, to be sold with their posterity into
  slavery.<br>  Could he have been a true christian, and have no upbraidings of conscience<br>  while
  so engaged? Yes. How is it possible? It was legal, and, at that time,<br>  honorable,
  and his mind was not enlightened.—Afterwards when it was he<br>  lamented his error.
  So there are in our country those who buy and sell their<br>  fellow beings, who,
  if their minds were enlightened, would lament and<br>  relinquish it.<br></p><p>  A
  few years ago, a man, whose whole daily earnings were required by his<br>  family,
  set up forty nights to run a distillery for forty dollars, which he<br>  gave to
  build a house of worship.—How could he think that money obtained by<br>  changing
  the bread of the poor, into the liquid fire of death, acceptable to<br>  God? Because
  his mind was in darkness. Would he do it now? No. Neither would<br>  the church
  now receive it. Why? Because the light of the temperance<br>  reformation has burst
  forth.<br></p><p>  Christians! who have promised supreme obedience to Him, that
  :tasted death for<br>  every man,: and more for the rich man, who, in a superb dress,
  rides in a<br>  superb carriage, to a superb church, to worship in superb style,
  than for the<br>  poor African, who pulls cotton in the “fields of Alabama, and
  naked as in the<br>  hour of birth, trembles under the blasts of mid winter”—on
  you is this call<br>  for a reformation in the church of that God, who declares
  himself no respector<br>  [sic] of persons.—Why do you exclude the dealer in ardent
  spirits from the<br>  communion table, and invite to it the dealer in human flesh?
  This could not,<br>  would not be, if there had been half so much effort made to
  show the utter<br>  abominations of christian slavery, as there has been to show
  the abominations<br>  of christian drunkenness. Whatever maybe the event of slavery
  and intemperance<br>  in the world a sufficiency of light will show, and cause to
  be removed<br>  these&nbsp; shocking deformities of the christian church. One denomination
  has<br>  already raised thousands of dollars to assist their brethren in becoming
  free<br>  from the deep stains of this awful sin. When will other denominations
  be<br>  equally sincere and active to cleanse themselves from this pollution? The<br>  answer
  is plain. When they are as conscientious and as much enlightened.<br></p><p>  To
  have light poured on this subject as its importance demands, it is proposed<br>  to
  raise fifty dollars, as a premium for the best essay on this deeply<br>  interesting
  subject. When the church if pure, we may then expect the smiles<br>  and approbation
  of heaven on our now almost divided land. And oh! May none<br>  refuse their mite
  to reward the close application of time and talents to this<br>  most vitally important
  theme; for it is believed the temperance reformation<br>  commenced in this way.<br></p><p>  Donations
  will be received by the Editors of the Genius of Temperance, and the<br>  Editor
  of the Emancipator, 126, Nassau street, A part of the money has already<br>  been
  raised by a few ladies in Massachusetts. It is hoped that others, who are<br>  opposed
  to slavery in the church of Christ, will speedily forward enough to<br>  make it
  up to $50, when the sum will be given to him who shall show most<br>  conclusively
  to the christian church and to christian ministers, their duty to<br>  “Break every
  yoke.” The essays which shall be written for the prize, are to be<br>  judged, and
  the premium awarded, by ________<br></p><p>[N.B.—The blank will be filled, when
  the money is subscribed.]</p><p></p>'
