transcription: "<em>The Land of the Free!”</em>—A Miss Crandall established, some
  months since, at Canterbury, Conn., a school<br>for the instruction of colored children
  and youth. Praiseworthy as the motives<br>of this benevolent female in undertaking
  to improve the condition of the<br>children of this unfortunate and degraded class
  of our population, may be<br>considered, she soon found herself seriously opposed
  by the good people in the<br>vicinity, who went so far as to memorialize the Legislature
  on the subject. The<br>Legislature complied with the petition of the memorialists,
  and passed an act,<br>making it<br><em>  unlawful to instruct children of color
  from any other state!” – Batavia,<br>  (New-York) Advocate.”<br></em>"
scholarlyNotes:
