transcription: "<em>The Land of the Free!”</em> —A Miss Crandall established, some
  months since, at Canterbury, Conn., a school for the instruction of colored children
  and youth. Praiseworthy as the motives of this benevolent female in undertaking
  to improve the condition of the children of this unfortunate and degraded class
  of our population, may be considered, she soon found herself seriously opposed by
  the good people in the vicinity, who went so far as to memorialize the Legislature
  on the subject. The Legislature complied with the petition of the memorialists,
  and passed an act, making it <em> unlawful to instruct children of color from any
  other state!” – Batavia, (New-York) Advocate.” </em>"
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: Batavia is located between Rochester and Buffalo in upstate New York.
