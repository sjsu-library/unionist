transcription: "<em>“Carrying the war into Egypt,”</em> —We had supposed that the
  crusade which the good people of Canterbury, Ct have for some time past waged against
  the school of <em>Miss Crandall,</em> would have been suffered to drop when the
  whole force of legal proceedings had been spent upon them, and the lady herself
  became one of the band of “reputably married ladies.” But we find by advertisements
  in the last Brooklyn Unionist, that her neighbors were not as charitably and forgivingly
  disposed as ourself. Mr. Calvin Phileo, the husband of Miss C. advertises in the
  paper above named, that during the night of the ninth instant his house was assaulted
  by a number of persons armed with heavy clubs and iron bars, who destroyed five
  window sashes and about one hundred panes of glass, and the family greatly alarmed,
  though it does not appear any of them were injured. Mr. Phileo and lady have consequently
  determined to quit that ‘heathenish neighborhood,’ and offer their house and appurtenances
  for sale, and a reward of fifty dollars for such information as may lead to the
  detection of their assailants. The reputation of the city of Canterbury will (if
  it has not already) suffer more in the estimation of the dispassionate and unprejudiced
  in all parts of the Union, than have the parties and principles against whom they
  have kept up such an exterminating war, if the institution is not allowed to be
  dissolved without further violence, and its inmates permitted to ‘depart in peace.’” "
