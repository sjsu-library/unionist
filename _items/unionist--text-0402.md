transcription: "<em>“Carrying the war into Egypt,”</em>\n—We had supposed that the
  crusade which the good people of Canterbury, Ct have\nfor some time past waged against
  the school of <em>Miss Crandall,</em> would have been suffered to drop when the
  whole force of legal proceedings had\nbeen spent upon them, and the lady herself
  became one of the band of “reputably\nmarried ladies.” But we find by advertisements
  in the last Brooklyn Unionist,\nthat her neighbors were not as charitably and forgivingly
  disposed as ourself.\nMr. Calvin Phileo, the husband of Miss C. advertises in the
  paper above named,\nthat during the night of the ninth instant his house was assaulted
  by a number\nof persons armed with heavy clubs and iron bars, who destroyed five
  window\nsashes and about one hundred panes of glass, and the family greatly alarmed,\nthough
  it does not appear any of them were injured. Mr. Phileo and lady have\nconsequently
  determined to quit that ‘heathenish neighborhood,’ and offer their\nhouse and appurtenances
  for sale, and a reward of fifty dollars for such\ninformation as may lead to the
  detection of their assailants. The reputation of\nthe city of Canterbury will (if
  it has not already) suffer more in the\nestimation of the dispassionate and unprejudiced
  in all parts of the Union, than\nhave the parties and principles against whom they
  have kept up such an\nexterminating war, if the institution is not allowed to be
  dissolved without\nfurther violence, and its inmates permitted to ‘depart in peace.’” "
