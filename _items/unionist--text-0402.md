transcription: "<em>“Carrying the war into Egypt,”</em>—We had supposed that the crusade
  which the good people of Canterbury, Ct have <br>for some time past waged against
  the school of <br><em>Miss Crandall,</em>would have been suffered to drop when the
  whole force of legal proceedings had <br>been spent upon them, and the lady herself
  became one of the band of “reputably <br>married ladies.” But we find by advertisements
  in the last Brooklyn Unionist, <br>that her neighbors were not as charitably and
  forgivingly disposed as ourself. <br>Mr. Calvin Phileo, the husband of Miss C. advertises
  in the paper above named, <br>that during the night of the ninth instant his house
  was assaulted by a number <br>of persons armed with heavy clubs and iron bars, who
  destroyed five window <br>sashes and about one hundred panes of glass, and the family
  greatly alarmed, <br>though it does not appear any of them were injured. Mr. Phileo
  and lady have <br>consequently determined to quit that ‘heathenish neighborhood,’
  and offer their <br>house and appurtenances for sale, and a reward of fifty dollars
  for such <br>information as may lead to the detection of their assailants. The reputation
  of <br>the city of Canterbury will (if it has not already) suffer more in the <br>estimation
  of the dispassionate and unprejudiced in all parts of the Union, than <br>have the
  parties and principles against whom they have kept up such an <br>exterminating
  war, if the institution is not allowed to be dissolved without <br>further violence,
  and its inmates permitted to ‘depart in peace.’” "
