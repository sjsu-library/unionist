transcription: "<p>FEMALE ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY.</p><p>  On Tuesday afternoon last,
  the adjourned meeting of the ladies of Brooklyn and<br>  vicinity was held in Mr.
  Davison’s Hall.<br></p><p>  Prayer was offered by Rev. Mr. May. The committee appointed
  at the previous<br>  meeting to correspond with other Female Anti-Slavery Societies,
  reported that<br>  they had written to the Societies, in Philadephia, New-York and
  Boston. One<br>  letter in answer had been received—and that a very interesting
  one from<br>  Lucretia Mott of Philadelphia. It was read by Mrs. Herbert Williams.<br></p><p>
  \ The meeting was then addressed at considerable length, and in a very<br>  impressive
  manner, by Charles Stuart, Esq. He pointed out the peculiarities in<br>  the character
  and circumstances of woman, which enable her to be an important<br>  instrument
  in all moral reforms.<br></p><p>  Mr. William Lloyd Garrison and Mr. May also offered
  some remarks to encourage<br>  the philanthropic, for which the meeting was then
  convened.<br></p><p>A form of Constitution was then read and adopted as follows:—</p><p>
  \ <em>    Constitution of the Female Anti-Slavery Society of Brooklyn and vicinity.<br>
  \ </em></p><p>  Preamble.—Whereas the system of slavery which exists in a portion
  of this land<br>  is contrary to every principle of humanity, honor, and religion,
  is derogatory<br>  to the character of our country abroad, and injurious to its
  peace and<br>  prosperity at home, and renders us obnoxious to the righteous condemnation
  of<br>  the Most High.<br></p><p>  And whereas more than a million of our own sex
  are now groaning under the yoke<br>  of an insupportable and most degrading bondage,
  unprotected by law, or by any<br>  sense of manly shame, from merciless stripes
  and cruel outrage, are subjected<br>  by a traffic in the bodies of human beings,
  more dreadful than<br>  <em>death,</em>  to the sudden and cruel sundering of the
  most sacred relations of domestic<br>  life, are deprived of knowledge, and as far
  as the power of their oppressors<br>  extends, of the hopes of the blessed gospel.<br></p><p>
  \ And whereas the demoralizing influence of this atrocious system, by inducing<br>
  \ woman to sanction and even voluntarily to practice its barbarities, often<br>
  \ renders her even more deserving of the commiseration of Christians than when<br>
  \ she is its involuntary victim,—sin being so much greater an evil than<br>  suffering.<br></p><p>
  \ And whereas an enlightened and Christian public sentiment alone is, under God,<br>
  \ likely to abolish this atrocious and complicated system of iniquity, to arrest<br>
  \ from our country the impending judgments of the Almighty.<br></p><p>  And whereas,
  female influence is calculated to effect great good in such a<br>  cause, as has
  been abundantly shown in the abolition of British Colonial<br>  Slavery.<br></p><p>
  \ We therefore, in behalf of ‘the suffering and the dumb,’ desiring to exercise<br>
  \ towards both the oppressor and the oppressed the spirit of Christian<br>  benevolence,
  and imploring the Father of all mercies for his guidance and aid,<br>  in our efforts
  to subserve his will in this most holy cause, do agree to form<br>  ourselves into
  a Society to be governed by the following<br></p><p>CONSTITUTION.</p><p>  1.This
  Society shall be called the Female Anti-Slavery Society of Brooklyn and<br>  its
  vicinity.<br></p><p>  2.The objects of this Society shall be, First, to aid in the
  diffusion of<br>  information on the subject of Slavery; to portray its true character;
  to prove<br>  its utter indefensibleness on any principle of religion, justice or<br>
  \ expediency. Second, to promote the elevation of the colored people of our<br>
  \ country to the equal enjoyment with ourselves of these rights and privileges<br>
  \ which are acknowledged to be inalienable, as the birthright of man. Third, to<br>
  \ aid in general the American Anti-Slavery Society in its benevolent objects.<br></p><p>
  \ 3.Any female approving the principles of this Society, and contributing to its<br>
  \ funds, shall be a member.<br></p><p>[Here follow the usual articles for the government
  of the Society.]</p><p>  Twenty two ladies then subscribed their names as members
  of the Society—and<br>  made choice of the following officers.<br></p><p>  <em>President,</em>
  \ Mrs. Herbert Williams<br></p><p>  <em>Vice President,</em>  Mrs. Maria W. Lyon<br></p><p>
  \ Miss Mary Burleigh,<br>  <em>Secretary.</em></p><p>  Miss Sarah Benson,<br>  <em>Treasurer.</em></p><p>
  \ Miss Lucretia Lee,<br>  <em>Librarian.</em></p><p>  <em>    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Managers.<br>  </em></p><p>  Mrs. Syrena Sharpe, Miss Martha Smith, Mrs. Louisa
  Williams, Miss Olive<br>  Gilbert, Miss Martha E. Williams, Miss Elizabeth Mather.<br></p>"
