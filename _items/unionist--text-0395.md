  <p>FEMALE ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY.</p>
  <p>
    On Tuesday afternoon last, the adjourned meeting of the ladies of Brooklyn and
    vicinity was held in Mr. Davison’s Hall.
  </p>
  <p>
    Prayer was offered by Rev. Mr. May. The committee appointed at the previous
    meeting to correspond with other Female Anti-Slavery Societies, reported that
    they had written to the Societies, in Philadephia, New-York and Boston. One
    letter in answer had been received—and that a very interesting one from
    Lucretia Mott of Philadelphia. It was read by Mrs. Herbert Williams.
  </p>
  <p>
    The meeting was then addressed at considerable length, and in a very
    impressive manner, by Charles Stuart, Esq. He pointed out the peculiarities in
    the character and circumstances of woman, which enable her to be an important
    instrument in all moral reforms.
  </p>
  <p>
    Mr. William Lloyd Garrison and Mr. May also offered some remarks to encourage
    the philanthropic, for which the meeting was then convened.
  </p>
  <p>A form of Constitution was then read and adopted as follows:—</p>
  <p>
    <em>
      Constitution of the Female Anti-Slavery Society of Brooklyn and vicinity.
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    Preamble.—Whereas the system of slavery which exists in a portion of this land
    is contrary to every principle of humanity, honor, and religion, is derogatory
    to the character of our country abroad, and injurious to its peace and
    prosperity at home, and renders us obnoxious to the righteous condemnation of
    the Most High.
  </p>
  <p>
    And whereas more than a million of our own sex are now groaning under the yoke
    of an insupportable and most degrading bondage, unprotected by law, or by any
    sense of manly shame, from merciless stripes and cruel outrage, are subjected
    by a traffic in the bodies of human beings, more dreadful than
    <em>death,</em>
    to the sudden and cruel sundering of the most sacred relations of domestic
    life, are deprived of knowledge, and as far as the power of their oppressors
    extends, of the hopes of the blessed gospel.
  </p>
  <p>
    And whereas the demoralizing influence of this atrocious system, by inducing
    woman to sanction and even voluntarily to practice its barbarities, often
    renders her even more deserving of the commiseration of Christians than when
    she is its involuntary victim,—sin being so much greater an evil than
    suffering.
  </p>
  <p>
    And whereas an enlightened and Christian public sentiment alone is, under God,
    likely to abolish this atrocious and complicated system of iniquity, to arrest
    from our country the impending judgments of the Almighty.
  </p>
  <p>
    And whereas, female influence is calculated to effect great good in such a
    cause, as has been abundantly shown in the abolition of British Colonial
    Slavery.
  </p>
  <p>
    We therefore, in behalf of ‘the suffering and the dumb,’ desiring to exercise
    towards both the oppressor and the oppressed the spirit of Christian
    benevolence, and imploring the Father of all mercies for his guidance and aid,
    in our efforts to subserve his will in this most holy cause, do agree to form
    ourselves into a Society to be governed by the following
  </p>
  <p>CONSTITUTION.</p>
  <p>
    1.This Society shall be called the Female Anti-Slavery Society of Brooklyn and
    its vicinity.
  </p>
  <p>
    2.The objects of this Society shall be, First, to aid in the diffusion of
    information on the subject of Slavery; to portray its true character; to prove
    its utter indefensibleness on any principle of religion, justice or
    expediency. Second, to promote the elevation of the colored people of our
    country to the equal enjoyment with ourselves of these rights and privileges
    which are acknowledged to be inalienable, as the birthright of man. Third, to
    aid in general the American Anti-Slavery Society in its benevolent objects.
  </p>
  <p>
    3.Any female approving the principles of this Society, and contributing to its
    funds, shall be a member.
  </p>
  <p>[Here follow the usual articles for the government of the Society.]</p>
  <p>
    Twenty two ladies then subscribed their names as members of the Society—and
    made choice of the following officers.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>President,</em>
    Mrs. Herbert Williams
