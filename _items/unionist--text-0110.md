transcription: EGYPTIAN NEWSPAPER.—A journal is now published at Alexandria, under
  the title of<br>Miszer Wekaiesi (Egyptian News.). The Vignette of this paper, in
  opposition to<br>the Ottoman Crescent, presents half a sun, shining forth from behind
  a pyramid,<br>on the side of which stands a flourishing young palm tree. On the
  left of the<br>vignette are these words:—“Printed at the office of the<br><em>Divan
  of Events</em> in the Royal Castle.”—This paper, which is in the Arabic and Turkish
  languages,<br>gives no political news, but is confined to civil and military subjects,
  which<br>have merely a local interest.<br>
