transcription: 'EGYPTIAN NEWSPAPER.—A journal is now published at Alexandria, under
  the title of Miszer Wekaiesi (Egyptian News.). The Vignette of this paper, in opposition
  to the Ottoman Crescent, presents half a sun, shining forth from behind a pyramid,
  on the side of which stands a flourishing young palm tree. On the left of the vignette
  are these words:—“Printed at the office of the <em>Divan of Events</em> in the Royal
  Castle.”—This paper, which is in the Arabic and Turkish languages, gives no political
  news, but is confined to civil and military subjects, which have merely a local
  interest. '
