transcription: "<p>THE YOUNG MANâ€™S GUIDE.</p> <p> A VOLUME of 320 pages, designed
  as a cheap manual for Young Men, though it is believed to embrace much useful information
  to persons in every description; especially parents. It is divided into seven chapters;
  to which are prefixed a very full table of contents and an introduction. The great
  object of the author of the work, who has had much experience with youth, is to
  stimulate them to aim at a high standard of character, and to make the mental, social,
  and moral improvement of themselves and those around them, a governing purpose of
  their lives. </p> "
