  a respectable source, to the editor of the National   Gazette (Philadelphia). </p>
  <p>“LANCASTER, 22d Feb. 1834.</p> <p>   We have this day celebrated the birthday
  of the Father of our Country, by   holding a meeting in favor of a restoration of
  the Federal Deposites. It was   the largest and most respectable ever held in this
  county. We got between two   and three thousand signers to our memorials to Congress.
  It was held without   distinction of parties. The presiding officers and committee
  men were   principally of the Jackson party.” </p> "
