transcription: '<p>"Mr. Judson’s Circular,” from the <em>Genius of Temperance</em>
  , in <em>The Unionist</em> 1:2:3, column 4</p><p> MR. JUDSON’S CIRCULAR— We have
  seen a Circular written by Andrew T. Judson, Canterbury, in vindication of his conduct
  towards Miss Crandall, and in favor of the new law, under which she was imprisoned.
  It is a very lame affair: much more so than we should have expected from a lawyer,
  aspiring to a seat in Congress. He does not even make a <em>plausible</em> defence.
  The very <em>plea</em> must insure <em>condemnation</em> among republicans. Miss
  Crandall’s school, according to Mr. Judson, is to be legislated down— <em>not</em>
  because colored people are not human beings—“created free and equal”—not because
  they are not entitled to education— <em>not</em> because the object is undesirable—
  <em>not</em> because Miss Crandall was incompetent to teach them— <em>not</em> because
  the town was in danger (as had been pretended) of being overrun with paupers, but
  because Miss Crandall is an <em>abolitionist!</em> A fine TEST ACT, truly! Why not
  because she is a Baptist? A large portion of the Baptists, and of other sects, we
  trust, are rapidly embracing the heresy against which “His Grace, the” [American]
  “Lord Bishop of Canterbury” has fulminated his papal bull. And so the abolitionists
  are legally disqualified from school teaching, are they? From what will they next
  be debarred? From preaching? From medical and from legal practice? From buying and
  selling? as rumor even now reports of Canterbury, and as the Revelator of Patmos
  has predicted, of the latter days?”&nbsp; (Rev.xiii.17.)</p><p> Mr. Judson pleads
  in favor of Canterbury legislation, that the people of <em>other</em> towns, would
  be as unwilling as those of Canterbury, to see a similar school established, and
  then to strengthen this, by <em>another</em> plea, he complains because Miss Crandall
  did not accept his offer to remove her <em>location!</em> This savors of the Irish,
  as well as of the Romish bull! Much in the same vein of logic, Mr. Judson defends
  the <em>Connecticut</em> law, by remarking that schools might be established in
  <em>other</em> states! Above all, the <em>present</em> law of Connecticut, <em>against</em>
  the free and unrestrained education of the colored people, Mr. Judson argues, <em>cannot</em>
  be <em>bad,</em> BECAUSE a <em>former</em> law of that state, (as yet unrepealed—a
  law,—he <em>might</em> have said—enacted when <em>all</em> the people of Connecticut
  were “abolitionists,” and ere the cunning device of Colonizationism was dreamed
  of)—is a <em>good</em> one and contains <em>contrary</em> characteristics!”</p><p
  align="center">“A Daniel! still I say, a second Daniel!”</p><p> Mr. Judson must
  certainly be sent to Congress! – <em>Genius of Temperance</em></p>'
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: The anti-Catholic sentiment that was always bubbling beneath the surface
  of the Reform movements rears its head in the open for a moment here.
