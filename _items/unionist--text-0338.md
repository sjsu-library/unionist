scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: '<p>Amos Phelps (1805-1847) was an endorser of the school. His pamphlet
  being locally available suggests, once again, that the students at the Canterbury
  Female Academy were reading about their own struggle!</p><p> <p> </p> <p>The pamphlet
  in question, for instance, compared the Canterbury Female Academy students to impressed
  sailors (one of the alleged causes of the War of 1812): “The war of the revolution
  was a contest for principle. Had the principle in question been yielded, who could
  have set limits to the acts of oppression growing out it ? So also in our war for
  sailors’ rights, the bone of contention was, the right of search and impressment.
  The mere fact that a few seamen had been injured and abused, was as nothing, aside
  from the principle involved. This, in common with that of the revolution, was a
  contest for principle, and the oppression resisted was the oppression of principle.
  And further, whence the utter odiousness and the cruel oppression of the far-famed
  ‘black law’ of Connecticut? Not that Miss Crandall and a few colored Misses are
  subjected by it to certain shameful acts of cruelty and oppression. These are as
  nothing, comparatively, except as they involve principle; and the law, which allows
  and sanctions them, is itself comparatively harmless and innocent, except as it
  involves principle—principle which puts in jeopardy the rights of thousands.</p>
