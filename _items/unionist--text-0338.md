scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: "<p>Amos Phelps (1805-1847) was an endorser of the school. His pamphlet
  being locally available suggests, once again, that the students at the Canterbury
  Female Academy were reading about their own struggle!</p><p> <p></p><p>The pamphlet
  in question, for instance, compared the Canterbury Female Academy students to impressed
  sailors (one of the alleged causes of the War of 1812): <br>  “The war of the revolution
  was a contest for principle. Had the principle in <br>  question been yielded, who
  could have set limits to the acts of oppression <br>  growing out it ? So also in
  our war for sailors’ rights, the bone of <br>  contention was, the right of search
  and impressment. The mere fact that a few <br>  seamen had been injured and abused,
  was as nothing, aside from the principle <br>  involved. This, in common with that
  of the revolution, was a contest for <br>  principle, and the oppression resisted
  was the oppression of principle. And <br>  further, whence the utter odiousness
  and the cruel oppression of the far-famed <br>  ‘black law’ of Connecticut? Not
  that Miss Crandall and a few colored Misses <br>  are subjected by it to certain
  shameful acts of cruelty and oppression. These <br>  are as nothing, comparatively,
  except as they involve principle; and the law, <br>  which allows and sanctions
  them, is itself comparatively harmless and <br>  innocent, except as it involves
  principle—principle which puts in jeopardy the <br>  rights of thousands.</p>  <p>Amos
  A. Phelps,  <br>  <em>Lectures on Slavery and Its Remedy.</em>  (Boston: New-England
  Anti-Slavery Society, 1834), p. 28</p>  <p>Also available online here: https://ia600609.us.archive.org/14/items/lecturesonslaver01phel/lecturesonslaver01phel.pdf
