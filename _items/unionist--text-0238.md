  align="center">_ _ _</p><p align="center"><em>Concluded.</em></p><p>  Various were
  the conjectures concerning the cause of her sudden disappearance,<br>  and when
  at last they ventured to question Matilda, she replied with a great<br>  many signs
  and a few hypocritical tears, that her father had placed her under<br>  the car
  of his sister-in-law, the widow of an eminent physician, thinking her<br>  experience
  and virtuous example might be of service to Emily, that she was<br>  grieved for
  the cause, and wished not to be question on the subject. Thus, by<br>  her false
  insinuations, she deprived her of the esteem of the world—that world<br>  which
  will on day<br>  <em>worship</em>  and the next<br>  <em>stab</em>  you. Not contented
  with this, she persuaded Mr. Minnette to disinherit his<br>  daughter, and make
  a will in favor of the little George, but her cruelty was<br>  not to go unpunished.
  By some unforeseen losses in trade Mr. Minnette became<br>  bankrupt, and was obliged
  to sell his splendid establishment in —— street, and<br>  remove to a small house
  which belonged to Emily’s mother, and which was the<br>  only property he could
  not be deprived of. But to return to Emily.<br></p><p>  The picture of former days
  would sometimes rise, and appear like a fairy<br>  dream, from which she had been
  too soon awakened. She thought of the kind<br>  mother who had been ever ready to
  gratify her childish wishes—and of Edward,<br>  too, she thought much. Would he
  believe his sister’s falsehoods? was a<br>  question that often perplexed her. And
  were there no mingling of resentment in<br>  these recollections? Not any. Her heart
  had been taught a better discipline.<br></p><p>  Two years passed away, and Emily
  found peace, if not happiness. She was now<br>  twenty-one years old, and it was
  in her power to retaliate her injuries, by<br>  turning her father out of her house,
  which was now in her possession; but<br>  instead of this she wrote a long and kind
  letter, entreating him to occupy it<br>  as long as he wished.<br></p><p>  Having
  but little to engage her attention, Emily offered to teach a school for<br>  the
  children of the village. For this purpose, a room was fitted up in a small<br>  light
  building, erected near the river for the convenience of washing. During<br>  her
  residence with her kind aunt, it had been her favorite care to ornament<br>  and
  improve it. She had planted all around it the rose of cassia, jessamine,<br>  honeysuckle
  and grape vines. Their mingled blossoms and intertwining branches<br>  formed a
  luxuriant drapery, which soon became one mass of living verdure. From<br>  this
  little nest of flowers, an avenue, shaded by old elms, led down to the<br>  river,
  whose smooth surface was broken into ripples by the dipping branches of<br>  the
  weeping willow, as its waters went sparkling and gleaming along in their<br>  noiseless
  beauty. Here, in pleasant weather, Emily often ranged her scholars,<br>  in the
  open air; and then there were bright eyes and happy faces, for children<br>  do
  not love the confinement of a school room. The exercises of the day were<br>  generally
  concluded with a hymn and prayer, in which all were taught to join.<br></p><p>  It
  was near the close of a delightful day in June, and their melodious voices<br>  were
  just breaking the stillness of that beautiful solitude, when a gentleman,<br>  attracted
  by the sound, came to the opposite bank, and, concealed by the<br>  shade, listened
  with intense delight to the infant warblers.<br></p><p>  The last note died away,
  and a solemn pause ensued. “Now, my dear little<br>  children,” said Emily, “will
  you join me, with your whole hearts, in a prayer<br>  to our Heavenly Father who
  has watched over and protected us through the day.”<br>  She then kneeled down on
  the green earth, and was soon encircled by her cherub<br>  band of scholars, who
  also knelt and softly repeated, after their youthful<br>  instructress, The Lord’s
  Prayer. Then came the fervent “amen”—“Amen!” repeated<br>  their innocent lips,
  and “Amen!” echoed the green hills. Then, slowly, they<br>  all arose, kissed Emily,
  one by one, crossed the little bridge, and<br>  disappeared.<br></p><p>  But the
  stranger yet remained. It was Edward Brumiere, once the friend of<br>  Emily—and
  if he had ever doubted her, could he any longer question the<br>  goodness and purity
  of the beautiful being before him? It was impossible. A<br>  moment, and he was
  at her side. Surprise deepened the rose on her cheek, and<br>  she confessed the
  pleasure she felt in again meeting him. She extended her<br>  hand to him with a
  cordial smile, for she had not yet learned to hide her<br>  feelings under the mask
  of indifference.<br></p><p>  “I come from your father, my dear Emily. He is not
  very well, and feels the<br>  want of your kindness and good nursing.”<br></p><p>  “But
  where is my ———mother?” she enquired, hesitatingly. “She is obliged to<br>  divide
  her attentions between him and your little brother, who has been<br>  sometime ill,
  of a lingering complaint, which they fear will terminate in a<br>  consumption.
  But are you quite willing to forget your resentment?” “I have<br>  none.” “Your
  injuries then?” “I freely forgive them as I hope to be forgiven.”<br></p><p>  “Do
  you know their extent? Driven from your home, calumniated, disinherited,<br>  by
  one who pledged herself your friend.”<br></p><p>  While enumerating these, he closely
  watched her countenance, and finding there<br>  no expression but forgiving love,
  he continued, “or do you not feel their<br>  force?” An unbidden tear fell down
  her cheek, silently refuting the charge of<br>  insensibility.<br></p><p>  Love
  sprung in his heart spontaneous; and tenderly taking her hand, he said<br>  with
  much emotion, “Amiable girl!—have you no connection with earth, that you<br>  have
  divested yourself of human passions and frailties.”<br></p><p>  “Afflictions have
  been sanctified to me, and have taught me that hatred and<br>  happiness cannot
  exist in the same bosom.”<br></p><p>  “Matilda is my sister; forgive me, Emily!
  I believed what she said of you! I<br>  could almost<br>  <em>hate</em>  her for<br>  <em>your</em>  sake,
  had you not given me a better example.”<br></p><p>  “It is perfectly natural to
  believe the assertions of those we love; but I<br>  hope my study may be to contradict
  the tongue of slander by my conduct. Anger<br>  so blinds our reason, that Matilda
  might imagine me the unkind, guilty<br>  creature she represents me. Thus saying,
  she led the way to the house, where<br>  she introduced Edward to her aunt.<br></p><p>The
  next morning found them at Mr. Minnette’s door.</p><p>  Edward remained in the parlor,
  that he might put no restraint upon the<br>  feelings of either party, while Emily
  was shown to her father’s room. She<br>  clung round his neck—he embraced her, and
  she once more felt happy in his<br>  returning love.<br></p><p>  The open door of
  an adjoining room discovered Matilda, bending over the bed of<br>  her sick child,
  with all a mother’s fondness in her looks. In her deep anxiety<br>  the predominant
  expression of unbending pride was lost; and instead, there<br>  seemed something
  like repentance, nay, even kindness as her eye rested on<br>  Emily.<br></p><p>  From
  this time, Emily divided her cares between her father and brother, and<br>  determined
  by her attentions to merit the love of her family. Perhaps she was<br>  more condescending
  than some, yet none thought her mean-spirited, or weak, or<br>  respected her the
  less; but all admired the forgiving spirit she displayed.<br></p><p>  Mr. Minnette
  soon recovered, which gave some reason to suspect that his<br>  disorder originated
  in remorse; and now, Emily transferred all her attentions<br>  to her suffering
  brother. She had, while with her aunt (who was the medical<br>  adviser of the whole
  village) acquired considerable knowledge of roots and<br>  herbs, and these she
  successfully employed in his recovery.<br></p><p>  Every day she carried the sufferer
  out of doors in her arms for the benefit of<br>  exercise and fresh air, of which
  Matilda, by a mistake in the art of nursing,<br>  had deprived him. He soon felt
  the good effect of the change, and the<br>  delighted mother saw once more the glow
  of health upon his cheek, and<br>  returning activity in his tiny limbs.<br></p><p>  Matilda’s
  haughty spirit had been broken down by adversity, and Emily’s<br>  conduct had shamed
  “the offending spirit” out of her. Her understanding was<br>  naturally good, but
  it had been perverted by a faulty education, dictated by<br>  an injudiciously fond
  parent. A train of concurring circumstances roused her<br>  better feelings and
  they triumphed over the errors of education and the<br>  habitual follies of many
  years! and she bent before the altar of her God, a<br>  repentant woman and a humble
  and sincere christian. And now, from being the<br>  most wretched, they became,
  proverbially, the most united and happy family in<br>  New-York. Having performed
  her duties at home, Emily, according to promise,<br>  returned to her aunt, accompanied
  by Edward, who by the consent of all parties<br>  had become her betrothed husband.<br></p><p>  “Let
  us be married, Emily,” said he, “on the anniversary of the river scene;<br>  then
  I shall unite in one the two most interesting events of my life, my<br>  marriage
  and the event which led to it.”<br></p><p>  A year from that day, Emily became the
  wife of Edward—and each succeeding one<br>  finds her in the midst of love and happiness
  surrounded by her family of<br>  little ones, to whom Edward annually repeats the
  Tale of Forgiveness.<br></p>

  likely candidate
commentary: The author of this piece is unknown. This is the conclusion of a multi-part
  story. There are clear parallels between<br>Emily and Prudence in terms of the piety
  involved in conducting a school<br>
