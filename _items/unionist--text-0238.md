    Various were the conjectures concerning the cause of her sudden disappearance,
    and when at last they ventured to question Matilda, she replied with a great
    many signs and a few hypocritical tears, that her father had placed her under
    the care of his sister-in-law, the widow of an eminent physician, thinking her
    experience and virtuous example might be of service to Emily, that she was
    grieved for the cause, and wished not to be question on the subject. Thus, by
    her false insinuations, she deprived her of the esteem of the world—that world
    which will one day <em>worship</em> and the next <em>stab</em>
    you. Not contented with this, she persuaded Mr. Minnette to disinherit his
    daughter, and make a will in favor of the little George, but her cruelty was
    not to go unpunished. By some unforeseen losses in trade Mr. Minnette became
    bankrupt, and was obliged to sell his splendid establishment in —— street, and
    remove to a small house which belonged to Emily’s mother, and which was the
    only property he could not be deprived of. But to return to Emily.
  </p>
  <p>
    The picture of former days would sometimes rise, and appear like a fairy
    dream, from which she had been too soon awakened. She thought of the kind
    mother who had been ever ready to gratify her childish wishes—and of Edward,
    too, she thought much. Would he believe his sister’s falsehoods? was a
    question that often perplexed her. And were there no mingling of resentment in
    these recollections? Not any. Her heart had been taught a better discipline.
  </p>
  <p>
    Two years passed away, and Emily found peace, if not happiness. She was now
    twenty-one years old, and it was in her power to retaliate her injuries, by
    turning her father out of her house, which was now in her possession; but
    instead of this she wrote a long and kind letter, entreating him to occupy it
    as long as he wished.
  </p>
  <p>
    Having but little to engage her attention, Emily offered to teach a school for
    the children of the village. For this purpose, a room was fitted up in a small
    light building, erected near the river for the convenience of washing. During
    her residence with her kind aunt, it had been her favorite care to ornament
    and improve it. She had planted all around it the rose of cassia, jessamine,
    honeysuckle and grape vines. Their mingled blossoms and intertwining branches
    formed a luxuriant drapery, which soon became one mass of living verdure. From
    this little nest of flowers, an avenue, shaded by old elms, led down to the
    river, whose smooth surface was broken into ripples by the dipping branches of
    the weeping willow, as its waters went sparkling and gleaming along in their
    noiseless beauty. Here, in pleasant weather, Emily often ranged her scholars,
    in the open air; and then there were bright eyes and happy faces, for children
    do not love the confinement of a school room. The exercises of the day were
    generally concluded with a hymn and prayer, in which all were taught to join.
  </p>
  <p>
    It was near the close of a delightful day in June, and their melodious voices
    were just breaking the stillness of that beautiful solitude, when a gentleman,
    attracted by the sound, came to the opposite bank, and, concealed by the
    shade, listened with intense delight to the infant warblers.
  </p>
  <p>
    The last note died away, and a solemn pause ensued. “Now, my dear little
    children,” said Emily, “will you join me, with your whole hearts, in a prayer
    to our Heavenly Father who has watched over and protected us through the day.”
    She then kneeled down on the green earth, and was soon encircled by her cherub
    band of scholars, who also knelt and softly repeated, after their youthful
    instructress, The Lord’s Prayer. Then came the fervent “amen”—“Amen!” repeated
    their innocent lips, and “Amen!” echoed the green hills. Then, slowly, they
    all arose, kissed Emily, one by one, crossed the little bridge, and
    disappeared.
  </p>
  <p>
    But the stranger yet remained. It was Edward Brumiere, once the friend of
    Emily—and if he had ever doubted her, could he any longer question the
    goodness and purity of the beautiful being before him? It was impossible. A
    moment, and he was at her side. Surprise deepened the rose on her cheek, and
    she confessed the pleasure she felt in again meeting him. She extended her
    hand to him with a cordial smile, for she had not yet learned to hide her
    feelings under the mask of indifference.
  </p>
  <p>
    “I come from your father, my dear Emily. He is not very well, and feels the
    want of your kindness and good nursing.”
  </p>
  <p>
    “But where is my ———mother?” she enquired, hesitatingly. “She is obliged to
    divide her attentions between him and your little brother, who has been
    sometime ill, of a lingering complaint, which they fear will terminate in a
    consumption. But are you quite willing to forget your resentment?” “I have
    none.” “Your injuries then?” “I freely forgive them as I hope to be forgiven.”
  </p>
  <p>
    “Do you know their extent? Driven from your home, calumniated, disinherited,
    by one who pledged herself your friend.”
  </p>
  <p>
    While enumerating these, he closely watched her countenance, and finding there
    no expression but forgiving love, he continued, “or do you not feel their
    force?” An unbidden tear fell down her cheek, silently refuting the charge of
    insensibility.
  </p>
  <p>
    Love sprung in his heart spontaneous; and tenderly taking her hand, he said
    with much emotion, “Amiable girl!—have you no connection with earth, that you
    have divested yourself of human passions and frailties.”
  </p>
  <p>
    “Afflictions have been sanctified to me, and have taught me that hatred and
    happiness cannot exist in the same bosom.”
  </p>
  <p>
    “Matilda is my sister; forgive me, Emily! I believed what she said of you! I
    could almost <em>hate</em> her for <em>your</em> sake, had you not given me a better example.”
  </p>
  <p>
    “It is perfectly natural to believe the assertions of those we love; but I
    hope my study may be to contradict the tongue of slander by my conduct. Anger
    so blinds our reason, that Matilda might imagine me the unkind, guilty
    creature she represents me." Thus saying, she led the way to the house, where
    she introduced Edward to her aunt.
  </p>
  <p>The next morning found them at Mr. Minnette’s door.</p>
  <p>
    Edward remained in the parlor, that he might put no restraint upon the
    feelings of either party, while Emily was shown to her father’s room. She
    clung round his neck—he embraced her, and she once more felt happy in his
    returning love.
  </p>
  <p>
    The open door of an adjoining room discovered Matilda, bending over the bed of
    her sick child, with all a mother’s fondness in her looks. In her deep anxiety
    the predominant expression of unbending pride was lost; and instead, there
    seemed something like repentance, nay, even kindness as her eye rested on
    Emily.
  </p>
  <p>
    From this time, Emily divided her cares between her father and brother, and
    determined by her attentions to merit the love of her family. Perhaps she was
    more condescending than some, yet none thought her mean-spirited, or weak, or
    respected her the less; but all admired the forgiving spirit she displayed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Mr. Minnette soon recovered, which gave some reason to suspect that his
    disorder originated in remorse; and now, Emily transferred all her attentions
    to her suffering brother. She had, while with her aunt (who was the medical
    adviser of the whole village) acquired considerable knowledge of roots and
    herbs, and these she successfully employed in his recovery.
  </p>
  <p>
    Every day she carried the sufferer out of doors in her arms for the benefit of
    exercise and fresh air, of which Matilda, by a mistake in the art of nursing,
    had deprived him. He soon felt the good effect of the change, and the
    delighted mother saw once more the glow of health upon his cheek, and
    returning activity in his tiny limbs.
  </p>
  <p>
    Matilda’s haughty spirit had been broken down by adversity, and Emily’s
    conduct had shamed “the offending spirit” out of her. Her understanding was
    naturally good, but it had been perverted by a faulty education, dictated by
    an injudiciously fond parent. A train of concurring circumstances roused her
    better feelings and they triumphed over the errors of education and the
    habitual follies of many years! and she bent before the altar of her God, a
    repentant woman and a humble and sincere christian. And now, from being the
    most wretched, they became, proverbially, the most united and happy family in
    New-York. Having performed her duties at home, Emily, according to promise,
    returned to her aunt, accompanied by Edward, who by the consent of all parties
    had become her betrothed husband.
  </p>
  <p>
    “Let us be married, Emily,” said he, “on the anniversary of the river scene;
    then I shall unite in one the two most interesting events of my life, my
    marriage and the event which led to it.”
  </p>
  <p>
    A year from that day, Emily became the wife of Edward—and each succeeding one
    finds her in the midst of love and happiness surrounded by her family of
    little ones, to whom Edward annually repeats the Tale of Forgiveness.

  The author of this piece is unknown. This is the conclusion of a multi-part story. There are clear parallels between
  Emily and Prudence in terms of the piety involved in conducting a school
