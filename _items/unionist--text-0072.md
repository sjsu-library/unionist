scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: This ad ran continuously in <em>The Liberator</em> starting in March of
  1833. There are two notable changes in this only known appearance in <em>The Unionist</em>.
  William Lloyd Garrison and Arnold Buffum, both of whom were locally well-known as
  "outsiders" who were interfering with a local matter, have been dropped from the
  list of endorsers, in favor of Amos Phelps and Samuel Sewall. The “Rev.” in front
  of Cassey’s name a misprint. It is surprising that this ad is not reprinted in the
  later copies of <em>The Unionist</em>.<br>
