transcription: TATTLING. “He that keepeth his mouth, keepeth his life.” It is very
  common for<br>young persons to tell every thing they hear, whether they have any
  grounds for<br>the belief of what they hear or not. To the injury of an individual
  something<br>may be said and spread abroad, when there is not the least shadow of
  truth in<br>the story. And it is against this species of tattling which I wish to
  guard<br>mankind. The wise man knew how prone the world was to this sin when he
  said,—“he<br>that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life.” And truly that person who
  is careful<br>what he says—especially when he knows it is in his power to injure
  the character<br>of a person, or thwart any of his purposes—acts up to the proverb,
  and gains the<br>esteem and friendship of his fellows.—<br><em>Juvenile Watchman</em>
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: 'The <em>Juvenile Watchman</em> was a short-lived spin-off project of
  the Baptist newspaper, <em>Christian Watchman</em>. A remarkable Digital Humanities
  project [here] (https://www.merrycoz.org/bib/MAGAZINE.xhtml) includes a page tracking
  the lack of interest in this [periodical] (https://www.merrycoz.org/jwatch/RVJWATCH.xhtml#6). '
