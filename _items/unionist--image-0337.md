caption: 'This is one of the ugliest moments in the saga of the Canterbury Female
  Academy. Every sentence and word choice is poisoned by hatred, and disingenuously
  cloaking itself in feigned piety and self-righteousness. Consider the forthright
  declaration that a "determination has been formed to BREAK UP the negro school in
  Canterbury by some means or other" and then saying they don''t approve of it! Then
  there is the sexism directed at Prudence Crandall for daying to be "undisturbed"
  in her defiance of the will of the "people" (by which they mean white people with
  power). But it is the intersectional violence directed at the Black students, by
  calling them "wenches," that best reveals the feelings of the author(s). "Wench"
  is a term that carries with it low-class status, intemperance, and loose sexual
  morals. Now this article in the <em>Windham Advertiser</em> has added racism to
  the mix. Thus I felt that the best way, at this distant remove, to turn the joke
  back against its cruel makers, was to represent the wench by the dogs these accusers
  were. Unfortunately, these dogs are cute, and the authors of these rumors - which
  would come true, as is being noted here directly, in the January fire against the
  school - were not cure. They were, in fact, morally ugly. '
