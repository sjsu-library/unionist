transcription: "<em>Tin Roofs.</em>â€”The N.Y. Journal of Commerce informs us, that
  the practice of covering roofs <br>with tin instead of slate, is becoming quite
  extensive in that city. It is <br>estimated that no less than 300 have been thus
  covered [in] the present season. <br>In consequence of the removal of the 15 per
  cent, it is stated that tin is a <br>cheaper covering than slate. There is a considerable
  saving in timber and labor <br>in the construction of the roofs, as the tinned roofs
  are in general nearly <br>flat. Tin, it is said, is more durable than slate, and
  less liable to get out of <br>place or to be blown off by the wind. <br>"
