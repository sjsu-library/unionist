transcription: "<p>From the Windham County Advertiser</p> <p>   “In the last Norwich
  Republican, some remarks appear respecting the late fire   on the premises of Miss
  Crandall, in the course of which the editor of this   paper is alluded to in a manner
  that will, unless explained, greatly lessen   that confidence and respect, which
  we have hitherto cherished towards the   Republican, and our faith in the integrity
  of its editor. In the article of   which we speak, an “assertion” is attributed
  to us, which we never made,   either in public or in private. (a) it also falsely
  states that we have   declined making any disavowal” of a knowledge of the [indecipherable]
  \  “affair.” Such a disavowal <em>has</em> been made, in a letter to Miss Crandall,
  which has since been published. (b)   The Republican had better search for <em>facts,</em>
  before it asserts any thing on the authority of the Unionist; (c) and when those
  facts are found, the writer of the article of which we complain, will be made fully
  acquainted with the injustice he has done us. (d) </p> <p>   (a)We have not the
  Advertiser at our command in which the assertion referred   to, is published. Consequently
  we are not convinced that we were mistaken. </p> <p>   (b)We are rejoiced to hear
  this. Such disavowal have never met our eye,   although we seldom fail to give the
  Advertiser a thorough examination. </p> <p>   (c) At present we entertain a good
  opinion of Messrs. Burleighs. Their paper   (the Unionist) aside from its practical
  character, appears to be conducted   with much discernment. Its junior editor, Mr.
  Wm. Burleigh was taught the   rudiments of printing by ourself—and notwithstanding
  his disobedience caused   us to discharge him form our employ, yet commands our
  respect. He appears to   be possessed of talents, which, with proper cultivation,
  may enable him to   obtain an enviable reputation. Give “the devil his due,” is
  an old saying,   brother Holbrook. </p> <p>   (d)We are sorry, very sorry, if any
  remarks of ours have caused thee to feel   unpleasant. We can truly say that nothing
  was more foreign from our   intentions. Help us to the “facts,” brother, and they
  shall be duly published   in the Republican.” </p> "
