  <p>THE YOUNG MANâ€™S GUIDE.</p>
  <p>
    A VOLUME of 320 pages, designed as a cheap manual for Young Men, though it is
    believed to embrace much useful information to persons in every description;
    especially parents. It is divided into seven chapters; to which are prefixed a
    very full table o contents and an introduction. The great object of the author
    of the work, who has had much experience with youth, is to stimulate them to
    aim at a high standard of character, and to make the mental, social, and moral
    improvement o themselves and those around them, a governing purpose of their
    lives.
