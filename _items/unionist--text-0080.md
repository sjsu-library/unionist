  COMMERCE OF CHINA. For more than a century past, almost the whole of European
  trade has been restricted to Canton and Macao. But it was not always so. At
  different times during the reign of the Ming dynasty, the ports of Ningpo and
  Chusan in Chekeang, and the port of Amoy in Fuhkeen, were opened to Europeans,
  and became large marts for their commerce. Kanghe in the twenty third year of
  his reign opened all the ports of his empire, and allowed a
  <em>free trade</em> to his own subjects and to all foreign nations. This regulation continued in
  force for about thirty years. But at length it was argued against this
  regulation, that foreigners and adventurous Chinese who were living abroad would
  improverish the country by exporting large quantities of rice! For this, or some
  other reasons equally cogent, foreign trade was restricted; the emigration of
  natives and the ingress of foreigners, were prohibited; and, if we mistake not,
  the building of vessels on the European model was likewise interdicted. â€”
