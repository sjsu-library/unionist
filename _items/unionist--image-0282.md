caption: 'This drawing of Crandall in prison portrays her as being Quaker (which she
  no longer was), as being alone (Anna Benson was with her), and with her hair cut
  as if she was going to be beheaded! But it was exactly this sort of outrage that
  fueled many of the articles in the compendium that follows - the imprisonment of
  a woman for the crime of teaching, struck a deep chord of disbelief and indignation. '
