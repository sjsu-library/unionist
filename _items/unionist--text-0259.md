scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: 'Benjamin Watkins Leigh (1781-1849) was an anti-Abolitionist. In 1835
  he would contend that Virginia had a right to ban any literature it found "inflammatory."
  Apparently the Abolitionists already knew who his true colors. See Susan Dunn, <br><em>Dominion
  of Memories: Jefferson, Madison, and the decline of Virginia.</em>New York: Basic
  Books, 2007, p. 195 – “Virginia Senator Benjamin Watkins Leigh <br>proposed a statewide
  boycott of newspapers that favored emancipation. <br>Virginians, Leigh wrote, had
  the right “to suppress to the utmost of our power <br>what we deem inflammatory,
  dangerous, mischievous.” <br>'
