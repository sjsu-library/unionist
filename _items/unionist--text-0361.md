transcription: "<p> Dr. Johnson having formed one at a whist party at Mrs. Thrale’s
  house, was asked by the lady at the close of the evening, whether he had lost any
  thing. “Nothing but my time,” replied the moralist. </p> <p></p> "
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: Hester Thrale was a good friend of Samuel Johnson; they also had a famous
  falling-out; after Johnson's death, Thrale published their letters. An interesting
  choice of anecdote here!
