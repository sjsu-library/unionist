transcription: "<p><em>Miss Crandall's School.</em> - It is stated, we perceive, in
  some of the New York papers, that Miss Crandall has dismissed her school in consequence
  of the result of the late trial. We can inform our friends in New York, that there
  is no truth in the report, but that on the contrary, considerable accessions have
  been made to the number of her scholars since the trial. She will not abandon the
  prosecution of her benevolent plan, till it is fully settled by the competent tribunal
  that the law against it is constitutuonal. Should the event ever take place, as
  we trust it will not, she will then doubtless, like a good citizen submit to the
  law, however unjust and oppressive, till the people redeem the statue book from
  its disgrace.--<em>Brooklyn (Con.) Unionist.</em>"
