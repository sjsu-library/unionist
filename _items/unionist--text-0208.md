  SOCIETY</strong>   , </p> <p align="center"><em>Continued</em></p> <p>   IV. Laws
  which authorize the licensing of men to traffic in ardent spirit,   violate the
  first principles of political economy, and are highly injurious to   the wealth
  of a nation. </p> <p>   The wealth of a nation consists of the wealth of all the
  individuals that   compose it. The sources of wealth are labor, land, and capital.
  The last is   indeed the product of the two former; but as it may be used to increase
  their   value, it is considered by writers on political economy, as one of the   original
  sources of national wealth. Whatever lessons either of these, or   their productiveness
  when employed upon each other, lessens the wealth of the   country. Capital may
  be employed in two ways; either to produce new capital,   or merely to afford gratification,
  and in the production of that gratification   he consumed, without repealing its
  value. The first may be called capital, and   the last expenditure. These will of
  course bear inverse proportions to each   other. If the first be large, the last
  must be small, and vice versa. Without   any change of the amount of wealth, capital
  will be increased by the lessened   by the increase of expenditure. Although the
  manner of dividing makes no   difference with the present amount of national wealth,
  it makes great   difference with the future amount; as it alters materially the
  sources of   producing it, the means of an equal, or increased reproduction. </p>
  <p>   For instance, a man fond of noise and excited agreeably by the hearing of
  it,   pays a dollar for gunpowder, and touches fire to it. He occasions an entire   loss
  of that amount of property. Although the powder maker and the merchant,   may both
  have received their pay, if it has not benefitted the man, to him it   has been
  a total loss; and if the sale of it was more profitable than would   have been the
  sale of some useful article, it has been an entire loss to the   community. And
  if by the explosion the man is burnt, partially loses his   reason, is taken off
  a time from business, and confined by sickness to his   bed, must have nurses, physicians,
  &amp;c. the loss is still increased. And if   he never recovers fully his health,
  or reason, suffers his social affections   and moral sensibility, becomes less faithful
  in the education of his children,   and they are more exposed to temptation and
  ruin, and he is never again as   able or willing to be habitually employed in productive
  labor, the nation   loses equal to the amount of all these put together. And if
  his example leads   other men to spend, and to suffer in the same way, the loss
  is still farther   increased; and so on, through all its effects. </p> <p>   And
  even though the powder maker and the merchant have made enormous profit,   this
  does not prevent the loss to the community; any more than the profit of   lottery
  gamblers, or counterfeiters of the public coin, prevents loss to the   community.
  Nor does it meet the case, to say that the property changes hands.   This is not
  true. The man who sold the powder made a profit of only a part   even of the money
  which the other man paid for it; while he lost not only the   whole, but vastly
  more. The whole of the original cost was only a small part   of the loss to the
  buyer, and for the nation. The merchant gained nothing of   the time, and other
  numerous expenses, which the buyer lost; nor does he in   any way remunerate the
  community for that loss. </p> <p>   Suppose that man, instead of buying the powder,
  had bought a pair of shoes;   and that the tanner and the shoemaker had gained in
  this case, what the   powder-maker and the merchant gained in the other; and that
  by the use of the   shoes, though they were finally worn out, the man gained twice
  as much as he   gave for them; without any loss of health, or reason, social affection,
  or   moral susceptibility; and without any of the consequent evils.—Who cannot see   that
  it would have increased his wealth, and that of the nation, without   injury to
  any, and have promoted the benefit of all. </p> <p>   This illustrates the principle
  with regard to ardent spirit. A man buys a   quantity of it, and drinks it; when
  he would be, as the case with every man,   in all respects better without it. It
  is to him an entire loss. The merchant   may have made a profit of one quarter of
  the cost, but the buyer loses the   whole; and he loses the time employed in obtaining
  and drinking it. He loses,   also, and the community loses, equal to all its deteriorating
  effects upon his   body and mind, his children, and all who come under his influence.
  His land   becomes less productive. The capital of course produced by this land
  and labor   is diminished; and thus the means are diminished of future reproduction.
  And   by the increase of expenditure in proportion to the capital, it is still   farther
  diminished, till to meet the increasingly disproportionate expenses,   the whole
  is often taken, and the means of future reproduction are entirely   exhausted. And
  if there is no seed to sow, there is of course no future   harvest. This is but
  a simple history of what is taking in thousands of cases   continually; and of what
  is the tendency of the traffic in ardent spirit from   beginning to end. It lessens
  the productiveness of land and labor, and of   course diminishes the amount of capital;
  while in proportion, it increases the   expenditure, and thus in both ways is constantly
  exhausting the means of   future production. And this is its tendency, in all its
  bearing, in proportion   to the quantity used, from the man who takes only his glass,
  to the man who   takes his quart a day. It is a palpable and gross violation of
  all correct   principles of political economy; and from beginning to end, tends
  to diminish   all the sources of national wealth. </p> '
scholarlyNotes: 'Might we be sensing William''s influence here? The word “diminish”
  is twice spelled “dimish” in this last paragraph. I corrected that in this transcription. '
commentary: This is a continuation from previous editions of the paper. Because I
  cannot tell what <em>The Unionist</em> would have excerpted, I have not included
  any more of it at this time. This particular excerpt buttresses my published contention
  that the students at the Canterbury Female Academy were reading advanced philosophy.
  While I disagree with the political economic analysis forwarded here, it is sophisticated
  for its time. The meeting of the American Temperance Society was held in May 1833,
  and the publication came out of Boston. This particular excerpt begins on p. 46
  of the pamphlet, near the bottom of the page, through p. 48, most of the way down
  the page; the text can be found online here - https://dl.mospace.umsystem.edu/umsl/islandora/object/umsl%3A202880#page/1/mode/2up
