transcription: <p align="center">  SIXTH REPORT OF THE AMERICAN <br>  <strong>TEMPERANCE
  SOCIETY</strong>  , <br></p><p align="center"><em>Continued</em></p><p>  IV. Laws
  which authorize the licensing of men to traffic in ardent spirit, <br>  violate
  the first principles of political economy, and are highly injurious to <br>  the
  wealth of a nation. <br></p><p>  The wealth of a nation consists of the wealth of
  all the individuals that <br>  compose it. The sources of wealth are labor, land,
  and capital. The last is <br>  indeed the product of the two former; but as it may
  be used to increase their <br>  value, it is considered by writers on political
  economy, as one of the <br>  original sources of national wealth. Whatever lessons
  either of these, or <br>  their productiveness when employed upon each other, lessens
  the wealth of the <br>  country. Capital may be employed in two ways; either to
  produce new capital, <br>  or merely to afford gratification, and in the production
  of that gratification <br>  he consumed, without repealing its value. The first
  may be called capital, and <br>  the last expenditure. These will of course bear
  inverse proportions to each <br>  other. If the first be large, the last must be
  small, and vice versa. Without <br>  any change of the amount of wealth, capital
  will be increased by the lessened <br>  by the increase of expenditure. Although
  the manner of dividing makes no <br>  difference with the present amount of national
  wealth, it makes great <br>  difference with the future amount; as it alters materially
  the sources of <br>  producing it, the means of an equal, or increased reproduction.
  <br></p><p>  For instance, a man fond of noise and excited agreeably by the hearing
  of it, <br>  pays a dollar for gunpowder, and touches fire to it. He occasions an
  entire <br>  loss of that amount of property. Although the powder maker and the
  merchant, <br>  may both have received their pay, if it has not benefitted the man,
  to him it <br>  has been a total loss; and if the sale of it was more profitable
  than would <br>  have been the sale of some useful article, it has been an entire
  loss to the <br>  community. And if by the explosion the man is burnt, partially
  loses his <br>  reason, is taken off a time from business, and confined by sickness
  to his <br>  bed, must have nurses, physicians, &amp;c. the loss is still increased.
  And if <br>  he never recovers fully his health, or reason, suffers his social affections
  <br>  and moral sensibility, becomes less faithful in the education of his children,
  <br>  and they are more exposed to temptation and ruin, and he is never again as
  <br>  able or willing to be habitually employed in productive labor, the nation
  <br>  loses equal to the amount of all these put together. And if his example leads
  <br>  other men to spend, and to suffer in the same way, the loss is still farther
  <br>  increased; and so on, through all its effects. <br></p><p>  And even though
  the powder maker and the merchant have made enormous profit, <br>  this does not
  prevent the loss to the community; any more than the profit of <br>  lottery gamblers,
  or counterfeiters of the public coin, prevents loss to the <br>  community. Nor
  does it meet the case, to say that the property changes hands. <br>  This is not
  true. The man who sold the powder made a profit of only a part <br>  even of the
  money which the other man paid for it; while he lost not only the <br>  whole, but
  vastly more. The whole of the original cost was only a small part <br>  of the loss
  to the buyer, and for the nation. The merchant gained nothing of <br>  the time,
  and other numerous expenses, which the buyer lost; nor does he in <br>  any way
  remunerate the community for that loss. <br></p><p>  Suppose that man, instead of
  buying the powder, had bought a pair of shoes; <br>  and that the tanner and the
  shoemaker had gained in this case, what the <br>  powder-maker and the merchant
  gained in the other; and that by the use of the <br>  shoes, though they were finally
  worn out, the man gained twice as much as he <br>  gave for them; without any loss
  of health, or reason, social affection, or <br>  moral susceptibility; and without
  any of the consequent evils.—Who cannot see <br>  that it would have increased his
  wealth, and that of the nation, without <br>  injury to any, and have promoted the
  benefit of all. <br></p><p>  This illustrates the principle with regard to ardent
  spirit. A man buys a <br>  quantity of it, and drinks it; when he would be, as the
  case with every man, <br>  in all respects better without it. It is to him an entire
  loss. The merchant <br>  may have made a profit of one quarter of the cost, but
  the buyer loses the <br>  whole; and he loses the time employed in obtaining and
  drinking it. He loses, <br>  also, and the community loses, equal to all its deteriorating
  effects upon his <br>  body and mind, his children, and all who come under his influence.
  His land <br>  becomes less productive. The capital of course produced by this land
  and labor <br>  is diminished; and thus the means are diminished of future reproduction.
  And <br>  by the increase of expenditure in proportion to the capital, it is still
  <br>  farther diminished, till to meet the increasingly disproportionate expenses,
  <br>  the whole is often taken, and the means of future reproduction are entirely
  <br>  exhausted. And if there is no seed to sow, there is of course no future <br>  harvest.
  This is but a simple history of what is taking in thousands of cases <br>  continually;
  and of what is the tendency of the traffic in ardent spirit from <br>  beginning
  to end. It lessens the productiveness of land and labor, and of <br>  course diminishes
  the amount of capital; while in proportion, it increases the <br>  expenditure,
  and thus in both ways is constantly exhausting the means of <br>  future production.
  And this is its tendency, in all its bearing, in proportion <br>  to the quantity
  used, from the man who takes only his glass, to the man who <br>  takes his quart
  a day. It is a palpable and gross violation of all correct <br>  principles of political
  economy; and from beginning to end, tends to diminish <br>  all the sources of national
  wealth. <br></p>
scholarlyNotes: 'Might we be sensing William''s influence here? The word “diminish”
  is twice spelled “dimish” in this last paragraph. I corrected that in this transcription. '
commentary: This is a continuation from previous editions of the paper. Because I
  cannot tell what <em>The Unionist</em> would have excerpted, I have not included
  any more of it at this time. This particular excerpt buttresses my published contention
  that the students at the Canterbury Female Academy were reading advanced philosophy.
  While I disagree with the political economic analysis forwarded here, it is sophisticated
  for its time. The meeting of the American Temperance Society was held in May 1833,
  and the publication came out of Boston. This particular excerpt begins on p. 46
  of the pamphlet, near the bottom of the page, through p. 48, most of the way down
  the page; the text can be found online here - https://dl.mospace.umsystem.edu/umsl/islandora/object/umsl%3A202880#page/1/mode/2up
