transcription: "<p>  <em>Canterbury decency exemplified.</em>  —It may not be known
  to many of our readers that the Junior editor of this<br>  paper (W.H. Burleigh)
  has, for several weeks past, been engaged as an<br>  instructor in Miss Crandall’s
  school. Such, however, is the fact. We did not<br>  pause to enquire whether the<br>
  \ <em>benevolent</em>  and<br>  <em>christian</em>  people of Canterbury would be
  pleased or displeased with it—or what other<br>  people might say or think about
  it—the conviction that we could<br>  be&nbsp; useful—that we could by our influence,
  limited though it be, and by<br>  our example and by our labors&nbsp; assist in
  the moral and intellectual<br>  elevation of a race long and grievously oppressed,
  was sufficient to<br>  induce us to take the step we have taken. We knew the shameful
  persecutions<br>  which Miss Crandall had endured, and were ready to expect that
  we also might<br>  receive a share of obloquy. We are willing to receive the censure
  of a certain<br>  class. The hate of the bad is the highest commendation a good
  man can receive.<br></p><p>  On Tuesday evening last, as we were returning after
  the labors of the<br>  day, to our lodgings about a quarter of a mile south of the
  village, we were<br>  saluted, when opposite the house of an opposer of the school,
  by a volley of<br>  addled eggs. They poured in upon us like grape shot from a seventy-four—but<br>
  \ luckily no one hit us. The miscreants who made the assault were concealed,<br>
  \ like cowards, behind the wall, and owing to this and the dimness of the night,<br>
  \ we were unable to discern any one. We quickened our pace, and was soon beyond<br>
  \ the reach of the&nbsp; missiles. As we passed the barn of the individual above<br>
  \ referred to, however, we perceived that the great door fronting&nbsp; the<br>
  \ street was wide open, and we made up our mind to receive another volley from<br>
  \ the garrison which we had reason to suspect was within. Nor were we<br>  disappointed.
  Canterbury arguments, in the shape of addled eggs, again poured<br>  in upon us;
  but we passed rapidly on, and were soon beyond their reach. We<br>  know not how
  it happened, but for some reason we escaped untouched, though<br>  many were thrown
  and some struck very near us.<br></p><p>  We have a few remarks to make upon this
  shameful and unprovoked attack. To say<br>  it is in perfect keeping with the past
  course of Canterburians is to say<br>  nothing new. When fathers offer to help tear
  down the house, and assert that<br>  they had rather their children should go to
  hell, than to go to school to Miss<br>  C. in case she should ever take a white
  school again—when fathers conspire<br>  together to starve the school out, and reckless
  miscreants are thus encouraged<br>  to attempt to burn it out—when fathers look
  with complacency, nay,<br>  with delight upon the depredations already made on Miss
  C’s property—it<br>  is not to be wondered at that their children, previously depraved
  as they are,<br>  should venture in the darkness of the night to attack an unarmed
  individual<br>  who was known not only to<br>  <em>favor</em>  Miss C’s project,
  but to<br>  <em>assist</em>  her in the accomplishment of her designs. We are not
  disappointed. Addled eggs<br>  are fit instruments for such people—and such people,
  when engaged in robbing<br>  their neighbor’s hen-roosts to obtain them, and afterwards
  skulking behind<br>  the walls and in the barns to throw them at the passer by,
  are<br>  engaged in an avocation for which their capacities seem to be peculiarly<br>
  \ adapted. We envy them not the distinction which they will inevitably acquire.<br>
  \ But it would become the parents of such promising youths, if, instead of<br>  casting
  impediments in the way of the instruction of others, they would<br>  instruct their
  own children in good morals and good manners, and if they<br>  cannot render them<br>
  \ <em>useful,</em>  at least render them<br>  <em>decent</em>  . A portion of their
  leisure time devoted to the laudable object of checking<br>  the precocious depravity
  of their offspring, may save them the future<br>  anguish of witnessing that offspring
  dangling from the gallows. We hope our<br>  advice will be taken kindly by Canterbury
  people.<br></p><p>  This article is intended for those only whom it fits. No others
  will<br>  understand us as meaning them. We cannot forbear adding, however, as a
  quieter<br>  to the vague fears of the parents of Canterbury, that there can be
  no danger<br>  of their sons ever marrying any of the colored girls of Miss C’s
  school<br>  even if they were so inclined. They must become far more refined, in<br>
  \ mind and in manners, before they would be able to come in competition<br>  with
  the most ignorant and least refined scholar in school.<br></p>"
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: The linguistic similarities between this full letter, and Garrison's summary
  in the previous edition of <em>The Liberator</em> leads me to believe that the full
  article was in <em>The Unionist</em> of June 12, 1834.
