transcription: "<p> <em>Canterbury decency exemplified.</em> —It may not be known
  to many of our readers that the Junior editor of this paper (W.H. Burleigh) has,
  for several weeks past, been engaged as an instructor in Miss Crandall’s school.
  Such, however, is the fact. We did not pause to enquire whether the <em>benevolent</em>
  and <em>christian</em> people of Canterbury would be pleased or displeased with
  it—or what other people might say or think about it—the conviction that we could
  be useful—that we could by our influence, limited though it be, and by our example
  and by our labors assist in the moral and intellectual elevation of a race long
  and grievously oppressed, was sufficient to induce us to take the step we have taken.
  We knew the shameful persecutions which Miss Crandall had endured, and were ready
  to expect that we also might receive a share of obloquy. We are willing to receive
  the censure of a certain class. The hate of the bad is the highest commendation
  a good man can receive. </p> <p> On Tuesday evening last, as we were returning after
  the labors of the day, to our lodgings about a quarter of a mile south of the village,
  we were saluted, when opposite the house of an opposer of the school, by a volley
  of addled eggs. They poured in upon us like grape shot from a seventy-four—but luckily
  no one hit us. The miscreants who made the assault were concealed, like cowards,
  behind the wall, and owing to this and the dimness of the night, we were unable
  to discern any one. We quickened our pace, and was soon beyond the reach of the&nbsp;
  missiles. As we passed the barn of the individual above referred to, however, we
  perceived that the great door fronting the street was wide open, and we made up
  our mind to receive another volley from the garrison which we had reason to suspect
  was within. Nor were we disappointed. Canterbury arguments, in the shape of addled
  eggs, again poured in upon us; but we passed rapidly on, and were soon beyond their
  reach. We know not how it happened, but for some reason we escaped untouched, though
  many were thrown and some struck very near us. </p> <p> We have a few remarks to
  make upon this shameful and unprovoked attack. To say it is in perfect keeping with
  the past course of Canterburians is to say nothing new. When fathers offer to help
  tear down the house, and assert that they had rather their children should go to
  hell, than to go to school to Miss C. in case she should ever take a white school
  again—when fathers conspire together to starve the school out, and reckless miscreants
  are thus encouraged to attempt to burn it out—when fathers look with complacency,
  nay, with delight upon the depredations already made on Miss C’s property—it is
  not to be wondered at that their children, previously depraved as they are, should
  venture in the darkness of the night to attack an unarmed individual who was known
  not only to <em>favor</em> Miss C’s project, but to <em>assist</em> her in the accomplishment
  of her designs. We are not disappointed. Addled eggs are fit instruments for such
  people—and such people, when engaged in robbing their neighbor’s hen-roosts to obtain
  them, and afterwards skulking behind the walls and in the barns to throw them at
  the passer by, are engaged in an avocation for which their capacities seem to be
  peculiarly adapted. We envy them not the distinction which they will inevitably
  acquire. But it would become the parents of such promising youths, if, instead of
  casting impediments in the way of the instruction of others, they would instruct
  their own children in good morals and good manners, and if they cannot render them
  <em>useful,</em> at least render them <em>decent</em> . A portion of their leisure
  time devoted to the laudable object of checking the precocious depravity of their
  offspring, may save them the future anguish of witnessing that offspring dangling
  from the gallows. We hope our advice will be taken kindly by Canterbury people.
  </p> <p> This article is intended for those only whom it fits. No others will understand
  us as meaning them. We cannot forbear adding, however, as a quieter to the vague
  fears of the parents of Canterbury, that there can be no danger of their sons ever
  marrying any of the colored girls of Miss C’s school even if they were so inclined.
  They must become far more refined, in mind and in manners, before they would be
  able to come in competition with the most ignorant and least refined scholar in
  school. </p> "
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: The linguistic similarities between this full letter, and Garrison's summary
  in the previous edition of <em>The Liberator</em> leads me to believe that the full
  article was in <em>The Unionist</em> of June 12, 1834.
