scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: 'Sylvester Barrows (1801-1876) was a minister as well as a horticulturist.
  He had a distant relative, Ephraim P. Barrows Jr., who was a minister with connections
  to the New York City anti-slavery movement [Cole, Charles C. Jr.  1953.  The Free
  Church Movement in New York City.  New York History 34:3:284-297 (July 1953).].
  The sale of mulberry trees here is part of "Connecticut''s Great Mulberry Mania
  of the 1830s." This was an attempt to cultivate (literally) a home-grown silk industry
  in New England. See this article for more information - https://newenglandhistoricalsociety.com/connecticuts-great-mulberry-mania-1830s/ '
