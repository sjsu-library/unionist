scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: 'Ebenezer Griffin (1775-1860) is almost certainly the same man who was
  one of the presiding judges at Crandall''s first trial under the Black Law, and
  then again at Frederick Olney''s trials; the full trial transcripts of both trials
  are available in this database. His stance on slavery and abolition at the time
  of Canterbury are unknown, but he is noted as a conductor on the Underground Railroad,
  in Hampton (in Windham county) by Horatio T. Strother, <em>The Underground Railroad
  in Connecticut</em>, (Middletown CT: Wesleyan University Press, 1962), p. 211.'
