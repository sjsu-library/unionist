transcription: We are sorry to hear that some evil disposed, or heedlessly mischievous
  person has circulated a story, that our office has been entered with violence, and
  our types &amp;c. broken, destroyed, or scattered about the building and the streets.
  We hope the story has gained no more credence than it deserves, for to believe it,
  would be great injustice to the quiet and orderly people of Brooklyn. We would humbly
  hope moreover, that our contemplated course is not so displeasing to the people
  as to excite them to such an action even if they were,—as we are sure they are not—disposed
  to adopt violent measures to serve their ends. The indications of public favor which
  we have already perceived, encourage us to believe, that so far from being put down
  by force, we shall be sustained by the countenance and patronage of a candid (not
  “credulous”) community.
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: 'The fact that Burleigh denies there was an attack on the office suggests
  his honesty, rather than attempt to gain sympathy by pretending there was an attack. '
