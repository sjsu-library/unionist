transcription: This transaction will stand in future ages as a blot upon that<br><em>free</em>state
  and our land of<br><em>freedom</em>—a strange and foul blot for the 19<br><sup>th</sup>century.
  Future generations will doubtless be as much astonished at it, as the<br>present
  is at reading the accounts of the trials and executions of witches in<br>New-England.”
