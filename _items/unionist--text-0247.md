transcription: <p align="center">HIGHLY IMPORTANT.</p><p>  A letter from Louisville,
  Kentucky, received in this city, yesterday, states<br>  that on the day it was written,
  Committee of Directors of the Louisville Bank,<br>  which has hitherto been a depository
  of the Government funds, called at the<br>  Branch Bank and laid upon the counter
  about $100,000 of specie and notes<br>  belonging to the Government. They accompanied
  this movement by an explanation<br>  that their Bank had resolved to touch no more
  the Treasury Funds—that the sum<br>  brought was all they then held—and from that
  time their connection with the<br>  Government must cease.<br></p><p>  They remarked
  also, that they should leave the money in the branch, hoping<br>  they would consent
  to take care of it, for that upon no consideration would<br>  they permit it to
  return to their vaults. So much for the glorious experiment.<br>  “By St Paul, the
  work goes bravely on,” The people have said no to the<br>  experiment, and now even
  the pet banks begin to denounce the folly and<br>  impotence of the greatest and
  best.—<br>  <em>Star-spangled-Banner.</em></p>
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: The phrase “By St Paul, the work goes bravely on" is credited to English
  actor, Poet Laureate, and fop Colley Cibber (1671-1757), from his play <em>Richard
  III</em>, Act III, Scene 1. Colley was mercilessly pilloried by Alexander Pope in
  the latter's <em>Dunciad</em>. For more on Cibber, see this web post from a theater
  historian Evangeline Van Houten, https://dilettantearmy.com/articles/colley-cibber
