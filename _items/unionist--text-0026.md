transcription: We confess having spoken without sufficient reflection, in saying that
  the Advertiser is <em>bound by</em> express promises. We now amend; by substituting
  for that complained of, the assertion that the Advertiser <em>has made</em> an express
  promise in respect to the course he should pursue. We allude to his promising admission
  to communications on both sides of the Canterbury question, a promise of which we
  presume he will not require the “measurement,” since he has, by assigning his reasons
  for so doing, admitted having made and revoked it. But if he chooses to have it
  that he has made no express promises to conduct his paper "with that independence
  and fairness which ought to characterize a public journal," we are willing he should
  have it so, and if he prefers to set in such a manner as shows that he considers
  himself under no implied obligation to that fairness, why! Let him so act. But really,
  we did not expect he would publicly take exceptions to our declaration, that he
  is bound to conduct with that “fairness which <em>ought to characterize</em> a public
  journal.”
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: As is true in today's media environment, the promise to represent "all
  sides" is often made disingenuously.
