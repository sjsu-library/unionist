  THE EVENING CLOUD.</p><p>See yonder cloud along the west,</p><p>In gay, fantastic
  slendour dress’d,</p><p>Fancy’s bright visions charm the eye,</p><p>Sweet fairy
  bowers in prospect lie,</p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Deck’d in<br>  the hues of even!<br></p><p>But short its evanescent stay,</p><p>Its
  brilliant masses fade away,</p><p>The breeze floats off its visions gay,</p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  And clears<br>  the face of Heaven.<br></p><p>  Thus to fond<br>  <em>man</em>  does
  life’s fair scene<br></p><p>Delusive spread its cheerful green:</p><p>Before his
  path sine pleasure’s bowers,</p><p>Each smiling field seems dressed in flowers,</p><p>  <em>Hope</em>  leads
  him on, and shows his hours<br></p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  For peace<br>  and pleasure given:<br></p><p>But one by one his hopes decay,</p><p>Each
  flattering vision fades away,</p><p>Each cheering scene charms to betray,</p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  And nought<br>  remains but Heaven.<br></p><p>  Windham, April<br>  21.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>  JULIA<br></p>
