transcription: "“Who pays?” asks the Advertiser. We of course feel deeply sensible
  of the honor done us by the solicitude our kind neighbor manifests about our affairs,
  and therefore instead of replying, (in the laconic style in which <em>we</em> should
  expect to be answered, were we to ask such questions,)—it is none of your business,—we
  will inform the Advertiser for his especial benefit, that we seriously think of
  adopting the novel expedient of requiring those to pay, who take the paper. If the
  people of this county and vicinity choose to support our paper it will go on, if
  not, then to calm the fears of our self-appointed guardian, we assure him, that
  we have no intention of continuing it. We are somewhat at a loss to discover how
  our neighbor is so much better acquainted with our business, than we are, but his
  assertion that no arrangements have been made to prepare subscribers for this paper,
  is either a proof that he is so, or another evidence of his happy talent, for manufacturing
  facts. Had he not given us this information, (which is certainly as new to us as
  anything contained in his sheet,) we should have firmly believed that we <em>had</em>
  made “arrangements to procure subscribers,” nay more, that our arrangements had
  not been wholly ineffectual. But if the Advertiser knows better, why! We must be
  mistaken, that’s all."
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: The Unionist received considerable financial backing from the wealthy
  New York merchant and Abolitionist Arthur Tappan. This connection appeared suspicious
  to James Holbrook of the Windham Advertiser, who made insinuations against The Unionist
  as a result. This is Burleigh's reply to these attacks.
