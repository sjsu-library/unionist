    In presenting to the public the October number of the LADY’S BOOK, the
    Proprietors feel much pleasure in inviting attention to a comparison between
    it and the preceding numbers. It will be perceived that a gradual, but decided
    improvement, has been effected in its embellishments; particularly in the
    department of costume fashions, which have been executed by KELLY; an artist
    who, in the Embellishment which accompanies this, has literally excelled
    himself; rendering the prints of Fashions of the LADY’S BOOK sufficiently
    excellent to compete with the best executed in London, and to surpass those of
    Paris. Hence, the public will perceive that the hopes of progressive
    improvement, which the proprietors of the Lady’s Book have expressed to their
    patrons, have been fully realized.
  </p>
  <p>
    A very material change is observable in the reading department of the Lady’s
    Book which improvement will proceed, to, at least, be sustained, by the
    exertions of its contributors; and, as a further expression of their gratitude
    to a patronizing community, the publication for January, 1834, will contain
    twenty-four additional pages, and the whole number will be exclusively devoted
    to and composed of ORIGINAL subjects—every article written expressly for the
    work.
  </p>
  <p>
    Among the contributors on this occasion may be enumerated Miss Leslie, author
    of the Prize Tale entitled “Mrs. Washington Potts”—Mrs. Hentz, author of the
    Prize Tragedy—the late Mrs. Gilbert—Joseph R. Chandler, Esq.—J.A. Shea, author
    of Adolph, Address to the Ocean, &amp;c.—the author of “A Tale of Fashionable
    Life”­—the author of “Sketches of a Jurist-Consult”—Y.P.—A.E.—and other
    well-known and popular writers, whose productions have given so peculiar a
    delight to the readers of the Lady’s Book. This publication has been always
    distinguished for its beautiful engravings of the Fashions, but it is the
    intention of the proprietors to render the one for January still more splendid
    than the previous ones. The public will perceive that, without heralding it by
    professions, a reference to past experience is the best promise of future
    exertions, which it shall be the publishers’ study to render both prompt and
    pleasing.
