  <em>Ten miles of Paper.</em>
  —Paper used to be sold by the sheet, the quire, or the ream;&nbsp; but in “the
  march of improvement,” stationary will not remain stationary, and so it is now
  sold by measure. The following order was received from a pottery firm the other
  day. The writer, it will be observed, gives his orders with as much indifference
  as though they were not at all extraordinary:—“Gentlemen—Please to send us ten
  miles of your best printing tissue paper, in length; 6 miles to be 30 inches
  broad, 4 miles 22 inches broad—to be wrapped on wooden rollers, according to the
  plan given to Mr. George Fourdrinier.” The object of having the paper of such
  great length is that it may be printed from engraved cylinders, in the same way
  as calicoes, &amp;c.
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: George Spafford and James Phelps in Windham in the 1830s were among the
  first Americans to use the [Fourdrinier machine.] (https://paper.gatech.edu/advent-paper-machine)
  More information on the Fourdrinier paper-machine can be found [on this website.]
