transcription: In an advertisement for  <br><em>The Life and Travels of the Apostle
  Paul</em> a sentence is cited from <br><em>The Unionist</em>. It states “The work
  has undergone a careful revision from the&nbsp; English edition, and <br>may be
  considered a valuable addition to Sabbath School literature” <br> <br> <br>
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: 'As with the previous entry, it is not clear that the quote from <em>The
  Unionist</em> is really from a "review" - it formed part of the copy in the advertisement
  for the book in the December 19, 1833 issue! This review was republished numerous
  times in the <em>Christian Register</em>: 1834-01-25; 1834-02-22; 1834-03-08; 1834-04-12'
