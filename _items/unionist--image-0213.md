description: '"Political cartoon depicting Andrew Jackson as a despotic monarch. He
  tramples on the Constitution and the coat of arms of Pennsylvania, the location
  of the United States Bank. A book titled the Judiciary of the United States appears
  to be thrown aside. In his hand Jackson holds a veto, referring to Jackson''s veto
  of the Bank''s rechartering. The text links him with William IV, the reigning monarch
  of the United Kingdom. A classic of Jacksonian era political propaganda, this broadside
  illustrates the popular sentiments ("Shall he reign over us, or shall the PEOPLE
  RULE?") that led to the formation of the anti-Jackson Whig Party in Jackson''s own
  backyard." from https://teva.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p15138coll33/id/289/ '
