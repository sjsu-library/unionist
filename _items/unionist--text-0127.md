transcription: "<p>  <em>U.S. Deposits.</em>  —A writer in the Boston Daily Advertiser,
  who is evidently familiar with<br>  banking operations, shows by mathematical demonstration,
  that “The Government<br>  deposits, cannot be removed from the Bank of the United
  States, because there<br>  is no local Bank strong enough to take them, burthened
  as such a duty is with<br>  the obligation, on the part of such local Bank, to receive
  the bills of all<br>  the branches of the Bank of the United States and to pay out
  Gold and Silver,<br>  for the checks of the Government.” It is also stated that
  the proposed removal<br>  is illegal, and not within the power of the Executive.<br></p><p>The
  New York Commercial Advertiser contains the following paragraph:—</p><p>  “Of one
  thing we feel very strongly assured, and we wish well what we say. No<br>  matter
  what terms or conditions are offered by the local banks—<br>  <em>the deposits will
  not be removed.</em>  And further: No matter for the sentiments or the vetoes of
  the President,<br>  <em>the Charter of the Bank will one day be renewed.”</em></p><p></p>"
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: The political and economic crisis that preoccupied Andrew Jackson's second
  term as President was the controversy over the charter of The Bank of the United
  States. <em>The Unionist</em> predictably stood by the Bank against President Jackson,
  a perspective that was amplified when William Burleigh joined the editorial team
  by the end of 1833.
