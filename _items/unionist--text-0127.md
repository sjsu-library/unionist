    <em>U.S. Deposits.</em>
    —A writer in the Boston Daily Advertiser, who is evidently familiar with
    banking operations, shows by mathematical demonstration, that “The Government
    deposits, cannot be removed from the Bank of the United States, because there
    is no local Bank strong enough to take them, burthened as such a duty is with
    the obligation, on the part of such local Bank, to receive the bills of all
    the branches of the Bank of the United States and to pay out Gold and Silver,
    for the checks of the Government.” It is also stated that the proposed removal
    is illegal, and not within the power of the Executive.
  </p>
  <p>The New York Commercial Advertiser contains the following paragraph:—</p>
  <p>
    “Of one thing we feel very strongly assured, and we wish well what we say. No
    matter what terms or conditions are offered by the local banks—
    <em>the deposits will not be removed.</em>
    And further: No matter for the sentiments or the vetoes of the President,
    <em>the Charter of the Bank will one day be renewed.”</em>
  </p>

scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: The political and economic crisis that preoccupied Andrew Jackson's second
  term as President was the controversy over the charter of The Bank of the United
  States. <em>The Unionist</em> predictably stood by the Bank against President Jackson,
  a perspective that was amplified when William Burleigh joined the editorial team
  by the end of 1833.
