transcription: "<p>  “Judge Daggett.—This respected magistrate, we perceive, was not
  compelled, as<br>  we supposed, to sentence a Christian sister to an infamous punishment
  for the<br>  crime of teaching other Christian sisters the knowledge by which they
  could be<br>  qualified to do good to their class. The case was carried directly
  to the<br>  Court of Errors. The Hon. Judge, in giving his opinion in favor of the<br>
  \ <em>constitutionality</em>  of the “Black law” did not, as we learn by a private
  letter, commit himself to<br>  any opinion in favor of the law itself.<br></p><p>
  \ The question of constitutionality turned mainly upon this point, whether the<br>
  \ persons affected by the law are<br>  <em>citizens</em>  of the United States.
  The judge relied on the definition in Webster, that<br>  citizens are those who
  enjoy the elective franchise, and can hold real estate,<br>  and it has never been
  judicially decided that blacks can do this, or sue in<br>  the United States Courts.
  A writer in the “Unionist,” who seems to have<br>  examined the subject, shows that
  the right of suffrage may be exercised in<br>  New-Hampshire by male<br>  <em>inhabitants;</em>
  \ in Vt. By a<br>  <em>man;</em>  in Mass. By male<br>  <em>citizens,</em>  (under
  which term blacks have always voted, and one has held a seat as<br>  representative,)
  in R. I. by a<br>  <em>subject;</em>  in N.Y. blacks of certain qualifications can
  vote; in Pa. every<br>  <em>freeman,</em>  and the same in N.C. and Tenn. The constitutions
  of Md., Va. N.C. Ky. Ala.<br>  Miss. Mo. And Lou. Limit the right of voting to free<br>
  \ <em>white</em>  citizens, which would be superfluous unless blacks may be citizens.
  The same<br>  number of the Unionist contains extracts from speeches delivered in
  the<br>  convention of New-York, 1821, by such men as Peter A. Jay, James Kent,
  Rufus<br>  King, Abraham Van Vechten, all maintaining expressly that people of color
  are<br>  citizens. Also a letter from De Witt Clinton to President Adams in 1826,<br>
  \ claiming Gilbert Horton as ‘a citizen of this State,’ unlawfully imprisoned at<br>
  \ Washington.”<br></p>"
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: This confirms that Jay's letter - and his well-tuned legal arguments -
  appeared soon after the second trial.
