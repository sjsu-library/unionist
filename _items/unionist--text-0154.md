transcription: The Unionist has devoted something over three columns to our humble
  self. A<br>labor which the Editor might have well spared as he has neither overturned
  any<br>positions of ours, or established those of his own. If he supposes that we<br>desired
  “to be excused” from further discussion by any fear of his doughty self,<br>he may
  enjoy the illusion if it will afford him any pleasure—it was the<br>fatherest thing
  from our thoughts at the time. He may rest assured that we have<br>no greater claim
  to the character of Goliah,[sic] than he has to that of David.<br>He slings his
  stones too wide of his mark.<br>
