transcription: "In an advertisement for <em>Daughter’s Own Book, comprising letters
  from a Father to his Daughter.</em> six positive reviews are cited. The final one
  is cited as being from\n<em>The Unionist</em>: “It is the most valuable treatise
  that has been published, and we recommend it to every parent and daughter in our
  country.” \n\n"
scholarlyNotes: "One other review quotation of interest comes from \n<em>Zion’s Herald</em>,
  contending that the book\n“furnishes much excellent instruction on the culture and
  discipline of the\nfemale mind.”"
commentary: It is not clear that the quote from <em>The Unionist</em> is really from
  a "review" - it formed part of the copy in the advertisement for the book in the
  December 19, 1833 issue of <em>The Unionist</em>.
