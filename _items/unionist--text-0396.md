transcription: "<p>   “Some two or three&nbsp; weeks since we published, upon authority
  so   respectable as to have been considered altogether unquestionable, an account
  \  of the unwelcome reception of the Rev. Captain Stuart, of Great Britain, in   the
  town of Plainfield, Conn., together with a statement as to his rather   forcible
  expulsion from that place. It appears that the account received by us   was not
  altogether correct; but wherein it was incorrect, we have not been   able exactly
  to ascertain. But for the style of rudeness with which we have   been assailed upon&nbsp;
  this subject, we should have noted the inaccuracy of   the account communicated
  to us before, although we had not the means of   correcting it. All the papers contradicting
  our version of&nbsp; the affair,   have admitted that disturbances did&nbsp; attend
  Captain Stuart’s visit to   Plainfield, but have not informed us&nbsp; as to particulars.
  The   <em>Emancipator</em>   of yesterday, commences an article this:— </p> <p>
  \  “THE AFFAIR AT PLAINFIELD.—Our readers probably know that during the height of
  \  the late reign of terror in New York, the Editor of the N.Y. Commercial   Advertiser,
  “more the organ of the&nbsp; Colonization Society than any other   in this city,”
  endeavored to keep himself and his mob in countenance by a   ludicrous and apparently
  approving account of a mob said to have taken place   in Plainfield, Conn., in which
  the farmers of that place were described as   literally driving Charles Stuart out
  of town with their cart whips.   <em>The story was not true.</em>   —But it was
  true that some unmannerly boys attempted, without success, to   disturb the lecture.
  The following is extracted from an&nbsp; account given in   the Brooklyn (Ct.) Unionist:
  </p> <p>   “We have called them   <em>gentlemen,</em>   though had they been strangers
  to us, had we not been personally acquainted   with them, known their high pretensions,
  the respectability of their   parentage, their advantages for learning what belongs
  to the character of a   gentleman, and that on many occasions&nbsp; they show that
  they   <em>do</em>   know how to conduct with propriety, there is much reason to&nbsp;
  fear that   their disorderly behaviour, their indecency and rudeness of language
  and   action, would have led us to rank them with the lowest vulgar. As it is,   however,
  the graduate of Yale, the undergraduate of another college, the   students in the
  academy, the sons of wealthy and respectable citizens of   Plainfield, of church
  members and zealous colonizationists,   <em>     (for the parents of every Plainfield
  youth whom we {noted?] in the rabble,     are decided ‘Colonizationists’) must,
  we suppose, be called gentlemen, be     their conduct what it may.—   </em>   Much
  good may the name do them, and may they yet learn to deserve it, though   we fear
  ‘twill be a hard lesson for some of them, [undecipherable] any truth   in the maxims
  of moralists respecting the [undecipherable] </p> <p>   [undecipherable] than one
  exception, we   <em>know,</em>   and we think [undecipherable]{end of Unionist quote
  and, by implication, of   Emancipator quote} </p> <p>   Now in the first place,
  the introductory&nbsp; remarks of the Emancipator are   not true. Our account of
  the Plainfield disturbance   <em>was not</em>   published “during the height of
  the late reign of terror,” but when all was   tranquil in the week following [my
  note – it was published July 15   <sup>th</sup>   – notes in main PC file];—and
  in the second place, the account of the Brooklyn   Unionist, (an&nbsp; abolition
  paper published in the neighborhood of   Plainfield,) represents the case, if anything,
  more unfavorably than we   did.—Indeed our mistake seems to have consisted only
  in stating that the young   men cracked their whips while Mr. Stuart was forcibly
  placed in his waggon   (sic). Upon this point, then, we stand corrected. </p> <p>
  \  But a communication under the signature of Captain Stuart himself, which   appears
  in the Emancipator, with the prefatory remark that it “was refused   publication
  in the Commercial Advertiser,” calls for a few observations. It   was not because
  he attempted to correct an error into which it is   [indecipherable] fallen, that
  we objected to the publication of his   article—for that we would very cheerfully
  [indecipherable] done at any time.   Our objection arose not only from the inflammatory
  character of the   communication, as a while, but from a more weighty consideration
  still. We   entirely object to the visit of Captain Stuart among us, as being not
  only   uncalled for, but highly improper; and it would be the highth of imprudence
  \  for him, again to appear before the public, on the subject of his mission,   either
  in print, in the pulpit, or at the forum. He seems to be an amiable,   and we doubt
  not a good man; but he has no business in this country on such   an&nbsp; errand.
  How, for instance, would it be received for an American to   repair to England,
  for the purpose of delivering lectures in favor repealing   the Act of Union between
  England and Ireland! Such interference in the   internal affairs of another nation,
  would not be permitted, and any   <em>foreign agent</em>   attempting it, would
  very properly be prevented from opening his lips. The   principle, it will be seen,
  is precisely the same. </p> <p>   But Mr. Stuart, it appears, is not long to be
  the only agent from abroad,   engaged in the work of enlightening our country on
  the subject of its   own&nbsp; domestic and social relations. He is soon to be joined
  by a Mr.   Thompson, who is understood to be on his way hither&nbsp; as a Missionary
  from   some excellent ladies of Glasgow. Mr. Thompson is said to be an able and
  an   eloquent man; but we trust that on his arrival amongst us, he will perceive
  \  the propriety of withholding any displays, either of his talents or his   rhetoric,
  on the subject of his mission.—Indeed—and we say it deliberately,   though with
  all kindness—we hold that neither Mr. Stuart, nor Mr. Thompson,   nor any other
  strangers from abroad, should be permitted to convoke and   harangue an American
  assembly upon this question. We doubt not the goodness of   their intentions; but
  they are laboring under a sad mistake, as to the path of   duty. If they have feelings
  of kindness for the slaves of this country, let   them remain in their own; or else,
  if they choose, let them imitate a King and   a Van Rensselaer, and go among the
  slaves to preach the Gospel in a manner   compatible with the laws and usages of
  those States. The truth is, these   excellent, though misjudging, philanthropists,
  do not understand the real nad   inherent difficulties of the case, arising from
  the&nbsp; essential difference   in the structures of our respective governments.
  The British Constitution is   unwritten, consisting, in fact, of the common law
  of the realm. Parliament is   omnipotent; and it had a perfect right, politically
  speaking, to abolish the   slavery of its colonies at a blow, if it chose to do
  so.—Nor—residing as they   do at a distance of four thousand miles from the colonies—could
  they   understand of appreciate the difficulties, and the long train of evils, that
  \  must inevitably follow in the train of hasty and rash legislation, upon a   question
  at once so important and so delicate. </p> <p>   But it is not so in the United
  States. We live under a written Constitution,   conferring certain powers upon the
  general government, and specifically   withholding others; and among the powers
  thus reserved, is that of interfering   with the domestic relations of the several
  States. So that although&nbsp; the   general government is paramount in some respects,
  neither it, nor the state   governments, nor the people of the free states, have
  any more right to   interfere with the slave question, than they have to interfere
  with the   nobility and the serfs of Russia, or the manufacturers and their operatives
  in   England, or on the question of repealing the Irish Union. The truth—and every
  \  day’s experience more thoroughly convinces us of the fact—that the slave   question
  must be left with&nbsp; the state governments, and the people where   the evil exists.
  They understand the subject better than we do; they best know   how to mitigate
  its rigors; and, ultimately, to apply the means of cure.   Meantime let the efforts
  of American Christians and philanthropists be   directed in the best and most efficient,
  and yet legal and inoffensive manner,   to the moral and social improvement of the
  slave population, with a view to   their gradual and ultimate emancipation. Depend
  upon it, the true method of   improving the conditions of the slaves, and preparing
  them for that freedom   which they must one day be put in possession of, is to pursue
  a kind and   conciliatory course towards their masters. To abuse and exasperate
  them, can   have only the&nbsp; follow effect, viz: that of binding the fetters
  of the   slave more strongly—excluding information from him more rigidly—and   protracting
  the period of his servitude indefinitely. </p> <p>   With these views we deprecate
  all improper interference upon the subject. It   regard to Messrs. Stuart and Thompson,
  we would treat them with all possible   hospitality and kindness. We could not allow
  a finger to be&nbsp; raised   against them, nor a hair of their heads to be injured.—But
  they&nbsp; should   neither of them be allowed again to make any public show in&nbsp;
  any town,   city, or village, north of the State of Delaware, upon this subject.
  We desire   that it may be perfectly understood, wherever these foreign agents may
  present   themselves to agitate the slave question, that they shall not be&nbsp;
  heard.   They have no business here upon such a mission. And measures at once the
  most   peaceable and effectual, should be adopted to prevent them from scattering
  \  fire-brands, arrows and death amongst us. </p> "
