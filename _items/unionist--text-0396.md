transcription: "<p>  “Some two or three&nbsp; weeks since we published, upon authority
  so<br>  respectable as to have been considered altogether unquestionable, an account<br>
  \ of the unwelcome reception of the Rev. Captain Stuart, of Great Britain, in<br>
  \ the town of Plainfield, Conn., together with a statement as to his rather<br>
  \ forcible expulsion from that place. It appears that the account received by us<br>
  \ was not altogether correct; but wherein it was incorrect, we have not been<br>
  \ able exactly to ascertain. But for the style of rudeness with which we have<br>
  \ been assailed upon&nbsp; this subject, we should have noted the inaccuracy of<br>
  \ the account communicated to us before, although we had not the means of<br>  correcting
  it. All the papers contradicting our version of&nbsp; the affair,<br>  have admitted
  that disturbances did&nbsp; attend Captain Stuart’s visit to<br>  Plainfield, but
  have not informed us&nbsp; as to particulars. The<br>  <em>Emancipator</em>  of
  yesterday, commences an article this:—<br></p><p>  “THE AFFAIR AT PLAINFIELD.—Our
  readers probably know that during the height of<br>  the late reign of terror in
  New York, the Editor of the N.Y. Commercial<br>  Advertiser, “more the organ of
  the&nbsp; Colonization Society than any other<br>  in this city,” endeavored to
  keep himself and his mob in countenance by a<br>  ludicrous and apparently approving
  account of a mob said to have taken place<br>  in Plainfield, Conn., in which the
  farmers of that place were described as<br>  literally driving Charles Stuart out
  of town with their cart whips.<br>  <em>The story was not true.</em>  —But it was
  true that some unmannerly boys attempted, without success, to<br>  disturb the lecture.
  The following is extracted from an&nbsp; account given in<br>  the Brooklyn (Ct.)
  Unionist:<br></p><p>  “We have called them<br>  <em>gentlemen,</em>  though had
  they been strangers to us, had we not been personally acquainted<br>  with them,
  known their high pretensions, the respectability of their<br>  parentage, their
  advantages for learning what belongs to the character of a<br>  gentleman, and that
  on many occasions&nbsp; they show that they<br>  <em>do</em>  know how to conduct
  with propriety, there is much reason to&nbsp; fear that<br>  their disorderly behaviour,
  their indecency and rudeness of language and<br>  action, would have led us to rank
  them with the lowest vulgar. As it is,<br>  however, the graduate of Yale, the undergraduate
  of another college, the<br>  students in the academy, the sons of wealthy and respectable
  citizens of<br>  Plainfield, of church members and zealous colonizationists,<br>
  \ <em>    (for the parents of every Plainfield youth whom we {noted?] in the rabble,<br>
  \   are decided ‘Colonizationists’) must, we suppose, be called gentlemen, be<br>
  \   their conduct what it may.—<br>  </em>  Much good may the name do them, and
  may they yet learn to deserve it, though<br>  we fear ‘twill be a hard lesson for
  some of them, [undecipherable] any truth<br>  in the maxims of moralists respecting
  the [undecipherable]<br></p><p>  [undecipherable] than one exception, we<br>  <em>know,</em>
  \ and we think [undecipherable]{end of Unionist quote and, by implication, of<br>
  \ Emancipator quote}<br></p><p>  Now in the first place, the introductory&nbsp;
  remarks of the Emancipator are<br>  not true. Our account of the Plainfield disturbance<br>
  \ <em>was not</em>  published “during the height of the late reign of terror,” but
  when all was<br>  tranquil in the week following [my note – it was published July
  15<sup>th</sup>  – notes in main PC file];—and in the second place, the account
  of the Brooklyn<br>  Unionist, (an&nbsp; abolition paper published in the neighborhood
  of<br>  Plainfield,) represents the case, if anything, more unfavorably than we<br>
  \ did.—Indeed our mistake seems to have consisted only in stating that the young<br>
  \ men cracked their whips while Mr. Stuart was forcibly placed in his waggon<br>
  \ (sic). Upon this point, then, we stand corrected.<br></p><p>  But a communication
  under the signature of Captain Stuart himself, which<br>  appears in the Emancipator,
  with the prefatory remark that it “was refused<br>  publication in the Commercial
  Advertiser,” calls for a few observations. It<br>  was not because he attempted
  to correct an error into which it is<br>  [indecipherable] fallen, that we objected
  to the publication of his<br>  article—for that we would very cheerfully [indecipherable]
  done at any time.<br>  Our objection arose not only from the inflammatory character
  of the<br>  communication, as a while, but from a more weighty consideration still.
  We<br>  entirely object to the visit of Captain Stuart among us, as being not only<br>
  \ uncalled for, but highly improper; and it would be the highth of imprudence<br>
  \ for him, again to appear before the public, on the subject of his mission,<br>
  \ either in print, in the pulpit, or at the forum. He seems to be an amiable,<br>
  \ and we doubt not a good man; but he has no business in this country on such<br>
  \ an&nbsp; errand. How, for instance, would it be received for an American to<br>
  \ repair to England, for the purpose of delivering lectures in favor repealing<br>
  \ the Act of Union between England and Ireland! Such interference in the<br>  internal
  affairs of another nation, would not be permitted, and any<br>  <em>foreign agent</em>
  \ attempting it, would very properly be prevented from opening his lips. The<br>
  \ principle, it will be seen, is precisely the same.<br></p><p>  But Mr. Stuart,
  it appears, is not long to be the only agent from abroad,<br>  engaged in the work
  of enlightening our country on the subject of its<br>  own&nbsp; domestic and social
  relations. He is soon to be joined by a Mr.<br>  Thompson, who is understood to
  be on his way hither&nbsp; as a Missionary from<br>  some excellent ladies of Glasgow.
  Mr. Thompson is said to be an able and an<br>  eloquent man; but we trust that on
  his arrival amongst us, he will perceive<br>  the propriety of withholding any displays,
  either of his talents or his<br>  rhetoric, on the subject of his mission.—Indeed—and
  we say it deliberately,<br>  though with all kindness—we hold that neither Mr. Stuart,
  nor Mr. Thompson,<br>  nor any other strangers from abroad, should be permitted
  to convoke and<br>  harangue an American assembly upon this question. We doubt not
  the goodness of<br>  their intentions; but they are laboring under a sad mistake,
  as to the path of<br>  duty. If they have feelings of kindness for the slaves of
  this country, let<br>  them remain in their own; or else, if they choose, let them
  imitate a King and<br>  a Van Rensselaer, and go among the slaves to preach the
  Gospel in a manner<br>  compatible with the laws and usages of those States. The
  truth is, these<br>  excellent, though misjudging, philanthropists, do not understand
  the real nad<br>  inherent difficulties of the case, arising from the&nbsp; essential
  difference<br>  in the structures of our respective governments. The British Constitution
  is<br>  unwritten, consisting, in fact, of the common law of the realm. Parliament
  is<br>  omnipotent; and it had a perfect right, politically speaking, to abolish
  the<br>  slavery of its colonies at a blow, if it chose to do so.—Nor—residing as
  they<br>  do at a distance of four thousand miles from the colonies—could they<br>
  \ understand of appreciate the difficulties, and the long train of evils, that<br>
  \ must inevitably follow in the train of hasty and rash legislation, upon a<br>
  \ question at once so important and so delicate.<br></p><p>  But it is not so in
  the United States. We live under a written Constitution,<br>  conferring certain
  powers upon the general government, and specifically<br>  withholding others; and
  among the powers thus reserved, is that of interfering<br>  with the domestic relations
  of the several States. So that although&nbsp; the<br>  general government is paramount
  in some respects, neither it, nor the state<br>  governments, nor the people of
  the free states, have any more right to<br>  interfere with the slave question,
  than they have to interfere with the<br>  nobility and the serfs of Russia, or the
  manufacturers and their operatives in<br>  England, or on the question of repealing
  the Irish Union. The truth—and every<br>  day’s experience more thoroughly convinces
  us of the fact—that the slave<br>  question must be left with&nbsp; the state governments,
  and the people where<br>  the evil exists. They understand the subject better than
  we do; they best know<br>  how to mitigate its rigors; and, ultimately, to apply
  the means of cure.<br>  Meantime let the efforts of American Christians and philanthropists
  be<br>  directed in the best and most efficient, and yet legal and inoffensive manner,<br>
  \ to the moral and social improvement of the slave population, with a view to<br>
  \ their gradual and ultimate emancipation. Depend upon it, the true method of<br>
  \ improving the conditions of the slaves, and preparing them for that freedom<br>
  \ which they must one day be put in possession of, is to pursue a kind and<br>  conciliatory
  course towards their masters. To abuse and exasperate them, can<br>  have only the&nbsp;
  follow effect, viz: that of binding the fetters of the<br>  slave more strongly—excluding
  information from him more rigidly—and<br>  protracting the period of his servitude
  indefinitely.<br></p><p>  With these views we deprecate all improper interference
  upon the subject. It<br>  regard to Messrs. Stuart and Thompson, we would treat
  them with all possible<br>  hospitality and kindness. We could not allow a finger
  to be&nbsp; raised<br>  against them, nor a hair of their heads to be injured.—But
  they&nbsp; should<br>  neither of them be allowed again to make any public show
  in&nbsp; any town,<br>  city, or village, north of the State of Delaware, upon this
  subject. We desire<br>  that it may be perfectly understood, wherever these foreign
  agents may present<br>  themselves to agitate the slave question, that they shall
  not be&nbsp; heard.<br>  They have no business here upon such a mission. And measures
  at once the most<br>  peaceable and effectual, should be adopted to prevent them
  from scattering<br>  fire-brands, arrows and death amongst us.<br></p>"
