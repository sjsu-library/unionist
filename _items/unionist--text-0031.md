transcription: GRAPE SHOT—The Advertiser kindly warns us of our exposure “to a tremendous
  shower of grape shot from the Press in this state,” supposing, doubtless, that the
  great guns it has discharged with so much noise and smoke, will alarm the whole
  host of the Black Law defenders, and bring all their batteries to bear upon us.
  Be it so. While we are entrenched behind the bomb-proof breastwork of truth and
  justice, we shall care very little for the missiles of our opponents, whether the
  “grape shot” of those of greater caliber, or the lighter metal from the Advertiser’s
  blunderbuss.
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: Burleigh indicates that The Unionist doesn't fear "the whole host of the
  Black Law defenders."
