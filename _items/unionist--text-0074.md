  </em> information on the Statute, &amp;c. </p> <p>Prudence Crandall</p> <p> Miss
  Crandall was originally brought before Rufus Adams, Esq. a Justice of the Peace
  for Windham County, by a warrant issued by him on a complaint by the Grand Juror
  of the town of Canterbury, charging her with violating a statute law of the State
  of Connecticut passed at the last session of the Legislature in regard to teaching,
  boarding, harboring, &amp;c. persons of color, not inhabitants of the State. She
  entered a demurrer to the complaint, the Court judged the complaint sufficient and
  thereupon ordered Miss Crandall to give bond with surety in the sum of $150, for
  her appearance before the next County Court to be tried on said complaint, and abide
  the judgment of said Court thereon. Failing to procure bonds, she was committed
  to prison. The cause came on for trial before the County Court on Friday, August
  23d: C.F. Cleaveland, Esq. the Attorney for the State, being absent from indisposition,
  the Court appointed Jonathan A. Welch, Esq. special attorney to conduct the prosecution.
  A.T. Judson and I. Bulkley, Esqrs. were associate counsel . &nbsp; Hon. Calvin Goddard,
  Hon. W. W. Ellsworth and Henry Strong, Esq. appeared for the defence. The jury being
  empannelled and sworn, the counsel for the defence objected to one of the jurors
  from Canterbury on the ground that he had signed petitions, &amp;c. in respect to
  Miss Crandall’s school, and taken active measures to put it down. The Court sustained
  the objection, and the juror was excused. They also objected to another of the jurors
  on the ground that he was a member of the Legislature which passed the law, was
  one of those who voted for it, and had, of course, formed an opinion with respect
  to its constitutionality. The Court decided that the juror was competent to sit.
  (He got excused, however, on account of sickness.) The information against Miss
  Crandall consisted of two counts. The first charged “that the said Prudence Crandall,
  on the 24 <sup>th</sup> day of June last, with force, and arms, in a certain school
  which before that time had been and then was set up in said Canterbury, for the
  instruction and teaching of colored persons, to wit: Theodosia De Grasse, Ann Peterson,
  Amelia Elizabeth Wilder, Ann Eliza Hammond, and others whose names are unknown,
  who at the time so taught and instructed were not inhabitants of any town in this
  state, which said acts were done, by the said Prudence Crandall, without the consent,
  in writing, first had and obtained of a majority of the civil authority and select
  men of the said town of Canterbury, within which said school was then instructed,
  against the peace of this state, and contrary to the form and effect of the statute
  in such case made and provided.” </p> <p> The second count charged “that the defendant,
  with force and arms did wilfully and knowingly harbor and board, and aid and assist
  in harboring and boarding certain colored persons (named above,) who, when so harbored
  and boarded, were not inhabitants of any town in this State—without the consent
  in writing of the civil authority and select men, &amp;c.” </p> <p>Plea, Not Guilty.</p>
  <p>The following witnesses were then called on the part of the prosecution.</p>
  <p> <em>Asahel Bacon</em> said that he had called at Miss Crandall’s house in the
  month of June last, having heard that she had taken some scholars from abroad. Capt.
  Sanger accompanied him. They were both select men of the town. Miss Crandall invited
  them into her house very politely. They asked her in relation to her scholars. She
  said she had four who were from New York and one from Hartford.—She called them
  in and introduced them. Theodosia De Grass, Amelia Elizabeth Wildes, and Catherine
  Ann Weldon, he thinks were the names of those called. Witness did not remember the
  day of the month that he called—thinks it was the day after the girls came—certainly
  soon after. </p> <p> <em>Ebenezer Sanger</em> coincided in the statement of Mr.
  Bacon. </p> <p> <em>George Cady</em> had conversed with Miss Crandall—went to her
  house on Friday last to summon as witnesses to support this prosecution, some of
  the girls who were attending the school. One of those named in this subpoena said
  that she had been sent for him, on account of the sickness of her mother, and wished
  him to excuse her attendance at Court—told her that he could not, but would state
  the circumstances to the public prosecutor. Miss Crandall said that she did not
  see that there was any need of witnesses at all, for she should confess that she
  had broken the law. </p> <p> <em>Ann Peterson,</em> This witness was a colored girl,
  said to be a pupil of Miss Crandall, and was one of those named in the information
  to whom Miss C. had given instruction. Mr. Ellsworth objected to the examination
  of the witness on the ground that she could not testify without implicating herself.
  Mr. Welch read the clause of the statute under which this prosecution was sustained,
  in which it was enacted that the pupils in a school kept contrary to the act, might
  be compelled to testify. Mr. Ellsworth said that he denied, altogether, the competency
  of the Legislature to compel a witness to testify, or answer questions that might
  implicate him, even to render himself liable in debt—otherwise a witness might be
  compelled to testify to what would charge him with the crime of murder. He alluded
  to the State Constitution and Bill of Rights which he claimed protected every person
  from criminating himself by being compelled to give testimony. It was contrary to
  fundamental principles. In this case the witness might make herself an aider and
  abettor, and subject herself to the penalties imposed by the statute. Mr. Judson
  claimed that the witness would not by her testimony implicate herself. The law was
  penal, and must be construed strictly. Even if she was aware that she was instructed
  by Miss Crandall, it would not charge herself with any crime. Mr. Judson read at
  length from Starkie on evidence, to show that the witness ought, on common law principles,
  to be examined, and was bound to answer questions as to what she knew of Miss C.’s
  school. At all events he claimed that, in this instance, such must be the case as
  the Legislature had expressly enacted that the pupils should be witnesses. Mr. Ellsworth,
  in reply, said he apprehended the question to be whether the Legislature possessed
  the power to compel a witness to convict himself. He read from the opinion of Chief
  Justice Hosmer, in the 8 <sup>th</sup> Con. Rep. and also from the case of the people
  vs. Mather, in 4 <sup>th</sup> Wendell’s Reps on the subject of examining witnesses
  . &nbsp; By the principles decided these cases, which were the settled law of the
  land, he claimed that the witness was not compelled to answer any questions in relation
  to her knowledge of this school. The Court decided that the witness, under the circumstances,
  was not protected, but must be examined.—The examination was about to proceed, when
  Mr. Ellsworth rose and stated to the Court that the witness had been advised not
  to answer interrogatories in regard to her knowledge of this school. He felt it
  to be his duty now to repeat this advice. He wished the Court, however, distinctly
  to understand that the counsel for the accused had taken this course not with a
  view to embarrass the trial, but solely from a sense of duty. He conscientiously
  believed that the legal rights of the witness were such that she should not be compelled
  to testify. The Counsel for the prosecution, asked the witness when she came to
  Canterbury, but she declined answering the question. A number of other questions
  were then proposed to the witness, the principal of which were—“Has Miss Crandall
  kept a school for colored girls not inhabitants of this state?”—“Will you say whether
  the defendant has or has not instructed any person of color other than yourself
  since the 10 <sup>th</sup> of June last, or boarded and instructed colored persons
  not inhabitants of this state?” To all these and other questions of a similar character,
  the witness decline giving an answer, on the ground that she could not do so without
  criminating herself. The counsel for the prosecution then called <em>Catherine Ann
  Weldon</em> and <em>Eliza Hammond,</em> both girls of color, and charged with being
  pupils of Miss Crandall, and propounded to them the same questions as above; but
  they for the same reason, and by the advice of counsel, declined answering. The
  prosecuting Attorney reserved to himself, though he waived for the present, the
  right of moving for an order that these witnesses be committed for a contempt of
  court. </p> <p> <em>Jacob C. Gould</em> said he was acquainted with Ann Eliza Hammond.
  She belonged to Providence R.I. had known her since she was a child—was the daughter
  of Thomas Hammond, who died in 1826. Her mother now lived in Providence—the father
  at his death was worth from 1500 to $2000 in real estate. </p> <p> <em>Levi Kneeland,</em>
  Was not connected with Miss Crandall’s school except as an adviser in relation to
  it—was pastor of the Church to which Miss Crandall belonged—had seen several of
  the colored girls who were present at his church during the summer. In reply to
  a question whether he had seen one of the girls elsewhere than at his church declined
  answering. In reply to the question whether he had not seen one of them at Miss
  Crandall’s, declined answering—decline to answer whether he had advised Miss Crandall
  in relation to her school. Declined answering whether or not he had been in Miss
  Crandall’s school since the 10 <sup>th</sup> of June last. The court, having decided
  that he was bound to answer the questions put to him, and that the reasons he offered
  for refusing to do so, namely, that he might subject himself to a prosecution, and
  entangle himself in difficulties, were insufficient, granted a motion for a mittimus
  to commit him to prison and he was taken into custody by the Sheriff. </p> <p> <em>Eliza
  Parkis</em> (a woman of color) was acquainted with Ann Eliza Hammond, one of the
  girls that Miss Crandall was charged with having instructed. Has seen her in Providence—has
  also seen her at Miss Crandall’s, and slept in a room with Miss De Grasse a colored
  girl from New York. Miss Crandall employed witness to work for her, because she
  said she did not wish to keep her scholars out of school to do the work. Never saw
  any of the girls in school.—Have seen them have books and study them. </p> <p> <em>Rowland
  Greene</em> (affirmed) Has often heard that Miss Crandall kept a school for colored
  girls in Canterbury—has been at the house often, was called as a physician—went
  there and saw several colored girls—heard some of them recite in grammar, geography,
  &amp;c. Some of the girls has been at his own house. Has seen a little girl there,
  said to be from New York—has heard Miss Crandall talk concerning her scholars from
  abroad—does not recollect to have heard her say that they were from New York. </p>
  <p> <em>Mr. Kneeland</em> was not placed at the bar by the Sheriff at his request,
  and said he intended no disrespect to the Court by declining to answer the interrogatories
  put to him, and being advised that he should not implicate himself by doing so,
  he was ready to answer. He proceeded to state that he had visited Miss Crandall’s
  school twice. Once it was under the charge of another person. He had prayed in the
  school and conversed with the girls on religious subjects—does not remember faces
  as well as people in general—could not therefore positively identify any one of
  those present as being the ones seen at Miss Crandall’s—should think they were—his
  best belief on the subject would be a guess—has taken meals at Miss Crandall’s and
  eaten with her pupils—has heard them recite their lessons—thinks he has heard Miss
  Hammond spoken of either by the defendant or her sister. Miss Crandall has conversed
  with him in relation to her scholars—thinks she has told him that some of them were
  from New York, and some from Providence and New-Haven. </p> <p> <em>Albert Hinckley,</em>
  has been at Miss Crandall’s several times since the month of June last—does not
  know whether he has been in her school room as he knows not in which room it is
  kept, has not conversed with her on the subject of the residence of her scholars—called
  on her as a friend and conversed on various topics—has heard that she kept a school
  for colored persons—has heard her speak of her scholars and school—has seen colored
  ladies at her house and has taken tea with them—cannot say whether any of those
  present were the ones or not. </p> <p> <em>Eliza Glasko,</em> This witness was a
  colored girl belonging to the school but an inhabitant of this state. The same objection
  was made to examining her as was before made in respect to the others, but the objection
  was overruled by the Court. She however declined answering the questions propounded
  to her. The prosecuting attorney moved the court for a mittimus to commit the witness
  for contempt of court. The court granted the motion and ordered the clerk to make
  out a mittimus. </p> <p> <em>Hezekiah Crandall,</em> (affirmed) His sister Prudence
  keeps a school at Canterbury for colored girls—knows Ann Eliza Hammond—could not
  certainly recognize any other that was present except perhaps Ann Peterson—has never
  been in the school nor heard the pupils recite—has seen Ann Eliza Hammond at his
  sisters, often, during June and July,—supposed she boarded there and was instructed
  by his sisters with others—knows by sight and name Amelia Wildes—does not know where
  she is now—has not heard his sister say any thing on the subject of her school for
  some time—she has resided in Canterbury some portion of the time for twelve years
  past. </p> <p> <em>James Chandler</em> said he was at Miss Crandall’s several times
  last spring (not being able to say with certainty whether he had been there since
  the passage of the law he was not interrogated farther.) </p> <p> <em>George Roberts</em>
  went to Miss Crandall’s about five months ag and carried a colored girl, Miss Hammond
  to the school—Miss Hammond it was said belonged to Providence, has been at Miss
  C’s since that time perhaps within ten weeks and drank tea—he then saw Miss Hammond
  but does not know whether she boarded there constantly or not—he heard her and other
  colored girls recite in Miss Crandall’s school—should think this was two or three
  months ago—has been at Miss C’s within a week but did not as he remembers see any
  of the girls present there at that time. </p> <p> <em>Mary Benson</em> (affirmed)
  Has been at Miss Crandall’s school and found it very interesting—was never present
  but for a short time—‘tis for colored persons—saw Ann Eliza Hammond there—she is
  one of the scholars and boards with Miss C.—Witness recognized several of those
  present as among the number she had seen at Miss Crandall’s—one of the pupils, Ann
  Weldon was from New-York—Miss Hammond was from Providence—witness was at Miss Crandall’s
  five weeks since and took tea—several colored girls were at the table—does not know
  where any of them belonged except by report—visited the school when it was near
  closing and heard Miss C. give the girls instruction in Geography and Arithmetic.
  The prosecuting Attorney here rested his evidence, and the sheriff having served
  his process on Eliza Glasko was about committing her to prison, when Mr. Ellsworth
  interposed and stated to the court that rather than have the girl committed he should
  advise her to testify—again repeating that the course of the defendant’s counsel
  in relation to the testimony of these girls, was dictated by an imperious sense
  of professional duty. </p> <p> <em>Eliza Glasko</em> the proceeded to give testimony.
  She said she was a member of Miss C’s school, and that the other girls near her
  were also members—one of them from Providence, the other said to be from New-York—the
  ordinary branches were taught them by Miss C.—reading, writing, grammar, geography,
  &amp;c., witness begun to go on the first of April—the school was usually opened
  and closed with prayer—the scriptures were read and explained daily in the school—some
  portions were committed to memory by the pupils and considered a part of their education.
  </p> <p>Mr. Judson then opened the case on the part of the prosecution.</p> <p>
  He first stated the case and read the Act of the Legislature which he claimed that
  Miss Crandall had violated. He said that this act did not prevent any black from
  attending the district schools in the State, or any higher schools—that they had
  all the benefits of the school fund, and might attend the academies, high schools,
  or colleges, and that too whether they were citizens of this state, of other states,
  or of any part of the world. The sole intention and provision of the act was, that
  colored persons, from another jurisdiction, should not be intruded into any town
  in this state, without a written permission from the select men and civil authority
  of the town in which they proposed to reside. This was all, and this was perfectly
  lawful. The whole tenor and effect of the law was to place a school for colored
  persons under the care and supervision of the select men and civil authority of
  each town. He should ask the attention of the Court to the face that the Legislature
  had exercised a controlling power over schools within the limits of the state since
  1717. (Mr. Judson here read from an old edition of the statutes, in respect to the
  power which the Legislature had exercised over schools in respect to preventing
  disorders and the application of the public money.)—These said Mr. Judson, were
  schools for the instruction of all classes, and the acts which he had read, showed
  that the Legislature thought proper to exercise care over these schools. Such was
  the ancient policy of the state, and this new law was no change of policy. The state
  owed its present honors, its present glories, to pursuing this policy of keepings
  its schools under a supervising power. Nor was there anything in the Constitution
  of the United States to prevent it. Towns, he claimed, had a right to say who should
  be allowed to become inhabitants by residence in their limits and this law gave
  them no more power than was necessary for the exercise of that right. That the law
  was illiberal and reflected disgrace on the State, on the Legislature which enacted
  it, he denied. On the contrary, said Mr. J., there are now more than 1500 schools
  in the state, supported by our fund of $1,800,000, to which blacks may go without
  the payment of a cent. Small as the state was, smaller than single counties in some
  other states, these facts were true concerning it. For himself he was proud of it.
  Where could a parallel be found in the universe? </p> <p> Public policy, continued
  Mr. J., absolutely demands that a law of this description should be maintained.
  It was claimed to be unconstitutional because exclusive in its operation on a particular
  class. Other laws of the state were liable to the same objection. Physicians and
  lawyers were instances of the operation of our exclusive law. Tanners, Taverners,
  Surveyors, &amp;c. must all be licensed. Manufactories were liable to be visited
  by the select men and civil authority for the purpose of seeing that the children
  employed in them were properly educated. If persons came here from other states
  and set up manufacturing establishments they were equally liable to be visited in
  this way though no such provisions existed in the laws of the states from whence
  they come. Lawyers in this state could not purchase choses [sic] in action. All
  these laws, with many similar ones, were passed in derogation of rights originally
  common to all; public policy however, required the enactment of them, as it did
  of the one in question, and in his opinion they all stood on similar grounds, and
  were, without question, in accordance with the Constitution. </p> <p> Mr. J. next
  referred to the course which other states had pursued in legislating on the subject
  of the blacks. He remarked on the law of Ohio. Our law is not, said Mr. J., an act
  of exclusion, nor an act of prohibition. It does not pretend to send away those
  who belong here, nor does it prohibit any from coming, but only makes it necessary
  that permission be first obtained. The laws of Georgia and North Carolina went so
  far as to authorise the imprisonment of blacks who came within their limits, even
  though they came in the capacity of cooks and stewards of vessels. In Tennessee
  blacks could not come from other states and remain within the state above twelve
  days without incurring penalties. In Maryland a man could not manumit his slave
  without his leaving the state. Even in Pennsylvania, “the land of Penn,” no free
  negro could remain without giving bonds for his support. All these laws Mr. J. claimed
  to be obnoxious to equal and indeed to greater constitutional objections than the
  one in question. The article in the constitution of the United States with which
  this law was supposed to conflict, he understood to be, the 2d section of the 4
  <sup>th</sup> article:—“The citizens of each state shall be entitled to all the
  privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states.” Mr. J. claimed that
  the term “citizens” in this place, and throughout the constitution, had a technical
  signification—a legal meaning—that it did not include colored persons—that they
  were not be the constitution recognized as citizens. A certain class of colored
  persons, (slaves) were in it considered as property. </p> <p> Mr. J. here referred
  to the laws of the United State on the subject of naturalization, reading from Ingersoll’s
  Digest, the several acts of Congress, and insisted that from them all, the language
  being precise, technical, and certain, none other than white persons could be naturalized
  citizens of the United States. He also read from the 2 <sup>nd</sup> Kent’s Com.
  70, 71, 72, by which he further illustrated these views. </p> <p> There have been,
  continued Mr. J., concurrent acts of the State of Connecticut which give the same
  construction to the constitution. If “citizen” do not mean a white person only—if
  it be claimed that a black is a citizen, then is the constitution of our own State
  a nullity, for it allows “free white males” alone to be electors. The privilege
  of being a freeman, he claimed, to be a higher one that the right of being educated.
  Why should a man be educated who could not be a freeman? A person who pays a single
  cent State tax, or who does military duty, is entitled to the privilege of voting.
  In Massachusetts these qualifications were not sufficient. Each state in the Union
  has these local laws and customs peculiar to itself—these must all be abrogated
  at a blow, by deciding the law in question to be unconstitutional. Full effect however,
  might be given to the clause in the constitution, referred to without producing
  this result, and that was, by construing the term “citizen” in the manner he had
  before pointed out. </p> <p> The first act in our own statute would be nullified
  by a decision that this law was unconstitutional—a citizen of another State cannot
  maintain an action in our courts for any cause unless a substantial inhabitant of
  the State give bond for him. No one has doubted the constitutionality of this law,
  and the law in question, with respect to constitutionality, could not be distinguished
  from it. </p> <p> Mr. J. said he should conclude his remarks on this subject by
  alluding merely to one other argument in support of this law, and that was, that
  the public safety of this State, the preservation of its true interests, required
  this law to be enforced. The southern States might emancipate their slaves and send
  them all to Connecticut instead of Liberia. The influx of that species of population
  might be so great as to be overwhelming. (Mr. J. proceeded to remark on the effect
  which recent measures of the British Parliament, on the subject of slavery, might
  have on this question, when he was interrupted by the court, who remarked that tho’
  far from inclined to restrain all the limits of the discussion, yet it did not seem
  pertinent to the issue to argue the policy or expediency of the laws. Mr. J. said
  he would not press the point.) Mr. J. hoped that he had not been misunderstood in
  the remarks he had made. He wished not to oppress any class of population. He heartily
  wished that every slave might be emancipated that every day. But if it could not
  be done without destruction to our constitutions, and desolating our land, he could
  not desire it. </p> <p> He would only add to the Jury that though it was true they
  were at liberty to consider what the court said to them on the subject of the law,
  as advice, still he hoped they would pay it such respect as advice from the bench
  was properly entitled to. A single word as to the facts. The information charged
  the defendant with boarding and instructing, in different counts. It was sufficient
  if they found her guilty on either. The day was immaterial. If they found her guilty
  of doing the act charged on any day, since the passage of the law, and before the
  filing of the information, ‘twas sufficient. It was not necessary that they should
  find that she had boarded or instructed each of the persons named in the information;
  to instruct or board one was a transgression of the law. </p> <p>As to the proof
  it was abundant, conclusive.</p> <p> Mr. Ellsworth, after stating the case, and
  remarking on the prohibitions of the law, said that he proposed not to occupy time
  in relation to the facts of the case. He would willingly have advised the pupils
  of Miss Crandall to have testified had he not believed that in so doing they voluntarily
  surrendered their most sacred rights. True it was, the defendant has kept this school—‘twas
  no secret, and whether that constituted a crime or not was for the jury to determine.
  In order to convict my client, said Mr. E., you gentlemen, must find on your oaths
  that she had committed a crime. You may find that she has violated an act of the
  State Legislature, but if you also find her protected by a higher power, it will
  be your duty to acquit. The court he was fully assured, would charge the jury that
  the law was unconstitutional, if they so believed, but after all, it belonged to
  the people to determine whether one of them had been guilty of a crime. Each one
  of the jury must be satisfied for himself alone, that a crime has been committed.
  He flattered himself that he should be able to lead them to the conclusion that
  the law in question was a violation of the constitution of this State and of the
  United States. The constitution of the United States was the highest power known
  in our land. Beyond that, no Legislature can go and if the jury find the law not
  to stand well with the constitution they must say so. </p> <p> The real question
  for the jury to settle Mr. Ellsworth apprehended to be this: Can the Legislature
  of Connecticut pass a law prohibiting the citizens of other States from coming into
  this State, and there residing, to prosecute the acquisition of knowledge, in a
  way open to the citizens of this State. This he believed was the precise question,
  and it reached deep and wide—wider and deeper than was perhaps imagined. It was
  however claimed by his friend from Canterbury, that colored persons were not citizens,
  and that the provisions of the constitution, with respect to citizens of the United
  States, did not apply to this class of our population. The criterion of citizenship
  was complexion in the view of the gentleman who had preceded him. I, said Mr. E.,
  make the criterion to be either birth or naturalization. Admitting that none but
  white persons can be naturalized, it does not touch the question of citizenship
  by birth. Is it so that a person born on our soil, is not a citizen of our soil?
  In the days of Revolution, said Mr. E., these men fought side by side with our fathers,
  and shed their blood for their country—the country to which they owed indefeasible
  allegiance. Their names were now inscribed on the Pension Rolls of the Government—they
  now received the honorable trophies of the services they had rendered. Where, said
  Mr. E., does the gentleman get the doctrine that the rights of man, as a citizen,
  depend upon his color? A colored man could appeal to the laws for the protection
  of his rights in every State could he, if he were not a citizen? (Mr. E. here read
  a few sentences from the commencement of the declaration of independence, which,
  he said, according to the argument of the gentleman opposed to him, ought to be
  changed so as to have the words “except black people” introduced between each clause,)
  Mr. E. said he was a republican, he claimed to be as much a republican as his friend
  from Canterbury, and he hoped that his friend was not so ashamed of his republicanism,
  as to wish this instrument, the Declaration of Independence, interpolated in this
  manner. Our own constitution, continued Mr. E., recognized, in express terms, equality
  of rights—that men were equal in rights, but to this the gentleman would add “except
  black men.” He hoped he should not live long enough to see such doctrine go forth
  from Connecticut. The free colored population has, and is justly entitled, to equal
  representation in the Congress of the United States with the white population. Could
  not a black man commit treason? The gentleman would have it that he could not, for
  none other than citizens can. (Mr. E. here read from the 2 <sup>nd</sup> Kent’s
  Com on the subject of citizenship, by birth.) I scout the idea, said Mr. E., that
  a man, born here by the side of me, is not a citizen because, his father was black,
  while I am a citizen because mine was white. </p> <p> [The remainder of Mr. Ellsworth’s
  argument next week together with those of Messrs. Strong and Welch.] </p> "
