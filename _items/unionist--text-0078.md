transcription: "<em>Wonderful memory of Blind Alick.</em>—There is still living at
  Stirling, a blind old beggar known to all the country<br>round by the name of blind
  Alick, who possesses a memory of almost incredible<br>strength. It was observed
  with astonishment, that, when he was a man, and<br>obliged, by the death of his
  parents, to gain a livelihood by begging through<br>the streets of his native town
  of Stirling, he knew the whole of the Bible, both<br>Old and New Testaments, by
  heart! From which you may repeat any passage, and he<br>will tell you the chapter
  and verse; or you may tell him the chapter and verse,<br>and he will repeat to you
  the passage, word for word. Not long since, a<br>gentleman, to puzzle him, read,
  with a slight verbal alteration, a verse of the<br>Bible. Alick hesitated a moment,
  and then told where it was to be found but said<br>it had not been correctly delivered;
  he then gave it as it stood in the book,<br>correcting the slight error that had
  been purposely introduced. The gentleman<br>then asked him for the 90<br><sup>th</sup>verse
  of the 7<br><sup>th</sup>chapter of Numbers. Alick was again puzzled for a moment,
  but then said hastily,<br>“You are fooling me, sir? there is no such verse—that
  chapter has only 89<br>verses.” Several other experiments of the sort were tried
  upon him with the same<br>success. He has often been questioned the day after any
  particular sermon or<br>speech, and his examiners have invariably found, that, had
  their patience<br>allowed, blind Alick would have given them the sermon or speech
  over again."
scholarlyNotes: Romanticism, but ultimately solid American piety winning, is interesting.
commentary: Blind Alick (1766-1839) was a real person, who was contradictorily used
  both as an example of piety and impiety for his remarkable knowledge of the scriptures.
  He is now featured in a Ghost Walk in Stirling.
