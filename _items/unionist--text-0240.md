transcription: "<p> “We are in the midst of a revolution,” was the startling, and
  true as startling, declaration, with which Mr. Clay commenced his speech in the
  Senate some weeks ago. We are in the midst of a political revolution, which is silently
  but fatally sapping the principles of our free institutions, and consolidating the
  whole action of the Government, into the will of the executive. “The President is
  far above the reach of anything said in this House,” said Mr Polk; and a passive
  House of Representatives—the people’s own House—hear without resenting the insolent
  assertion, and by their silence admit its truth. Yet the minister or favorite, who,
  on the floor of the English House of Commons, or of the French Chamber of Deputies,
  should hazard such a vaunt of the crowned monarchs of either of those realms, would
  be put to silence and to shame, by the indignant voices of men of <em>all</em> parties.
  He would, in those <em>limited monarchies</em> be told that the king, like the humblest
  man in the kingdom, was the subject of the laws and the creature of opinion; and
  that it belonged not to him, or to any one for him, to claim exemption from that
  dependence upon the people’s representatives, ordained for the common good o all.
  In this <em>freest of republics,</em> infallibility in judgement and in action;
  the right of constructing according to his own will all laws, and of dismissing
  at his own will all functionaries who see not with his eyes; and finally entire
  independence of the opinion of the Legislatures; are openly claimed for the Executive;
  and all who demur in the least to this sweeping claim, or who suggest that, even
  with the best motives, and the greatest caution, there may be error or mistake in
  some given act, are denounced as enemies to the “venerable President,” and forthwith
  trampled under foot as rebels and traitors—not to the country, or to freedom—but
  to <em>the</em> party. We are then in the midst of a revolution, which is habituating
  us fast and fatally to disregard all those checks and balances which the wise contrivers
  of the Constitution, thought sufficient and availing, to secure the independence
  of each department in its proper sphere; and to look to the Executive head alone,
  as the fountain of all honor, profit and power. Nor is it to politics alone that
  the revolution is confined. In a country like this, where every citizen does, or
  may if he pleases, take a part in its public affairs, no great revolution in politics
  can be effected without a corresponding revolution in morals. Accordingly we find
  that the spirit of party, which now directs all its discipline and energy to sustain
  allegiance and devotion to the person of the President—be his measures what they
  may—infects the judgement or corrupts the principles of men on other subjects, and
  the recklessness with which conscience is outraged, in approving political measures,
  which in fact it disapproved—may come at last to pervert entirely the warning voice
  of that secret monitor. </p> <p> It would seem the very “error of the moon” that
  men and doctrines such as these we have this alluded to, should find a place and
  a bearing in the Legislative halls of a people so practical, and which flatters
  itself with being so enlightened, as ours—were it not that a sufficient earthly
  explanation is at hand in the cause we referred to in the outset of these remarks—the
  spirit of party—which, so that implicit and uncompromising obedience be rendered
  to its mandates, is little solicitous about any other qualifications, in the instruments
  it puts forth. Truly indeed did Mr Binney conclude, that the question now in issue
  in this country is, whether this “spirit of party” be not more fatal to free institutions
  here, than the spirit of despotism has proved elsewhere. Its inevitable tendency,
  at any rate, is to degrade, even though it may not wholly destroy;—and in that stage
  of the question, most certainly, this State now is.— <em>N.Y. American.</em> </p>

commentary: 'The quote from Henry Clay that begins this excerpt is a famous one, from
  his speech of December 26, 1833 introducing a motion to censure President Andrew
  Jackson. The entire speech was published in early 1834: <em>Speech of the Hon. Henry
  Clay, on the Subject of the Removal of the Deposites: Delivered in the Senate of
  the United States, December 26, 30, 1833</em> (Washington DC: Duff Green, 1834).
