transcription: 'We finish this week, the Report of Mr. Olney’s Trial, as furnished
  us by MR. FOSTER, a young gentleman of acknowledged skill and fidelity as a reporter;
  and in this presenting to the public an impartial statement of the testimony in
  the case, we cannot but repeat our expression of astonishment that a man should
  have been arrested and bound over for trial, against whom there was not a shadow
  of proof—not even enough to have fixed suspicion upon a man of generally suspicious
  character, much less upon Olney, whose character stands as fair, as that of any
  person concerned in his arrest, examination, or trial. A man who can come out from
  such a trial, not only with a triumphant acquittal, but with a character so perfectly
  fair and unimpeached, notwithstanding all the pains which had been taken beforehand
  to hunt up something against him—the inquiries among his fellow-townsmen, where
  a man’s errors are likely to be known if he has committed any serious ones—has certainly
  abundant reason to complain of the injustice of being subject to so much trouble
  and expense on so slight grounds—rather so utterly without any grounds, as Mr. Olney
  has been. We do not much wonder that the Advertiser, the organ of those concerned
  in the arrest and prosecution of Olney, should contain a Report of the evidence,
  (probably from the pen of Judson himself, or some of his partizans,) so discolored
  in various parts, as to have quite a different impression on the mind of readers
  who heard none of the testimony, from that which the testimony itself would have
  left if they had heard it. We do not much wonder, for instance, that the Advertiser’s
  report should entirely leave out that part of Maria Robinson’s testimony in which
  she says that Mr. Olney had not been alone in the room more than a minute before
  the fire was discovered, thus showing it to have been absolutely impossible that
  he could have fired the house. We mention this as one example of the accuracy of
  that report, but any one who will compare it carefully with Mr. Foster’s, will find
  many other features of dissimilarity calculated to weaken the strongly unfavorable
  impressions which an accurate report would have produced, towards those at whose
  instance Olney was arrested. '

commentary: <p>In this further commentary on the acquittal of Frederick Olney, we
  learn that the <em>Windham Advertiser</em> had been publishing misleading partial
  reports on the trial, and had left out Mariah Robinson's key testimony - another
  erasure of a Black woman.</p><p>It seems likely that "Mr. Foster" is La Fayette
