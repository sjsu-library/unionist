transcription: "<p>THE UNIONIST</p><p>BROOKLYN, DECEMBER 19, 1833.</p><p>  <em>Is
  it safe to obey God?—</em>  Startle not at the query, reader, but answer it candidly.
  Has God commanded us<br>  to do any thing which would be unsafe are [sic-obvious
  printing error]<br>  inexpedient for us to do? If he has, then, painful as it might
  seem, it is our<br>  duty to obey, for surely God will not require an unnecessary
  sacrifice of any<br>  one. But we believe that it is not only always<br>  <em>safe</em>
  \ to obey the commands of God, but that our safety consists in such obedience<br>
  \ alone. We believe that He commands us to do nothing except what is for our<br>
  \ best good, and that we are not safe for a moment while we refuse to obey.<br>
  \ Should we not therefore obey<br>  <em>all</em>  the commands of God—<br>  <em>now‑immediately?</em>
  \ We should—the candid and christian reader will echo the reply,<br>  <em>“we should!”</em>
  \ Well—so much for the sermon, now for the application.<br></p><p>  God has commanded—<br>
  \ <em>“Undo the heavy burdens and let the oppressed go free.”</em>  Not yet, says
  the colonizationist—the oppressed, though they are happy and<br>  contended in their
  bondage, would so highly resent the gift of liberty and the<br>  proffer of kindness
  and sympathy that they would cut our throats for the gift<br>  and burn our dwellings
  for the proffer. It would not be safe to obey the<br>  command of God NOW—wait,
  and let us leave off sinning by degrees and make a<br>  compromise with God that
  will leave us in our sins a few years longer. Such<br>  is, in effect, the reasoning
  of the apologist for slavery. When will the time<br>  come in which men will think
  it sage and expedient to obey the Supreme Ruler<br>  of the Universe?<br></p>"
