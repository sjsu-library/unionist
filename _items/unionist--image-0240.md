caption: Signature of Charles Denison (1809-1881), in a letter to William Lloyd Garrison.
  Denison was helping to establish Anti-Slavery Societies in Hartford and Middletown.
  He was especially pleased with the latter; it seems likely that the African-American
  AMEZ minister (and Crandall endorser) Jehiel Beman and his son Amos Beman were among
  the participants.
