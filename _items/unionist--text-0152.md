transcription: "<p> MRS. CHILD’ S ‘APPEAL.' Seldom has any work more richly repaid
  us for the time spent in its perusal than Mrs. Child’s ‘Appeal,’ of which an advertisement
  will be found in another column.—Written in a style, easy, simple and elegant; enlivened
  with occasional flashes of wit, rich in important facts, happy illustrations and
  forcible, conclusive reasoning—its satire delicate but keen; its appeals touching
  and powerful; its reproofs grave, just and severe, yet couched in language courteous
  and dignified—it is altogether one of the most valuable publications which have
  for a long time fallen under our eye. We were particularly struck with the appearance
  of extensive research which characterizes the work. The gifted authoress lays under
  contribution; law, history and political science, the productions of human genius,
  and the records of divine inspiration, and with admirable skill and taste combines
  the materials drawn from these several sources, into one finished piece of neat
  &amp; polished workmanship. As a powerful auxiliary to the Anti-Slavery cause, we
  feel unable to express our high opinion of its value, and we would only express
  our ardent wish that a copy might be placed in the hands of every friend and every
  enemy of our cause, for the former an armory well stored with weapons of approved
  temper to arm him for combat in the righteous cause, to the latter the means of
  overcoming his opposition, and bringing him to enlist under the banner of justice,
  and defend the rights of the oppressed. </p> <p> To us it appears impossible for
  any candid mind and unprejudiced person to read this book with the attention it
  merits both for the importance of the subject and for the manner in which it is
  treated, without becoming a decided Abolitionist. We can confidently recommend the
  work to all who feel interested either way on the subject of slavery, Colonization,
  and Abolition, to all who would wish for a great amount of information&nbsp; on
  these interesting topics, compressed into a small space, and to all who would see
  an important subject handled withfairness , ingenuity and ability, and we need not
  add—so well is Mrs. Child known in the reading community—to all lovers of fine writing.—
  <em>Unionist</em> </p> "
scholarlyNotes: guessing at date in Unionist
commentary: Just as Garrison had shown in publishing works by Black writers male and
  female, Charles C. Burleigh here shows himself to be pro-feminist in praising a
  woman's writing without diminishing it in any way.
