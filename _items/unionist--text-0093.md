  <p align="right">FOR THE UNIONIST.</p>
  <p>
    Mr. Editor. It is truly astonishing to witness the efforts at
    misrepresentation in the last Advertiser respecting Miss Crandall’s trial.—It
    is the part of wisdom in the many correspondents to that paper that they have
    not signed their names to the articles communicated. An article appears headed
    thus, “Effects of abolition principles in a Court of Justice.” The writer
    attempts, in his way, to question the veracity of persons who were called upon
    to testify, when they said that they had drank tea with Miss Crandall and her
    scholars but could not recollect the countenances of any who were then in
    court. From this circumstance the writer wishes to convey the idea to his
    readers that they were guilty of swearing falsely, and thus were it in his
    power, would he fix upon them the seal of infamy. The writer of that article
    should know, that however much honorable men may differ from him in sentiment,
    merely a difference of opinion does not render them incapable of speaking the
    truth, and whenever he touches upon an honorable man’s character, he touches a
    very tender spot. However lightly he may regard it,—character, in the
    estimation of some men—some abolitionists we trust—ay, even some who have had
    the hardihood to
    <em>sit at the same table</em>
    with Miss Crandall and her colored misses—is above all price. The writer
    thinks it is a most incredible circumstance that a person could drink tea with
    20 misses whom he never saw before, and 2 or 3 months afterwards, when he
    should see misses in a public assembly, could not recollect that they were the
    persons with whom he drank tea. Perhaps they were present at the table, and
    perhaps they were not. But suppose they were—would it be any thing strange for
    a
    <em>gentleman</em>
    to sit down at table with 20 misses, half of them perhaps, sitting in a direct
    line with himself, (so that it would be extremely difficult for him to see
    them) and not seeing their countenances so as immediately to recollect them
    when seen a number of weeks afterwards, with their bonnets on—in a different
    attire—in a “court of Justice?” Surely these gentlemen—as they said they could
    not recollect them—must be set down as liars, for no one can doubt—considering
    the circumstances—that there was a
    <em>reasonable possibility</em>
    of their not knowing them at a glance—whether they were there or not. We would
    advise the writer of that article to look up much reckless villains and have
    them tried for perjury.

scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: It is worth noting the sarcastic emphasis this letter-writer gives to
  the notion of sharing the table with the Black students at the Canterbury Female
  Academy. This suggests that there were members of the white community who were "unlearning"
  their racism - and recognizing the racist presumptions in others.
