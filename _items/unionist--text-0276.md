  York</p> <p> The subscriber informs those who feel alive to the great evils of Slavery
  in this favored country that he has opened a store for the disposal <em>exclusively</em>
  of the above articles—and has at present for sale, Domestic and East India manufactures—Rice,
  Coffee, Sugar, Molasses, and Lemon Syrups &amp;c. </p> <p> Having procured many
  of the foregoing with great care and much exertion he is determined to dispose of
  them at a very moderate profit, for ready money only. </p> <p>JOSEPH H. BEALE</p>

scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: The "great care and much exertion" required to obtain Free Produce goods
  demonstrates how intertwined slavery was with every dimension of American and international
  commerce at the time.
