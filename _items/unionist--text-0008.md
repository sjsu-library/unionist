transcription: "<em>“The Unionist”</em> is the title of a paper just established at
  Brooklyn, Conn. It zealously espouses the cause of the persecuted Miss Crandall,
  advocates the immediate abolition of slavery, and justly denounces the foolish and
  wicked law of Connecticut, which imposes a penalty for teaching colored persons
  to read. It seems, the necessity for the establishment of this paper arose from
  the fact, that the friends of constitutional liberty were excluded from the columns
  of the other. It handles the projectors and advocates of the <em>“black </em>law”
  with merited severity; and we ardently hope that since the editor has raised the
  standard of freedom, he will keep it unfurled, so long as a single advocate of slavery
  in any form shall dare to raises his hateful head in our country."
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: The Haverhill Gazette was, at times, under the editorial guidance of John
  Greenleaf Whittier, which may explain this strong support.
