  AUGUST 8, 1833.</p><p>The Advertiser has taken us to task quite severely, for what,
  with his moral accuracy, he calls our “false pretences” or “gross inconsistency.”
  The irresistible reasoning, by which he arrives at a conclusion so unfavorable to
  us, deserves a passing notice. After quoting from our prospectus, a sentence showing
  our disapprobation of the dominant party in our last Legislature, he goes on with
  the confident air of a man who thinks he cannot be mistaken, “what is this but an
  acknowledged preference for, and a devotion to a political party?” How conclusive!
  Because we disapprove one political party, we must necessarily—not merely approve,
  but be <em>devoted</em> to another. Because we have expressed a hope that one party
  will not reign long, “it follows” that we shall endeavor to transfer the rule to
  another. Admirable logic!</p><p>To the Advertiser’s assertion that the paper originated
  in party feeling and from unworthy motives, we answer, (first asking by the way,
  who probably knows our motives best, we or the Advertiser,) that it matters little
  to what motives the establishment of the Unionist is attributable, so long as its
  <em>course</em> is fair, upright and consistent with its professions. If the Advertiser
  will pursue such a course, we will promise to say nothing about the motives which
  induced its change from the “bitter hostility to President Jackson and his friends”
  which it manifested “for nearly five years,” to a course and character diametrically
  opposite. We will not even hint that the <em>disinterested</em> Advertiser which
  resolves to “continue firm and unflinching in the pursuance of its duty, so long
  as it has one reader left,” was <em>bought up</em> by the Jackson party.</p><p>But
  it is said that we are not consistent with our professions. We will not take it
  upon us to say whether, in making this charge, the Advertiser man has exposed his
  incapacity to comprehend the plain import of language, or has shown a disposition,
  wilfully to pervert the truth. One of the two is evident. That we do not possess
  experience “in getting up independent papers,” headed with professions at variance
  with our intended practice, or in any other species of deception, which would enable
  us to impose upon the public and yet escape suspicion, we freely confess; nor is
  it our desire at present to avail ourselves of the superior experience in such matters
  of any of our editorial brethren. When we engage in an enterprise which requires
  that kind of experience, we shall doubtless call in the assistance of such of our
  acquaintance as are best versed in the mystery of making promises to be “revoked.”
  But that we are incompetent to the easy task of telling the truth, (for we consider
  it easy, whatever the Advertiser may think of it,) in plain, intelligible language,
  we are unwilling yet to admit. We refer any candid man, to our prospectus, and the
  leading article of our first number, for evidence that we have spoken intelligibly;
  and to the whole of that sheet, and of this also, for proof that, so far as we can
  be judged by our acts, what we said was <em>truth</em> that we have been consistent
  with our professions. We ask our readers to compare with the evidence thus collected,
  the leading article and several other pieces in the last Advertiser, and say if
  that paper has not misrepresented us. We have never represented ourselves as indifferent
  or neutral on the questions moral or political, at present agitating the community,
  nor are we so. We have opinions which we shall defend to the extent of our poor
  ability, for their defence this paper was established. In our leading article last
  week, we alluded to the fact that “the majority had no organ of communication,”
  as one reason why some gentlemen opposed in sentiment to the Advertiser, had put
  in operation this press, one object of which would be, to counteract the effect
  of the Advertiser’s unfair course. Now does not this show clearly, that in charging
  us as guilty of inconsistency because we oppose the measures he advocates, the Advertiser
  editor brings against us a groundless accusation.</p><p>But it will perhaps be said,
  we are pledged to no party. And so we are. Can the Advertiser see no difference
  between opposing his party and supporting another? Cannot this paper be made the
  organ of the majority, and yet be the exclusive organ of no party? If he will lay
  his finger on the passage in our paper in which we advocate any party as such, or
  in any way depart from our expressed design of canvassing the claims of men and
  the propriety of measures on their own merits, then will we acknowledge our offence,
  and humbly ask forgiveness and promise amendment, nor will we “revoke our promise”
  before the week’s end, even should he tell his readers we have made it.</p><p>While
  we thus openly declare that we are not indifferent on the subjects which have been
  noticed in our paper, we still adhere to our avowal, that we shall discuss them
  and give our opinions upon them, without reference to the circumstances that this
  or that party holds sentiments similar to, or differing from ours, we shall also
  admit properly written communications against, as well as in favor of our views.
  If this will not constitute our paper as independent one, we acknowledge our ignorance
  of the meaning of the term.</p><p>When the Advertiser detects us departing from
  this course, he may then complain of us, as we have done of him, for being one sided,
  and may call ours a “counterfeit independent paper.” And when we perceive him pursuing
  a course like this, we will acknowledge his right to the praise of <em>genuine</em>
  independence. But till then we shall consider ourselves justified in adhering to
  our original assertion, that the <em>want of fairness and independence </em>in the
  Advertiser, led to the establishment at this time, of another paper.</p>
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: There would be much in the way of partisan posturing between Charles C.
  Burleigh and the editors of the local newspapers that opposed the Canterbury Female
  Academy. He is forthright here, and reinforces that The Unionist is not "indifferent
  or neutral on the questions moral or political, at present agitating the community"
