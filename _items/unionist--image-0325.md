title: Illustration of imperfection from Holbrook's most celebrated publication, <em>Ten
  Years Among the Mailbags</em>. He had not lost his social intolerance, though; on
  the first page of the Introduction, he says that if every letter in the mailbag
  "possessed the power of uttering audibly the ideas which it contains, a confusion
  of tongues would ensue, worthy of the last stages of the tower of Babel, or of a
  Woman's Rights convention."
