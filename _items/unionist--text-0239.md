  <p align="center">From Dymond’s Essays on Political Rights and Obligations</p> <p
  align="center">II.</p> <p align="center"> “POLITICAL POWER IS RIGHTLY EXERCISED
  ONLY WHEN IT SUBSERVES THE WELFARE OF COMMUNITY” </p> <p> This proposition is consequent
  of the truth of the last. The community which has the right to withhold power, delegates
  it, of course, for its own advantage. If in any case its advantage is not consulted,
  then the object for which it was delegated is frustrated—or in simple words, the
  measure which does not promote the public welfare is not right. It matters nothing
  whether the community have delegated specifically so much power for such and such
  purposes: the power, <em>being possessed,</em> entails the obligation. Whether a
  sovereign derives absolute authority for a year, the principles of their duty are
  the same. The obligation to employ it only for the public good, is just as real
  and just as great in one case as in the other. The Russian and the Turk have the
  same right to require that the power of their rulers shall be so employed, as the
  Englishman or American. They may not be able to assert this right, but that does
  not affect its existence nor the ruler’s duty,—nor his responsibility to that <em>Almighty</em>
  Being before whom he must give an account of his stewardship. These reasonings,
  if they needed confirmation, derive it from the fact that the Deity imperatively
  requires us, according to our opportunities, to <em>do good</em> to man. </p> <p>
  But, how ready soever men are to admit the truth of this proposition as a proposition,
  it is very commonly disregarded in practice; and a vast variety of motives and objects
  direct the conduct of governments which have no connection with the public weal.
  Some <em>pretensions</em> of consulting the public weal are, indeed, usual. It is
  not to be supposed that when public officers are pursuing their own schemes and
  interests, they will <em>tell</em> the people that they disregarded theirs. When
  we look over the history of a christian nation, it is found that a large proportion
  of these measures which are most prominent in it, had little tendency to subserve,
  and did not subserve the public good. In practice it is very often forgotten for
  what purpose governments are instituted. If a man were to look over twenty treaties,
  he would probably find that half of them had very little to do with the welfare
  of the respective communities. He might find a great deal about Charles’ rights,
  and Frederick’s honor, and Louis’ possessions, and Francis’ interests,—as if the
  proper subjects of international arrangements were those which respected rulers
  rather than communities. If a man looks over the state papers which inform him of
  the origin of a war, he will probably fund that they agitate questions about Most
  Christian and Most Catholic Kings, and High Mightinesses, and Imperial Majesties,—questions,
  however, in which Frenchmen, and Spaniards, and Dutch, and Austrians, are very little
  interested or concerned, or at any rate much less interested than they are in avoiding
  the quarrel. </p> <p> Governments commonly trouble themselves unnecessarily and
  too much with the politics of other nations. A prince should turn his back towards
  other countries and his face towards his own,—just as the proper place of a landholder
  is upon his own estates and not upon his neighbor’s. If governments were wise, it
  would ere long be found, that a great portion of the endless and wearisome succession
  of treaties, and remonstrances, and embassies, and alliances, and memorials, and
  subsidies, might be dispensed with, with so little inconvenience, and so much benefit,
  that the world would wonder to think to what futile ends they had been busying and
  how needlessly they had been injuring themselves. </p> <p> No doubt, the immoral
  and irrational system of international politics which <em>generally</em> obtains,
  makes the path of one government more difficult than it would otherwise be; and
  yet it is probable that the most efficacious way of inducing another government
  to attend to its proper business, would be to attend to our own. It is not sufficiently
  considered, nor indeed is it sufficiently <em>known</em>, how powerful is the influence
  of uprightness and candor in conciliating the good officers of other men. Overreaching
  and chicanery in one person, induce overreaching and chicanery in another. Men distrust
  those whom they perceive to be unworthy of confidence. Real integrity is not without
  its being vouched in the hearts of others; and they who maintain it are treated
  with confidence, because it is seen that confidence can be safely reposed. Besides,
  he who busies himself with the politics of foreign countries, like the busy bodies
  in a petty community does not fail to offend. In the last century, our own country
  was so much of a busy body, and had involved itself in such a multitude of treaties
  and alliances, that it was found, I believe, quite impossible to fulfil one without,
  by that very act, violating another. This, of course, would offend. In private life
  that man passes through the world with the least annoyance and the greatest satisfaction,
  who confines his attention to its proper business, that is, generally, to his own:
  and who can tell why the experience of nations should in this case by different
  from that of private men? In a rectified state of international affairs, half a
  dozen princes on a continent would have little more occasion to meddle with one
  another than half a dozen neighbors in a street. </p> <p> But indeed, <em>Communities</em>
  frequently contribute to their own injury. If governors are ambitious, or resentful,
  or proud, so, often, are the people;—and the public good has often been sacrificed
  by the public, with astonishing preposterousness, to jealousy or vexation. Some
  merchants are angry at the loss of a branch of trade; they urge the government to
  interfere; memorials and remonstrances follow to the state of whom they complain;—and
  so, by that process of exasperation which is quite natural when people think that
  high language and a high attitude is politic, the nations soon begin to fight. The
  merchants applaud the spirit of their rulers,—while in one year they lose more by
  war than they would have lost by the want of the trade for twenty; and before peace
  returns, the nation has lost more than it would have lost by the continuance of
  the evil for twenty centuries. Peace at length arrives, and the government begins
  to devise means of repairing the mischiefs of the war. Both government and people
  reflect very complacently on the wisdom of their measures,—forgetting that their
  conduct is only that of a man who wantonly fractures his own leg with a club, and
  then boasts to his neighbors how dexterously he limps to a surgeon. </p> <p> Present
  expedients for present occasions, rather than a wide embracing and far-seeing policy,
  is the great characteristic of European politics. We are hucksters who cannot resist
  the temptation of a present sixpence, rather than merchants who wait for their profits
  for the return of a fleet. Si quaeris monumentum, circumspice. [If you are looking
  for a monument, look around.] Look at the condition of either of the continental
  nations, and consider what it might have been if even a short line of princes had
  attended to their proper business,—had directed their solicitude to the improvement
  of the moral and social and political condition of the people. Who has been more
  successful in this huckster policy than France? And what is France, and what are
  the French people at the present hour?—Why, as it respects real welfare they are
  not merely surpassed, they are left at an immeasurable distance, by a people who
  sprung up but as yesterday,—by a people whose land, within the memory of our grand-fathers,
  was almost a wilderness, long since France boasted of her greatness. Such results
  have a cause. It is not possible that systems of policy can be good, of which the
  effects are so bad. I speak not of particular measures or of individual acts of
  ill policy,—these are not likely to be the result of the condition of man,—but of
  the whole international system,—a system of irritability, and haughtiness, and temporary
  expedients; a system of most unphilosophical principles, and from which christianity
  is practically almost excluded. Here is the evidence of fact before us. We know
  what a sickening detail the history of Europe is. And it is obvious to remark, that
  the system which has given rise to such a history must be vicious and mistaken in
  its fundamental principles. The same class of history will continue to after generations
  unless these principles are changed,—unless philosophy and christianity obtain a
  greater influence in the practice of government; unless, in a word, governments
  are content to do their proper business, and to leave that which is not their business,
  undone. </p> <p> When such principles are acted upon we may reasonably expect a
  rapid advancement in the whole condition of the world. Domestic measures which are
  now postponed to the more stirring occupations of legislators, will be found to
  be of incomparably greater importance than they. A wise code of criminal law will
  be found to be of more consequence and interest than the acquisition of a million
  square miles of territory;—A judicious encouragement of general education will be
  of more value than all the “glory” that has been acquired from the days of Alfred
  till now. Of moral legislation, however it will be our after business to speak;
  Meanwhile the lover of mankind has some reason for gratulation in perceiving indications
  that governments will hereafter direct their attention more to the objects for which
  they are invested with power. The statesmen who promotes this improvement will be
  what many statesmen have been <em>called</em> —a great man. That government only
  is great which promotes the prosperity of its own people; and that people only are
  prosperous, who are wise and happy. </p> '

commentary: 'The presence of this excerpt implies that the <em>Unionist</em> had likely
  published the previous essay, too, in Dymond''s work. This section forms part of
  the articulation of the Peace Testimony, which is Dymond''s most signficant contribution
  to Quaker thought. For more on the influence of Dymond''s thought on American Abolition
  and the Canterbury Female Academy in particular, see Jennifer Rycenga, “The Sun
  in its Glory: The Diffusion of Jonathan Dymond’s Works in the United States, 1831-1836.”
