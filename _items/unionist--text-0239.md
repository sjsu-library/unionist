  align="center">  “POLITICAL POWER IS RIGHTLY EXERCISED ONLY WHEN IT SUBSERVES THE
  WELFARE OF<br>  COMMUNITY”<br></p><p>  This proposition is consequent of the truth
  of the last. The community which<br>  has the right to withhold power, delegates
  it, of course, for its own<br>  advantage. If in any case its advantage is not consulted,
  then the object for<br>  which it was delegated is frustrated—or in simple words,
  the measure which<br>  does not promote the public welfare is not right. It matters
  nothing whether<br>  the community have delegated specifically so much power for
  such and such<br>  purposes: the power,<br>  <em>being possessed,</em>  entails
  the obligation. Whether a sovereign derives absolute authority for a<br>  year,
  the principles of their duty are the same. The obligation to employ it<br>  only
  for the public good, is just as real and just as great in one case as in<br>  the
  other. The Russian and the Turk have the same right to require that the<br>  power
  of their rulers shall be so employed, as the Englishman or American.<br>  They may
  not be able to assert this right, but that does not affect its<br>  existence nor
  the ruler’s duty,—nor his responsibility to that<br>  <em>Almighty</em>  Being before
  whom he must give an account of his stewardship. These<br>  reasonings, if they
  needed confirmation, derive it from the fact that the<br>  Deity imperatively requires
  us, according to our opportunities, to<br>  <em>do good</em>  to man.<br></p><p>  But,
  how ready soever men are to admit the truth of this proposition as a<br>  proposition,
  it is very commonly disregarded in practice; and a vast variety<br>  of motives
  and objects direct the conduct of governments which have no<br>  connection with
  the public weal. Some<br>  <em>pretensions</em>  of consulting the public weal are,
  indeed, usual. It is not to be supposed<br>  that when public officers are pursuing
  their own schemes and interests, they<br>  will<br>  <em>tell</em>  the people that
  they disregarded theirs. When we look over the history of a<br>  christian nation,
  it is found that a large proportion of these measures which<br>  are most prominent
  in it, had little tendency to subserve, and did not<br>  subserve the public good.
  In practice it is very often forgotten for what<br>  purpose governments are instituted.
  If a man were to look over twenty<br>  treaties, he would probably find that half
  of them had very little to do with<br>  the welfare of the respective communities.
  He might find a great feal about<br>  Charles’ rights, and Frederick’s honor, and
  Louis’ possessions, and Francis’<br>  interests,—as if the proper subjects of international
  arrangements were those<br>  which respected rulers rather than communities. If
  a man looks over the state<br>  papers which inform him of the origin of a war,
  he will probably fund that<br>  they agitate questions about Most Christian and
  Most Catholic Kinds, and High<br>  Mightinesses, and Imperial Majesties,—questions,
  however, in which Frenchmen,<br>  and Spaniards, and Dutch, and Austrians, are very
  little interested or<br>  concerned, or at any rate much less interested than they
  are in avoiding the<br>  quarrel.<br></p><p>  Governments commonly trouble themselves
  unnecessarily and too much with the<br>  politics of other nations. A prince should
  turn his back towards other<br>  countries and his face towards his own,—just as
  the proper place of a<br>  landholder is upon his own estates and not upon his neighbor’s.
  If governments<br>  were wise, it would ere long be found, that a great portion
  of the endless and<br>  wearisome succession of treaties, and remonstrances, and
  embassies, and<br>  alliances, and memorials, and subsidies, might be dispensed
  with, with so<br>  little inconvenience, and so much benefit, that the world would
  wonder to<br>  think to what futile ends they had been busying and how needlessly
  they had<br>  been injuring themselves.<br></p><p>  No doubt, the immoral and irrational
  system of international politics which<br>  <em>generally</em>  obtains, makes the
  path of one government more difficult than it would<br>  otherwise be; and yet it
  is probable that the most efficacious way of inducing<br>  another government to
  attend to its proper business, would be to attend to our<br>  own. It is not sufficiently
  considered, nor indeed is it sufficiently<br>  <em>known</em>  , how powerful is
  the influence of uprightness and candor in conciliating the<br>  good officers of
  other men. Overreaching and chicanery in one person, induce<br>  overreaching and
  chicanery in another. Men distrust those whom they perceive<br>  to be unworthy
  of confidence. Real integrity is not without its vouched in the<br>  hearts of others;
  and they who maintain it are treated with confidence,<br>  because it is seen that
  confidence can be safely reposed. Besides, he who<br>  busies himself with the politics
  of foreign countries, like the busy bodies in<br>  a petty community does not fail
  to offend. In the last century, our own<br>  country was so much of a busy body,
  and had involved itself in such a<br>  multitude of treaties and alliances, that
  it was found, I believe, quite<br>  impossible to fulfil one without, by that very
  act, violating another. This,<br>  of course, would offend. In private life that
  man passes through the world<br>  with the least annoyance and the greatest satisfaction,
  who confines his<br>  attention to its proper business, that is, generally, to his
  own: and who can<br>  tell why the experience of nations should in this case by
  different from that<br>  of private men? In a rectified state of international affairs,
  half a dozen<br>  princes on a continent would have little more occasion to meddle
  with one<br>  another than half a dozen neighbors in a street.<br></p><p>  But indeed,<br>  <em>Communities</em>  frequently
  contribute to their own injury. If governors are ambitious, or<br>  resentful, or
  proud, so, often, are the people;—and the public good has often<br>  been sacrificed
  by the public, with astonishing preposterousness, to jealousy<br>  or vexation.
  Some merchants are angry at the loss of a branch of trade; they<br>  urge the government
  to interfere; memorials and remonstrances follow to the<br>  state of whom they
  complain;—and so, by that process of exasperation which is<br>  quite natural when
  people think that high language and a high attitude is<br>  politic, the nations
  soon begin to fight. The merchants applaud the spirit of<br>  their rulers,—while
  in one year they lose more by war than they would have<br>  lost by the want of
  the trade for twenty; and before peace returns, the nation<br>  has lost more than
  it would have lost by the continuance of the evil for<br>  twenty centuries. Peace
  at length arrives, and the government begins to devise<br>  means of repairing the
  mischiefs of the war. Both government and people<br>  reflect very complacently
  on the wisdom of their measures,—forgetting that<br>  their conduct is only that
  of a man who wantonly fractures his own leg with a<br>  club, and then boasts to
  his neighbors how dexterously he limps to a surgeon.<br></p><p>  Present expedients
  for present occasions, rather than a wide embracing and<br>  far-seeing policy,
  is the great characteristic of European politics. We are<br>  hucksters who cannot
  resist the temptation of a present sixpence, rather than<br>  merchants who wait
  for their profits for the return of a fleet. Si quaeris<br>  monumentum, circumspice.
  [If you are looking for a monument, look around.]<br>  Look at the condition of
  either of the continental nations, and consider what<br>  it might have been if
  even a short line of princes had attended to their<br>  proper business,—had directed
  their solicitude to the improvement of the moral<br>  and social and political condition
  of the people. Who has been more successful<br>  in this huckster policy than France?
  And what is France, and what are the<br>  French people at the present hour?—Why,
  as it respects real welfare they are<br>  not merely surpassed, they are left at
  an immeasurable distance, by a people<br>  who sprung up but as yesterday,—by a
  people whose land, within the memory of<br>  our grand-fathers, was almost a wilderness,
  long since France boasted of her<br>  greatness. Such results have a cause. It is
  not possible that systems of<br>  policy can be good, of which the effects are so
  bad. I speak not of particular<br>  measures or of individual acts of ill policy,—these
  are not likely to be the<br>  result of the condition of man,—but of the whole international
  system,—a<br>  system of irritability, and haughtiness, and temporary expedients;
  a system of<br>  most unphilosophical principles, and from which christianity is
  practically<br>  almost excluded. Here is the evidence of fact before us. We know
  what a<br>  sickening detail the history of Europe is. And it is obvious to remark,
  that<br>  the system which has given rise to such a history must be vicious and
  mistaken<br>  in its fundamental principles. The same class of history will continue
  to<br>  after generations unless these principles are changed,—unless philosophy
  and<br>  christianity obtain a greater influence in the practice of government;
  unless,<br>  in a word, governments are content to do their proper business, and
  to leave<br>  that which is not their business, undone.<br></p><p>  When such principles
  are acted upon we may reasonably expect a rapid<br>  advancement in the whole condition
  of the world. Domestic measures which are<br>  now postponed to the more stirring
  occupations of legislators, will be found<br>  to be of incomparably greater importance
  than they. A wise code of criminal<br>  law will be found to be of more consequence
  and interest than the acquisition<br>  of a million square miles of territory;—A
  judicious encouragement of general<br>  education will be of more value than all
  the “glory” that has been acquired<br>  from the days of Alfred till now. Of moral
  legislation, however it will be our<br>  after business to speak; Meanwhile the
  lover of mankind has some reason for<br>  gratulation in perceiving indications
  that governments will hereafter direct<br>  their attention more to the objects
  for which they are invested with power.<br>  The statesmen who promotes this improvement
  will be what many statesmen have<br>  been<br>  <em>called</em>  —a great man. That
  government only is great which promotes the prosperity of<br>  its own people; and
  that people only are prosperous, who are wise and happy.<br></p>'
