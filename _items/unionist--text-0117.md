transcription: "<p> Col. Stone, of the N.Y. Commercial Advertiser sports the following
  short paragraph upon the <em>Signs</em> in his vicinity. </p> <p> ☞ <em>Letter G!</em>
  —The letter G. placed within the five radii of a masonic star, is occasionally seen
  adorning a <em>tavern sign</em> of some worthy member of the brotherhood in the
  country. This said G. means <em>Geometry,</em> and we never knew a lodge to proceed
  farther than this first letter in the science. </p> "
