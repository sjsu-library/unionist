transcription: "<p>  We cannot consent to be drawn, as the Unionist seems desirous
  that we should<br>  be, into a lengthened controversy upon its favorite topic. The
  whole matter<br>  lies in a nut-shell, and the editor knows, or ought to know, what
  is the real<br>  matter in dispute—when confined to<br>  <em>that</em>  there is
  but little to be said on his side of the subject. It is only by<br>  multiplying
  words, and turning off the attention from the true merits of the<br>  debate, that
  the abolitionists can hope to obtain a hearing. No better<br>  evidence is wanted
  of the weakness of the cause than the confessions of the<br>  Genius of Temperance,
  that Abolition cannot hope to succeed without the<br>  destruction of the Colonization
  Society. That Society has effected the<br>  emancipation of many slaves, whereas
  abolitionism has not yet freed one.<br>  <em>By their fruits ye shall know them.</em>
  \ Let us suppose a [..]se—not a very probable one, it must be confessed, yet if<br>
  \ the abolitionists are to be believed they expect to see a part, at least, of<br>
  \ it fulfilled—and are laboring to bring it about—Suppose that every person<br>
  \ north of the Potomac and the Ohio rivers became an abolitionist—as dedicated<br>
  \ and fierce as Garrison himself—that those who are south of this line remain<br>
  \ just as they are—some few honorable to the Colonization Society, here and<br>
  \ there one [..]ling and anxious to be rid of his slaves, but the great majority<br>
  \ desirous to retain them. Now supposing such a […]e of public opinion—and<br>  with&nbsp;
  the&nbsp; Constitution directly in their teeth, what course, we<br>  ask, would
  the abolitionists most probably pursue? If they answer,<br>  <em>we do not know,</em>
  \ then they are laboring without any definite views—and if they<br>  <em>do know,</em>
  \ we should be very glad to be informed. The Unionist has rather inflated (and<br>
  \ probably mistaken) notions of its own importance. It brags of being admitted<br>
  \ to the private counsels of the leaders, which we must be permitted to doubt.<br>
  \ The Unionist is too young to be initiated into all the secrets of the sect.<br>
  \ Doubtless when Garrison, or his worthy friend from New York, passes along this<br>
  \ way, they pat the Editor on the head—call him a nice little fellow—let him<br>
  \ know some of the least important of their plans—tell him to be a good boy,<br>
  \ and, by the bye, he shall know more—and anon his vanity makes him believe he<br>
  \ is in their full confidence. As you would avoid disappointment, do not trust<br>
  \ it too strongly.<br></p><p>  The Unionist must excuse us from further notice for
  the present, and probably<br>  for some time to come. Congress meet this week, and
  some very important<br>  subjects will be brought up for discussion. We wish to
  listen, and, if<br>  possible, learn something of their merits.<br></p>"
