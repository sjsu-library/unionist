transcription: MISS CRANDALL’S SCHOOL.<br>The Brooklyn, Con., Unionist, as we had
  anticipated, confirms the fact that Miss Crandall’s School at Canterbury, instead
  of being closed, is increasing. Unless put down by mob law, there is no way in which
  the school is likely to be suppressed, previous to the sitting of the Supreme Court
  of Errors, next July.<br>The last Emancipator mentions that a minister of the gospel
  has recently been refused the privilege of preaching in the meeting house, on Canterbury
  green, because he had visited Miss Crandall’s School. The same account mentions
  that a physician, having been called to one of the pupils, in a case of emergency,
  gave notion that, in obedience to public sentiment, he should be obliged to decline
  any future call of the kind. We are inclined to think this latter item an accidental
  repetition of a circumstance, which, we believe, occurred some time past. We forget
  whether, or no, our readers were informed of it; or of the kindred circumstance
  that a poor washer-woman, though desirous of washing clothes for Miss Crandall’s
  family, was obliged to yield to the public sentiment of the village, which was outraged
  at so enormous a crime. As to pulling down the house, though we doubt not the existence
  of sufficient malice and tyranny on the part of a <em>few</em>, to be <em>gratified</em>
  with almost any outrage, we have no idea that any thing of the kind will be seriously
  attempted. Miss Crandall is gaining too many friends, and her persecutors incurring
  too much odium, even in that region, to admit the supposition.<br>
