transcription: "<em>Black Laws.—</em> The Charleston Mercury says, that South Carolina
  has a law identical with that recently passed in Connecticut, relating to instructing
  colored children, and censures the authorities for its non-execution. It seems,
  therefore, that the law savors too much of barbarism, to be enforced, even in the
  slave holding State of South Carolina.” <em>N.E. Review</em>"
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: The New England Review was another project in which John Greenleaf Whittier
  had an editorial presence.
