caption: Celia Burleigh (1826-1875) occupied the same pulpit in Brooklyn (CT) as Samuel
  J. May had during the Canterbury crisis. Her early death from cancer deprived her
  of her just fame. She was married to William H. Burleigh in the final years of his
  life. The Unitarian Church in Brooklyn is conducting ongoing research into her life.
