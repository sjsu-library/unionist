transcription: "<p>  *The Advertiser of the 19<br>  <sup>th</sup>  of last December
  contained the following article:<br></p><p>  <em>To all whom it may concern.</em>
  \ —From what we can learn, we have great reason to believe that a<br>  <em>determination</em>
  \ has been formed to BREAK UP the<br>  <em>negro school</em>  in Canterbury by some
  means or other in less than two months. We by no means<br>  wish to encourage such
  a determination. And we seriously hope that our belief<br>  is not sufficiently
  authorized.—The best way is to wait patiently and let the<br>  law take its own
  course, and to let all doubts as to its constitutionality be<br>  indulged to their
  utmost extent. The peaceable and undisturbed manner however,<br>  in which the Instructress
  has of late been permitted to go on with her school,<br>  in violation of a law
  which the<br>  <em>people</em>  of this state have deliberately enacted could hardly
  have been expected by<br>  her. And we have no hesitation in saying that but few
  towns in this or<br>  <em>any other</em>  State, would have shown so much forbearance
  towards such an establishment, as<br>  have the people of Canterbury. We were not
  aware until we were so informed by<br>  our correspondent last week, that the number
  of the scholars now in attendance<br>  at the abolition school was so great. We
  know that great efforts have been<br>  made by its abettors,<br>  <em>since the
  decision</em>  of Chief Justice Daggett, to fill up the benches of the school house,
  and to<br>  increase the grievances and insults of our citizens, but we did not
  know until<br>  recently that, those efforts had succeeded to the amount of “more
  than<br>  <em>thirty</em>  wenches,” who are sent from all quarters of the globe!<br></p>"
scholarlyNotes: "<em>   There has to be a term, other than disingenuous, for the Cyril
  of<br>  Alexandria-style crocodile tears, or the Trumpesque “dog whistle” to describe<br>
  \ this stuff.<br></em><em>  Kathleen Turner sent me “stochastic terrorism” and Marjorie
  Shelton “a wink<br>  and a nod”<br></em>"
commentary: Note here the insulting language of “wenches” but also the high number
  of thirty students, and their (alleged) internationalism!
