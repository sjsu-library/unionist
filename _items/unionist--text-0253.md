transcription: "<p> *The Advertiser of the 19 <sup>th</sup> of last December contained
  the following article: </p> <p> <em>To all whom it may concern.</em> —From what
  we can learn, we have great reason to believe that a <em>determination</em> has
  been formed to BREAK UP the <em>negro school</em> in Canterbury by some means or
  other in less than two months. We by no means wish to encourage such a determination.
  And we seriously hope that our belief is not sufficiently authorized.—The best way
  is to wait patiently and let the law take its own course, and to let all doubts
  as to its constitutionality be indulged to their utmost extent. The peaceable and
  undisturbed manner however, in which the Instructress has of late been permitted
  to go on with her school, in violation of a law which the <em>people</em> of this
  state have deliberately enacted could hardly have been expected by her. And we have
  no hesitation in saying that but few towns in this or <em>any other</em> State,
  would have shown so much forbearance towards such an establishment, as have the
  people of Canterbury. We were not aware until we were so informed by our correspondent
  last week, that the number of the scholars now in attendance at the abolition school
  was so great. We know that great efforts have been made by its abettors, <em>since
  the decision</em> of Chief Justice Daggett, to fill up the benches of the school
  house, and to increase the grievances and insults of our citizens, but we did not
  know until recently that, those efforts had succeeded to the amount of “more than
  <em>thirty</em> wenches,” who are sent from all quarters of the globe! </p> "
scholarlyNotes: "<em> There has to be a term, other than disingenuous, for the Cyril
  of Alexandria-style crocodile tears, or the Trumpesque “dog whistle” to describe
  this stuff. </em> <em> Kathleen Turner sent me “stochastic terrorism” and Marjorie
  Shelton “a wink and a nod” </em> "
commentary: Note here the insulting language of “wenches” but also the high number
  of thirty students, and their (alleged) internationalism!
