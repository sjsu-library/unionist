transcription: |-
  The latter part of a wise manâ€™s life is taken up in curing the follies,
  prejudices and false opinions he had contracted in the former.
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: This proverb would not hold in the case of the Burleigh brothers, nor
  to Prudence Crandall, all of whom maintained their radicalism and commitment into
  old age.
