transcription: "<p>   tt requires but little foresight or political discernment, to
  know what the   Democratic party in this State, will have to encounter, in the shape
  of a foe,   at the coming election. Thus far, the enemy has been sly in his movements,
  and   silent in his plans. But all this is only to give the more power and effect
  to   his attack, when it is made. </p> <p>   In various parts of the State, steps
  have already been taken by our opponents,   which cannot be misunderstood. The spirit
  of hostility is beginning to   manifest itself, and if the signs of the times do
  not deceive us, the votaries   of Democracy, have much to do to render permanent
  their glorious emancipation   from the galling chains of federalism. There is no
  danger, if our friends will   make a proper use of their strength. </p> <p>   In
  this county, we are stronger than we were last spring; and what is still   more
  cheering, we have the influence of the Unionist against us! </p> "
