transcription: 'ANOTHER PROSECUTION.—Miss Crandall and her sister were on Saturday
  last brought before Justice Adams, charged with the old offence of teaching “the
  base born Africans, unmindful of the highest behest which says, ‘let there be darkness.’”
  They were found guilty and required to procure bonds for their appearance at the
  County Court, now in session. No one appearing immediately to give the required
  bonds, the Court was adjourned until Monday, that they might have time to procure
  them. We cannot account for this wonderful forbearance on the part of the <em>honorable</em>
  prosecutors, unless we believe they fear a second imprisonment would bring upon
  their heads the indignation of the public, as it most certainly would. Whether this
  dismission of the prisoners was legal or not, we pretend not to decide. But what
  was the necessity of again arresting Miss C.? The case has been appealed to a higher
  tribunal, why bring it again to the County Court: Why this persecuting continually
  with vexatious suits, from which no good can result? Is it done for the purpose
  of extorting money from her? We only ask for information.—<em>Brooklyn Ct. Unionist</em>'
