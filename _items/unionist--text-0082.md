transcription: 'There is at present, in perfect operation, at the penitentiary, near
  Trenton, (N.J.) a machine for the purpose of punching holes in bars of iron. Seven
  holes can be perforated in one minute and a quarter through bars bars half an inch
  thick, each hole being one and a quarter inches diameter, and the bar perfectly
