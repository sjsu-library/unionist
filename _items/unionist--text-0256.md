transcription: <p>  Mr. Editor—When I look at the ‘signs of the times’ and realize
  the present<br>  political condition of this once boasted republic; when I behold
  institutions<br>  which have hitherto been our beauty and strength — withering beneath
  a<br>  Despot’s magic wand; when the cries of distress, are stifled only by the<br>  stentorian
  lungs of office-holders, huzzaing for their King; and when the<br>  liberties of
  a nation of Freemen seem to be at the mercy of a practical<br>  tyrant, I am led
  to exclaim with Caesar’s friend<br></p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  “<br>  <em>O judgment! Thou are fled to brutish beasts</em></p><p>  <em>    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  And men<br>    have lost their reason.”<br>  </em></p><p>  Well may Americans mourn
  over their suffering country; and weep over rights<br>  and privileges trampled
  upon. But other emotions better become FREEMEN. The<br>  present is not a time to
  indulge in hopeless grief. No. It is a time for<br>  <em>united</em>  and<br>  <em>vigorous</em>  action
  and I rejoice that we are yet free and CAN act. Is there an honest<br>  independent
  elector who cannot find motives enough to stimulate him to<br>  exertion? Shall
  this great people suffer all manner of oppression and not make<br>  an effort to
  free themselves from it? Shall the counsel of their<br>  Representatives be disregarded
  with impunity? Shall their petitions for relief<br>  be wholly rejected and their
  agents treated with gross indignity by the<br>  Executive Head of this nation?—There
  are motives enough and I trust they will<br>  have their legitimate influence. The
  first Monday of April which is just at<br>  hand is an important day to the Free
  Electors of this state. And let no one<br>  who pretends to be a FREEMAN say, that
  he is no politician and cares not for<br>  the result of the election. But let each
  one remember that he owes a duty to<br>  his country which he is bound to perform.
  Are you told by some officious<br>  office holder that our state election has nothing
  to do with Jacksonism,<br>  &amp;c. &amp;c.? Believe it not, it is mere deception.
  Let the Jackson ticket<br>  in this state prevail and the triumph of “the party”
  would be sounded by all<br>  the collar presses from the little Windham C. Advertiser
  up to the great<br>  official Globe. But let each elector who regards the well being
  of our free<br>  institutions, and who loves his country better than he does the
  flattery of<br>  fawning sycophants see to it that his ballot counts against the
  advocates of<br>  usurpation; and Connecticut is safe.<br></p><p align="right"><strong>N.P.</strong></p>
