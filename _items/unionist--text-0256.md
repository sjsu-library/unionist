transcription: '<p> Mr. Editor—When I look at the ‘signs of the times’ and realize
  the present political condition of this once boasted republic; when I behold institutions
  which have hitherto been our beauty and strength — withering beneath a Despot’s
  magic wand; when the cries of distress, are stifled only by the stentorian lungs
  of office-holders, huzzaing for their King; and when the liberties of a nation of
  Freemen seem to be at the mercy of a practical tyrant, I am led to exclaim with
  Caesar’s friend </p> <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  “ <em>O judgment! Thou are fled to brutish beasts</em> </p> <p> <em> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  And men have lost their reason.” </em> </p> <p> Well may Americans mourn over their
  suffering country; and weep over rights and privileges trampled upon. But other
  emotions better become FREEMEN. The present is not a time to indulge in hopeless
  grief. No. It is a time for <em>united</em> and <em>vigorous</em> action and I rejoice
  that we are yet free and CAN act. Is there an honest independent elector who cannot
  find motives enough to stimulate him to exertion? Shall this great people suffer
  all manner of oppression and not make an effort to free themselves from it? Shall
  the counsel of their Representatives be disregarded with impunity? Shall their petitions
  for relief be wholly rejected and their agents treated with gross indignity by the
  Executive Head of this nation?—There are motives enough and I trust they will have
  their legitimate influence. The first Monday of April which is just at hand is an
  important day to the Free Electors of this state. And let no one who pretends to
  be a FREEMAN say, that he is no politician and cares not for the result of the election.
  But let each one remember that he owes a duty to his country which he is bound to
  perform. Are you told by some officious office holder that our state election has
  nothing to do with Jacksonism, &amp;c. &amp;c.? Believe it not, it is mere deception.
  Let the Jackson ticket in this state prevail and the triumph of “the party” would
  be sounded by all the collar presses from the little Windham C. Advertiser up to
  the great official Globe. But let each elector who regards the well being of our
  free institutions, and who loves his country better than he does the flattery of
  fawning sycophants see to it that his ballot counts against the advocates of usurpation;
  and Connecticut is safe. </p> <p align="right"><strong>N.P.</strong></p> '
