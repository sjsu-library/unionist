  C. Burleigh, Editor and Proprietor.</p> <p align="center">PROSPECTUS</p> <p align="center">OF</p>
  <p align="center"><strong>THE UNIONIST.</strong></p> <p>At no time more than at
  the present, has been felt the want, in this county, of a firm, independent press.
  The acts of our last legislature are a sufficient index of the character of that
  party which has obtained, for a brief space we hope, the ascendancy in this State.
  We cannot, for a moment, believe that a majority of the people of Connecticut, approve
  <em>all</em> the recent enactments of our Legislature, but such has been and is
  still the course pursued by the only press existing in this county, that many of
  the people are probably unapprised of the spirit and tendency of their proceedings.
  It is too evident to be denied, that the Advertiser is so devoted to the policy
  of a party, and the aggrandizement of a few party leaders, that a fair discussion
  of the pretensions and measures of our prominent men, cannot find admission to its
  columns. Hence the necessity of another organ of communication to the public, on
  the great interests of the state and nation, which has brought the Unionist before
  the public.</p> <p>This paper will be pledged to no party, but will canvass the
  claims of all aspirants to the public favor, and all measures of public policy,
  on their own merits. On all the great questions upon which the mind of the community
  is divided, a free admission will be given to well and candidly written articles
  on both sides, if offered, but every thing of a scurrilous or abusive character
  will be excluded, come from what source it may.</p> <p>The Unionist will be the
  advocate of temperance, virtue and sound morality, and will pursue that course which
  a deep conviction of the truth of the sentiment contained in its motto points out.
  It will also contain items of general intelligence, literary selections and the
  usual variety of miscellaneous matter, and no effort will be spared on the part
  of the editor to make it worthy of the public favor. How far his efforts will succeed,
  the future course of the paper will determine.</p> <p>TERMS. - -Mail subscribers,
  $2, in advance. Delivered by stage, or post, one dollar and seventy-five cents.
  Those taken at the office, one dollar and fifty cents</p><p>No paper will be discontinued
  till arrearages are paid, except at the discretion of the publisher.</p><p>Advertisements
  inserted at the usual prices.</p><p>All communications addressed to the editor,
  post-paid.</p><p><em>Brooklyn,</em>, August 1, 1833.</p> '
