transcription: "<p>We learn from the Unionist, that Mr. Wm. Lloyd Garrison was arrested
  at the house of Mr. Benson in Brooklym, Sunday night, 27th ult. on five writs, at
  the suit of Col. Judson, Captain Fenner, Dr. Harris, Solomon Payne, and Rufus Adams.
  His friends gave bonds for his appearance before the County Court next December,
  to answer to the charge of having libelled the several Plaintiffs above named, in
  the account of the famous 9th of March town meeting, published in the Boston Liberator.</p>"
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: The Canterbury elite were incensed that their town meeting had become
  national news, and they were determined to drive Garrison away from their village.
  Little did they, or anyone at that moment, know that Garrison would end up marrying
  into the Benson family of Brooklyn, and using "Friendship Vale" as a refuge himself.
  The libel case never went to trial.
