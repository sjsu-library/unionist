caption: Transcribed title page of the 1850 edition of the <em>Narrative of Sojourner
  Truth, a Northern Slave</em>. Olive Gilbert, a white woman and charter member of
  the The Female Antislavery Society of Brooklyn (Connecticut), was the amanuensis
  to whom Sojourner Truth dictated her memoirs. While there are some just criticisms
  of a patronizing attitude on Gilbert's part towards Truth, the fact is that this
  very important document, by one of the greatest figures in American history, saw
  the light of day because of the friendship between Sojourner Truth and Olive Gilbert.
