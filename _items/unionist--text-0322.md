transcription: 'THE QUESTION SETTLED.----The Windham County Advertiser, (the determined
  opponent of Miss Crandall,) in speaking of the late trial of Mr. Olney, says—It
  “was a patient examination of facts, and <em>all who heard it admit that the fire
  was communicated by design.”</em> Very well. This settles one point, and we may
  say the only point in which the American public at large, have any particular interest:
  and we will add, that on that point, there is a most intense interest felt throughout
  the country. It is simply this—Whether the house of Miss Crandall took fire by accident,
  or whether it was fired by some person or persons, determined to <em>“break up”</em>
  the school. As to the miserable attempt to cast suspicion upon the friends of the
  school, it will be an utter failure. Nobody of sound mind and principles will listen
  to it. It is out of the question. Miss Crandall and her sister and pupils are too
  well known, and too <em>favorably and honorably</em> known throughout the land,
  to be made objects of suspicion. A similar remark might be made respecting Mr. Olney,
  who is well known in this city, and whose character is as unimpeachable and well
  established as Judge Eaton’s. Besides, he stands acquitted and “all” who heard the
  evidence, “admit that the fire was communicated BY DESIGN!!! <em>This settles the
  question forever,</em> before the impartial jury of the American public, who will
  of necessity infer <em>that</em> &nbsp;the fire was communicated by the same class
  of persons who pelted the house with stones and addled eggs, who filled the well
  with filth, and threatened to “break up the school.” For the honor of human nature,
  and especially of Windham county, (the land of our boyhood,) we had hoped that there
  would remain some ground for the opinion that the fire was <em>accidental.</em>
  We are sorry to learn, and from the source least likely to admit it, that such is
  not the fact. One question, however, of minor importance still remains to be settled,
  and that is <em>which</em> of all the persons in high life and in low, that have
  so virulently opposed the school of Miss Crandall, have been guilty of this base
  act? This question, which it concerns the decent and respectable portion of those
  opponents, chiefly to settle, is a question to which it would seem that the (fortunately
  for themselves,) possess no unmeaning clue. One of their members (the editor of
  the Advertiser) appears to have been favored, some time before hand, with intimation
  of the fact, that an attempt would be made to “break up the school.” Let him frankly
  reveal the source of his information, and let these informants be required to name
  <em>their</em> informants, and so on, and there is little doubt that those villains
  will be detected, and all honest men exculpated, at a cheaper rate than the adoption
  of useless and abortive measures to throw suspicion on the innocent.— <em>Emancipator</em> '
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: 'The author identifies himself as some one who grew up in Windham County.
  The editor of <em>The Emancipator</em> Charles Denison, is a potential candidate,
  having been born in New London county, but potentially having lived in Windham later.
  Likewise, African-American activist and theorist David Ruggles was an agent of the
  paper. Ruggles'' style matches this enthusiastic prose,The editorial prominently
  highlights the Black students as "<em>favorably and honorably</em> known throughout
  the land" as well as Prudence and Almira Crandall, a reframing of the usual publicity
  that indicates either a genuinely anti-racist white writer, or a Black writer whose
  position within the community would have made the students'' respectability obvious
  to him. '
