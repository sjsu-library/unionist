transcription: 'THE QUESTION SETTLED.----The Windham County Advertiser, (the determined
  opponent<br>of Miss Crandall,) in speaking of the late trial of Mr. Olney, says—It
  “was a<br>patient examination of facts, and<br><em>all who heard it admit that the
  fire was communicated by design.”</em>Very well. This settles one point, and we
  may say the only point in which the<br>American public at large, have any particular
  interest: and we will add, that on<br>that point, there is a most intense interest
  felt throughout the country. It is<br>simply this—Whether the house of Miss Crandall
  took fire by accident, or whether<br>it was fired by some person or persons, determined
  to<br><em>“break up”</em>the school. As to the miserable attempt to cast suspicion
  upon the friends of<br>the school, it will be an utter failure. Nobody of sound
  mind and principles<br>will listen to it. It is out of the question. Miss Crandall
  and her sister and<br>pupils are too well known, and too<br><em>favorably and honorably</em>known
  throughout the land, to be made objects of suspicion. A similar remark<br>might
  be made respecting Mr. Olney, who is well known in this city, and whose<br>character
  is as unimpeachable and well established as Judge Eaton’s. Besides, he<br>stands
  acquitted and “all” who heard the evidence, “admit that the fire was<br>communicated
  BY DESIGN!!!<br><em>This settles the question forever,</em>before the impartial
  jury of the American public, who will of necessity infer<br><em>that</em>&nbsp;the
  fire was communicated by the same class of persons who pelted the<br>house with
  stones and addled eggs, who filled the well with filth, and<br>threatened to “break
  up the school.” For the honor of human nature, and<br>especially of Windham county,
  (the land of our boyhood,) we had hoped that there<br>would remain some ground for
  the opinion that the fire was<br><em>accidental.</em>We are sorry to learn, and
  from the source least likely to admit it, that such<br>is not the fact. One question,
  however, of minor importance still remains to be<br>settled, and that is<br><em>which</em>of
  all the persons in high life and in low, that have so virulently opposed the<br>school
  of Miss Crandall, have been guilty of this base act? This question, which<br>it
  concerns the decent and respectable portion of those opponents, chiefly to<br>settle,
  is a question to which it would seem that the (fortunately for<br>themselves,) possess
  no unmeaning clue. One of their members (the editor of the<br>Advertiser) appears
  to have been favored, some time before hand, with intimation<br>of the fact, that
  an attempt would be made to “break up the school.” Let him<br>frankly reveal the
  source of his information, and let these informants be<br>required to name<br><em>their</em>informants,
  and so on, and there is little doubt that those villains will be<br>detected, and
  all honest men exculpated, at a cheaper rate than the adoption of<br>useless and
  abortive measures to thrown suspicion on the innocent.—<br><em>Emancipator</em>'
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: The author identifies himself as some one who grew up in Windham County.
  The editor of <em>The Emancipator</em> Charles Denison, is a potential candidate,
  having been born in New London county, but potentially having lived in Windham later.
  Likewise, African-American activist and theorist David Ruggles was an agent of the
  paper. Ruggles' style matches this enthusiastic prose,The editorial prominently
  highlights the Black students as "<em>favorably and honorably</em>known throughout
  the land" as well as Prudence and Almira Crandall, a reframing of the usual publicity
  that indicates either a genuinely anti-racist white writer, or a Black writer whose
  position within the community would have made the students' respectability obvious
  to him.<br>
