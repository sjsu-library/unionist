caption: Like many Abolitionists, William Jay was also a capable advocate of Peace,
  and was president of the American Peace Society for some years. This 1842 work was
  quite influential. Its republication in 1919 is indicative of the resurgence of
  pacifism after the outrageously profligate loss of life in World War I.
