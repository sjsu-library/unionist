transcription: "<p>A CARD.</p> <p>   In directing the attention of their readers to
  the improvements and exertions   that have been increasingly made, to elevate the
  Ladyâ€™s Book to that station   which it now occupies, the Proprietors have incurred
  a very considerable   expence [sic], which deserves on the subscribers, a suitable
  punctuality in   meeting   <em>their</em>   engagements. To them, individually,
  the amount of the subscription is a   trifle, but to the proprietors, it is, collectively,
  of the utmost importance;   and it is confidently expected that the early transmission
  of arrears, will   prove to them that their intentions and exertions have not been
  disregarded or   forgotten, by those for whom they have been made. </p> <p>   After
  the first of January it is the intention of the proprietors to send   circulars
  to all who are arrears one year. Subscribers wishing to avoid the   expense of postage,
  will please make payment before that time. </p> "
