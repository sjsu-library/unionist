transcription: "<em>Next Congress.</em> —The patriotic State of North Carolina will
  present an almost undivided phalanx at Washington next winter against Nullification.
  Carson is beaten, and there are but two members chosen whose course will run side
  and side with McDuffie &amp; Co. More than two thirds of the Delegation are friendly
  to the re-charter of the Bank. It gives us pleasure to learn that in the Fayetteville
  district, represented in the last Congress by Mr. Bethune, a semi-nullifier, the
  new member is both in favor of the Bank and Mr. Clay’s Land Bill. It is remarkable
  that Mr. Bethune was beaten by precisely the same majority that he was elected two
  years ago.— <em>Boston Atlas.</em> "
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: One of these defeated Congressman, Lauchlin Bethune, was a slave-owner;
  the other, Samuel Price Carson, was a slaveowner and had killed a man in a duel
  over a campaign insult.
