transcription: "<em>Next Congress.</em>—The patriotic State of North Carolina will
  present an almost undivided phalanx<br>at Washington next winter against Nullification.
  Carson is beaten, and there are<br>but two members chosen whose course will run
  side and side with McDuffie &amp;<br>Co. More than two thirds of the Delegation
  are friendly to the re-charter of the<br>Bank. It gives us pleasure to learn that
  in the Fayetteville district,<br>represented in the last Congress by Mr. Bethune,
  a semi-nullifier, the new<br>member is both in favor of the Bank and Mr. Clay’s
  Land Bill. It is remarkable<br>that Mr. Bethune was beaten by precisely the same
  majority that he was elected<br>two years ago.—<br><em>Boston Atlas.</em>"
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: One of these defeated Congressman, Lauchlin Bethune, was a slave-owner;
  the other, Samuel Price Carson, was a slaveowner and had killed a man in a duel
  over a campaign insult.
