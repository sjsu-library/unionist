  <p>ACQUITTAL OF MR. OLNEY.</p>
  <p>
    ☞We are gratified to learn, by the last number of the Unionist, printed at
    Brooklyn, that Mr. Frederick Olney, a reputable and truly excellent citizen of
    Norwich, who was taken up by Andrew T. Judson &amp; Co. on a charge of having
    fired Miss Crandall’s dwelling a few weeks since, has been acquitted. The
    Unionist says—‘The Jury would probably have given their verdict without
    leaving their seats, if they had previously chosen a foreman. But so
    soon&nbsp; as they had returned to their room and organized, they gave a
    unanimous vote in his favor.’ The same paper gives a long report of the trial,
    which shows that a more paltry and vile attempt to incriminate an honest man
    was never made in our land.
