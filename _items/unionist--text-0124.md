  <em>Kidnapping.</em>
  —A man of color, named John Hill, was brought before the police magistrate on
  Monday, charged with abduction, in taking away Sarah Jane Demons, a girl of
  color, aged six years, from the house of Emilia Smith, a woman of color, who
  resides at 99 Greenwich st. On Sunday evening three gentlemen observed the
  prisoner carrying a child, which was crying, and seemed very reluctant to be
  taken away. The gentlemen stopped Hill, and questioned him as to how he came in
  possession of the child. He gave them evasive answers, and they then inquired of
  the child where she lived. The little girl told them her place of residence, and
  signified her entire ignorance of the cause for which Hill had taken her away.
  The gentlemen considered the case sufficiently suspicious to warrant them in
  arresting the prisoner, and one of them, assisted by a man of color, named
  Bristol Martin, lodged him in prison, whilst the other restored the little girl
  to her friends. Hill’s explanation of the affair was, that he merely took the
  child to <em>give it some candy</em>. He had been seen the same evening endeavoring to take away another child, who,
  however, struggled so hard as to make him abandon his design. The occurrence
  created considerable excitement amongst the people of color in the city, a large
  number of whom attended to hear the case disposed of. Hill was committed to
  prison.—

scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: "Kidnapping of free Blacks in northern cities would have been a major
  fear for the students at the Canterbury Female Academy. This article, and the one
  preceding closely on it concerning kidnapping free Blacks into slavery, are from
  the New York <em>Journal of Commerce</em>, another journalistic innovation by Arthur
  Tappan, in partnership with Samuel Morse.\n\n"
