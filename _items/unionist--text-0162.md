transcription: "<p>  A FEW QUESTIONS—We do not wish to be impertinent, nor meddle
  with that which<br>  is none of our business—but we wish to ask a few questions,
  and we do it with<br>  a sincere desire to do good, whether we shall, to any extent,
  effect our<br>  object we leave for time to determine.”<br></p><p>“Is the holding
  of our fellow men in bondage a sin?”</p><p>  &nbsp;“Is it our duty ever to repent
  of sin, and if so, when? now or at some<br>  indefinite future?<br></p><p>  Do any
  clergymen who preach to their hearers the duty of&nbsp; immediate<br>  repentence
  oppose immediate emancipation, the immediate restoration of right<br>  to the slave
  who has long been robbed of his earnings and treated as a brute?<br>  and if so
  where is his consistency?<br></p><p>  Has God pronounced a judgment upon him who
  withholds from the laborer his<br>  hire? If so is the slaveholder obnoxious to
  this judgment?<br></p><p>Can that man who is a habitual robber be a christian?</p><p>
  \ Is not the slaveholder who refuses to emancipate his slaves a robber of man<br>
  \ and of God? Reader, ponder these questions well—and answer them to your<br>  conscience
  and your God.<br></p>"
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: With William Burleigh on board as a co-editor, I am not yet in a position
  to be able to distinguish between the two brothers on the basis of style. However,
  I would hazard a guess that this is William Burleigh, due to its more religiously-inflected
  tone.
