transcription: "<em>Metamorphosis.</em>—The paper formerly called “the Unionist,”
  published at Brookline, Ct. [sic]<br>comes out under the name of “Windham County
  Whig,” and says it is to be devoted<br>principally to politics. It was established
  to support Miss Prudence Crandall’s<br>school, and to oppose her opposers.<br>"
scholarlyNotes: I feel this is incorrect, as Garrison and others make reference to
  issues of <em>The Unionist</em> much later than this.
commentary: I feel this is incorrect, as Garrison and others make reference to issues
  of <em>The Unionist</em> much later than this.
