transcription: '<p>ANGELL’S SCHOOL BOOKS.</p><p>  Published by MARSHALL, BROWN, &amp;
  Co. Providence: MARSHALL, CLARK &amp; Co. <br>  Philadelphia. <br></p><p>THE UNION
  NO. 1, OR CHILD’S FIRST BOOK.</p><p>  The arrangement of the lessons in this book
  is such that the child commences <br>  reading as soon as he commences putting the
  letters together into syllables! <br>  the (sic) exercises of spelling and reading
  being simultaneous. The plan has <br>  met with the unqualified approbation of those
  teachers who have used it, and <br>  who have had an opportunity of expressing their
  opinions. <br></p><p><em>THE UNION NO. 2, OR CHILD’S SECOND BOOK.</em></p><p>  This
  is a continuation of the first number, containing easy reading lessons, <br>  most
  of which are pleasing stories, designed to interest the mind of the <br>  learner
  and afford instruction. <br></p><p><em>THE UNION NO. 3, OR CHILD’S THIRD BOOK</em></p><p>  This
  is a gradual advance from the second number, having the reading and <br>  spelling
  lessons arranged on the same plan. <br></p><p>  <em>THE UNION NO. 4.</em>  A neat
  stereotype edition, also designed as a reading and spelling book, and <br>  containing
  a variety of other useful matter. <br></p><p>  <em>THE UNION NO. 5.</em>  A reading
  book for the higher classes in common schools, with spelling lessons <br>  and definitions
  adapted to each reading section—with tables, mental <br>  arithmetic, &amp;c. <br></p><p><em>SELECT
  READER, OR UNION NO. 6</em></p><p>  Being a selection of pieces in prose and verse,
  which can scarcely fail to <br>  interest the mind, improve the heart and inform
  the understanding; accompanied <br>  with an explanatory Key, containing much useful
  information; and a large <br>  collection of verbal distinctions with illustrations.
  <br></p><p>  500 pp. Designed as a reading book for the highest classes in Academies
  and <br>  Schools. <br></p><p>  The whole forming a series of interesting, useful
  and economical school books. <br></p><p>  They have been through several large editions,
  and the publishers have had the <br>  whole series stereotyped, so that future editions
  will be uniform in every <br>  respect. They have spared neither pains nor expense
  to render these School <br>  Books worthy of attention. <br></p><p>  These books
  are used exclusively in the Providence public schools; have <br>  obtained an extensive
  circulation in Philadelphia and other parts of <br>  Pennsylvania. They have been
  introduced into most of the enterprising and <br>  intelligent country towns in
  Rhode-Island, and many towns in other parts of <br>  the United States. The publishers
  have the pleasure to state that not a single <br>  teacher, or other competent person
  has, to their knowledge, ever disapproved <br>  of these books after having fairly
  examined them. Numerous testimonials are in <br>  possession of the publishers,
  from which they select the following. <br></p><p align="center"><em>RECOMMENDATIONS</em></p><p>  At
  a meeting of the Providence School Committee, the following resolution was <br>  introduced
  by a Sub-Committee, appointed to examine and report what school <br>  books they
  consider best for the use of the public schools: <br></p><p>  “ <br>  <em>Resolved,</em>  That
  the arrangement and plan of the series of Common School Classics, <br>  compiled
  by Mr. Angell, meet our approbation.” <br></p><p>  Signed, WM.R. STAPLES, DAVID

  WATCHEMOKET <br>  FARM, 30<sup>th</sup>  Aug, 1833 <br></p><p>  Dear Sir:—Among
  my political engagements, I have always found some leisure <br>  moments left me
  for literary amusement. The employment of the School Master, <br>  once so useful
  and dear to me, does now, at times, call me back to the <br>  examination of letters,
  syllables, words, spellings and readings. Perhaps I <br>  mingle with all these
  some political considerations; for I confess, that my <br>  anxiety for the preservation
  and perpetuation of our Union and National <br>  Government, is so great, that I
  often ardently wish all the children in the <br>  United States could be taught
  to read from the same set of books. Not because <br>  this might give a uniformity
  of pronunciation throughout the country, so <br>  desirable to Poets and Orators;
  but more than this, because the same juvenile <br>  literature studied and read,
  in the same language, would go far to give to <br>  each succeeding generation not
  only the same knowledge, but something like a <br>  brotherhood of feelings, sentiments,
  and opinions, than could, in any other <br>  way be obtained. I know you as a citizen,
  feel a deep interest in all this; <br>  and because you, as one of the highly useful
  and laborious fraternity of <br>  Printers and venders of books, may have a peculiar
  interest in some of those <br>  put forth for the instruction of children, I shall,
  at this time, press on <br>  your attention this subject in connexion with the best
  which I have yet seen. <br></p><p>  Our worthy fellow-citizen, Mr. Oliver Angell,
  seems to have had purposes much <br>  akin to my wishes, when he composed and published
  his system of classics for <br>  children. He had named his books the “Union;” and
  if you look quite through <br>  them, you will find nothing in the whole, for the
  reading of children, but <br>  that spirit and those principles which alone can
  preserve the Union, the <br>  purest morals, piety and patriotism. There is, also,
  a progression in the <br>  readings found in these books, admirably contrived to
  go along with that of <br>  the human mind in its growth from childhood up to perfect
  maturity. <br></p><p>  In mere orthography, the alphabet, the vowels, consonants,
  dipthongs, <br>  syllables, spellings, perhaps Mr. Angell might have done better
  for the <br>  <em>Instructor</em>  who may use his books; but after all, it will
  be found doubtful if any one can <br>  do better for the <br>  <em>Pupil</em>  for
  whom this good man seems alone to have been solicitous. The Instructor <br>  should
  carry in his head, the correct pronunciation of every word in our <br>  spoken language,
  and a key for all the various sounds of every letter in all <br>  its various combinations
  whenever he looks at that language as it is printed <br>  or written. <br></p><p>  We
  have more vowels in our spoken than in our printed or written language; and <br>  those
  who compose spelling books have supplied the deficiency by figures added <br>  to
  the printed character of each vowel. These Algebraic vowels, half letter, <br>  half
  figure, used in spelling books, are not printed in books of any other <br>  kind;
  so that a child, though he may have learned the different sounds of the <br>  printed
  vowels and can pronounce them when he spells; yet when he comes to <br>  read in
  other books, where one half of each vowel is omitted and it becomes <br>  thereby
  a new letter, he knows not how to pronounce it; and he must, at last, <br>  learn
  its different sounds in the different combinations of each with other <br>  letters.
  This would have been easier done, at first, when he was spelling, <br>  than, at
  last, when he is reading. Last or first, he must learn them, from the <br>  Instructor,
  or from the dictionary; and the Algebraic vowels, called the key, <br>  while useful
  to the Instructors themselves not well instructed, may be <br>  detrimental to the
  pupil. On the whole, I have seen no system of School Books <br>  equal, or any where
  near equal to Mr. Angell’s Union; and I think if they <br>  could be universally
  used in our English Schools in the whole country, our <br>  children would become
  not only better scholars, but better patriots, not less <br>  citizens of Rhode-Island,
  or South-Carolina and more citizens of the United <br>  States. <br></p><p>I am
  dear Sir, very truly, your obedient servant.</p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <br>  TRISTAM BURGES. <br></p><p>  <em>From the Preceptors of the Public Schools
  in the City of Providence</em></p><p>  We have used Mr. Angell’s series of school
  books, for nearly one eyar; and <br>  from this long trial we can say with confidence
  that we believe them admirably <br>  suited to answer the purposes for which they
  were composed. From our <br>  examination of the inferior numbers, which are used
  in the primary Schools, we <br>  believe them also to be no less useful. As reading
  books, they all combine in <br>  our opinion, many peculiar excellencies. The first,
  which will strike all who <br>  use them, is their perfect <br>  <em>adaptation</em>  to
  the <br>  <em>capacities</em>  of those for whom they were designed. This, we consider
  a most important <br>  advantage in an elementary book, and one which has not been
  heretofore <br>  sufficiently attended to. <br></p><p>  The books put into the hands
  of children at school have generally been <br>  altogether <br>  <em>above the understanding</em>  of
  the young mind; and the consequence has been, that the scholars have noy <br>  only
  made much less progress in a given time, but have acquired the lasting <br>  <em>disgust</em>  for
  their studies which has operated as an effectual bar to future <br>  improvement.
  To this great and extensive evil, Mr. Angell’s books afford a <br>  <em>certain
  and easy remedy.</em>  The facility with which his lessons are <br>  <em>understood</em>  added
  to their very interesting nature, causes them to be read by the scholar <br>  with
  eagerness and delight; by which means his love of study and his <br>  improvement
  in learning are both successfully promoted. The introduction of <br>  spelling lessons,
  in connection with reading lessons, into all the books, is <br>  an advantage which
  they possess over those previously in use. This <br>  arrangement, by enabling the
  pupil to become acquainted with each separate <br>  word, immediately before he
  is called to read them, is well calculated to <br>  render that exercise correct
  and pleasing, at the same time that it renders <br>  orthography a less dry and
  uninteresting study than the usual mode. It also <br>  considerably promotes economy
  by rendering the purchase of a separate spelling <br>  book unnecessary. The <br>  <em>appending
  of questions</em>  to each reading lesson we consider a very valuable improvement,
  since, by <br>  calling the attention of the pupil more closely to the subject,
  it will lead <br>  him to a better understanding of what is read. The natural gradation
  from what <br>  is easy, to what is more difficult, which is observed throughout
  this whole <br>  series, is a circumstance that renders them peculiarly valuable.
  Entertaining <br>  these opinions, we cheerfully recommend them to the attention
  of teachers and <br>  others interested in the cause of education; confident, that
  to all who are <br>  aware how much success in teaching depends upon proper books,
  they will be <br>  peculiarly acceptable. P.W. FERRIS, E.W. BAKER, ESEK ALDRICH,

  the Com.</em></p><p>PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 28. 1833.</p><p>  Gentlemen—I have examined
  with much care and satisfaction, the series of <br>  “Angell’s School Classics,”
  with which you were pleased to present me, and <br>  have not the slightest hesitation
  to pronounce it just such a set of reading <br>  books as has long been wanted in
  our schools. It is my intention, as soon as <br>  practicable, to adopt the whole
  series as standard reading books for my <br>  classes, and I doubt not that if the
  necessary exertions be made by those <br>  interested, they will ere long become
  a favorite standard in all our schools. <br>  I most cheerfully recommend them to
  the serious and immediate attention of my <br>  Philadelphia co-laborers in the
  field of Education. Very respectfully—Your <br>  ob’t Servant, J. O’CONNER. Principal
  of the Classical and English Academy, <br>  rear of St. Stephen’s Church, and Recording
  Secretary of the “Philadelphia <br>  Association of Teachers.” <br></p><p>  <em>    From
  Robert Vaux, Esq. of Philadelphia, who was for a number of years <br>    President
  of the Board of Controllers of the Public Schools for the City and <br>    County
  of Philadelphia. <br>  </em></p><p>  TO MARSHALL, CLARK &amp; CO. SCHOOL BOOK PUBLISHERS,
  PHILADELPHIA. In <br>  compliance with your request, I have examined “ <br>  <em>Angell’s
  Union Series of Common School Classics,”</em>  and entertain a very favorable opinion
  of the work. It comprises a course of <br>  elementary lessons on simple and practical
  principles, and so far as I can <br>  discover, imparts throughout, knowledge to
  instruct the understanding and to <br>  purify the heart. In common with all productions
  of like character I could <br>  wish for extensive circulation in our country. ROBERT
  VAUX. <br></p><p>  <em>    From Roswell C. Smith, Esq. Author of “Practical and
  Mental Arithmetic,” <br>    “Productive Grammar,” “Introductory Arithmetic,” &amp;c.
  <br>  </em></p><p>  From an impression, received and corroborated by a long continued
  course of <br>  instruction, in regard to the best methods of communicating knowledge
  to the <br>  youthful mind, I am free to confess that the Spelling and reading Books,
  of <br>  which Mr. Oliver Angell is the author, are not excelled, in their adaption
  to <br>  the purposes for which they are intended by any other books with which
  I am <br>  acquainted. Their prominent characteristic is simplicity; and when the
  public <br>  mind has taken the stand, to which it seems rapidly advancing, that
  children <br>  and youth must understand what they read and what they learn, then
  at least <br>  the works of Mr. Angell will receive that patronage, which they so
  eminently <br>  deserve. This testimony in favor of that gentleman is designed not
  as a mere <br>  puff; but as a just tribute of praise to one who has labored long
  and <br>  faithfully for the public good. ROSWELL C. SMITH. <br></p><p>Hampton,
