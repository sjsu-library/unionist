  Co. Providence: MARSHALL, CLARK &amp; Co. Philadelphia. </p> <p>THE UNION NO. 1,
  OR CHILD’S FIRST BOOK.</p> <p> The arrangement of the lessons in this book is such
  that the child commences reading as soon as he commences putting the letters together
  into syllables! the (sic) exercises of spelling and reading being simultaneous.
  The plan has met with the unqualified approbation of those teachers who have used
  it, and who have had an opportunity of expressing their opinions. </p> <p><em>THE
  UNION NO. 2, OR CHILD’S SECOND BOOK.</em></p> <p> This is a continuation of the
  first number, containing easy reading lessons, most of which are pleasing stories,
  designed to interest the mind of the learner and afford instruction. </p> <p><em>THE
  UNION NO. 3, OR CHILD’S THIRD BOOK</em></p> <p> This is a gradual advance from the
  second number, having the reading and spelling lessons arranged on the same plan.
  </p> <p> <em>THE UNION NO. 4.</em> A neat stereotype edition, also designed as a
  reading and spelling book, and containing a variety of other useful matter. </p>
  <p> <em>THE UNION NO. 5.</em> A reading book for the higher classes in common schools,
  with spelling lessons and definitions adapted to each reading section—with tables,
  mental arithmetic, &amp;c. </p> <p><em>SELECT READER, OR UNION NO. 6</em></p> <p>
  Being a selection of pieces in prose and verse, which can scarcely fail to interest
  the mind, improve the heart and inform the understanding; accompanied with an explanatory
  Key, containing much useful information; and a large collection of verbal distinctions
  with illustrations. </p> <p> 500 pp. Designed as a reading book for the highest
  classes in Academies and Schools. </p> <p> The whole forming a series of interesting,
  useful and economical school books. </p> <p> They have been through several large
  editions, and the publishers have had the whole series stereotyped, so that future
  editions will be uniform in every respect. They have spared neither pains nor expense
  to render these School Books worthy of attention. </p> <p> These books are used
  exclusively in the Providence public schools; have obtained an extensive circulation
  in Philadelphia and other parts of Pennsylvania. They have been introduced into
  most of the enterprising and intelligent country towns in Rhode-Island, and many
  towns in other parts of the United States. The publishers have the pleasure to state
  that not a single teacher, or other competent person has, to their knowledge, ever
  disapproved of these books after having fairly examined them. Numerous testimonials
  are in possession of the publishers, from which they select the following. </p>
  <p align="center"><em>RECOMMENDATIONS</em></p> <p> At a meeting of the Providence
  School Committee, the following resolution was introduced by a Sub-Committee, appointed
  to examine and report what school books they consider best for the use of the public
  schools: </p> <p> “ <em>Resolved,</em> That the arrangement and plan of the series
  of Common School Classics, compiled by Mr. Angell, meet our approbation.” </p> <p>

  WATCHEMOKET FARM, 30 <sup>th</sup> Aug, 1833 </p> <p> Dear Sir:—Among my political
  engagements, I have always found some leisure moments left me for literary amusement.
  The employment of the School Master, once so useful and dear to me, does now, at
  times, call me back to the examination of letters, syllables, words, spellings and
  readings. Perhaps I mingle with all these some political considerations; for I confess,
  that my anxiety for the preservation and perpetuation of our Union and National
  Government, is so great, that I often ardently wish all the children in the United
  States could be taught to read from the same set of books. Not because this might
  give a uniformity of pronunciation throughout the country, so desirable to Poets
  and Orators; but more than this, because the same juvenile literature studied and
  read, in the same language, would go far to give to each succeeding generation not
  only the same knowledge, but something like a brotherhood of feelings, sentiments,
  and opinions, than could, in any other way be obtained. I know you as a citizen,
  feel a deep interest in all this; and because you, as one of the highly useful and
  laborious fraternity of Printers and venders of books, may have a peculiar interest
  in some of those put forth for the instruction of children, I shall, at this time,
  press on your attention this subject in connexion with the best which I have yet
  seen. </p> <p> Our worthy fellow-citizen, Mr. Oliver Angell, seems to have had purposes
  much akin to my wishes, when he composed and published his system of classics for
  children. He had named his books the “Union;” and if you look quite through them,
  you will find nothing in the whole, for the reading of children, but that spirit
  and those principles which alone can preserve the Union, the purest morals, piety
  and patriotism. There is, also, a progression in the readings found in these books,
  admirably contrived to go along with that of the human mind in its growth from childhood
  up to perfect maturity. </p> <p> In mere orthography, the alphabet, the vowels,
  consonants, dipthongs, syllables, spellings, perhaps Mr. Angell might have done
  better for the <em>Instructor</em> who may use his books; but after all, it will
  be found doubtful if any one can do better for the <em>Pupil</em> for whom this
  good man seems alone to have been solicitous. The Instructor should carry in his
  head, the correct pronunciation of every word in our spoken language, and a key
  for all the various sounds of every letter in all its various combinations whenever
  he looks at that language as it is printed or written. </p> <p> We have more vowels
  in our spoken than in our printed or written language; and those who compose spelling
  books have supplied the deficiency by figures added to the printed character of
  each vowel. These Algebraic vowels, half letter, half figure, used in spelling books,
  are not printed in books of any other kind; so that a child, though he may have
  learned the different sounds of the printed vowels and can pronounce them when he
  spells; yet when he comes to read in other books, where one half of each vowel is
  omitted and it becomes thereby a new letter, he knows not how to pronounce it; and
  he must, at last, learn its different sounds in the different combinations of each
  with other letters. This would have been easier done, at first, when he was spelling,
  than, at last, when he is reading. Last or first, he must learn them, from the Instructor,
  or from the dictionary; and the Algebraic vowels, called the key, while useful to
  the Instructors themselves not well instructed, may be detrimental to the pupil.
  On the whole, I have seen no system of School Books equal, or any where near equal
  to Mr. Angell’s Union; and I think if they could be universally used in our English
  Schools in the whole country, our children would become not only better scholars,
  but better patriots, not less citizens of Rhode-Island, or South-Carolina and more
  citizens of the United States. </p> <p>I am dear Sir, very truly, your obedient
  servant.</p> <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  TRISTAM BURGES. </p> <p> <em>From the Preceptors of the Public Schools in the City
  of Providence</em> </p> <p> We have used Mr. Angell’s series of school books, for
  nearly one year; and from this long trial we can say with confidence that we believe
  them admirably suited to answer the purposes for which they were composed. From
  our examination of the inferior numbers, which are used in the primary Schools,
  we believe them also to be no less useful. As reading books, they all combine in
  our opinion, many peculiar excellencies. The first, which will strike all who use
  them, is their perfect <em>adaptation</em> to the <em>capacities</em> of those for
  whom they were designed. This, we consider a most important advantage in an elementary
  book, and one which has not been heretofore sufficiently attended to. </p> <p> The
  books put into the hands of children at school have generally been altogether <em>above
  the understanding</em> of the young mind; and the consequence has been, that the
  scholars have noy only made much less progress in a given time, but have acquired
  the lasting <em>disgust</em> for their studies which has operated as an effectual
  bar to future improvement. To this great and extensive evil, Mr. Angell’s books
  afford a <em>certain and easy remedy.</em> The facility with which his lessons are
  <em>understood</em> added to their very interesting nature, causes them to be read
  by the scholar with eagerness and delight; by which means his love of study and
  his improvement in learning are both successfully promoted. The introduction of
  spelling lessons, in connection with reading lessons, into all the books, is an
  advantage which they possess over those previously in use. This arrangement, by
  enabling the pupil to become acquainted with each separate word, immediately before
  he is called to read them, is well calculated to render that exercise correct and
  pleasing, at the same time that it renders orthography a less dry and uninteresting
  study than the usual mode. It also considerably promotes economy by rendering the
  purchase of a separate spelling book unnecessary. The <em>appending of questions</em>
  to each reading lesson we consider a very valuable improvement, since, by calling
  the attention of the pupil more closely to the subject, it will lead him to a better
  understanding of what is read. The natural gradation from what is easy, to what
  is more difficult, which is observed throughout this whole series, is a circumstance
  that renders them peculiarly valuable. Entertaining these opinions, we cheerfully
  recommend them to the attention of teachers and others interested in the cause of
  education; confident, that to all who are aware how much success in teaching depends
  upon proper books, they will be peculiarly acceptable. P.W. FERRIS, E.W. BAKER,

  with much care and satisfaction, the series of “Angell’s School Classics,” with
  which you were pleased to present me, and have not the slightest hesitation to pronounce
  it just such a set of reading books as has long been wanted in our schools. It is
  my intention, as soon as practicable, to adopt the whole series as standard reading
  books for my classes, and I doubt not that if the necessary exertions be made by
  those interested, they will ere long become a favorite standard in all our schools.
  I most cheerfully recommend them to the serious and immediate attention of my Philadelphia
  co-laborers in the field of Education. Very respectfully—Your ob’t Servant, J. O’CONNER.

  From Robert Vaux, Esq. of Philadelphia, who was for a number of years President
  of the Board of Controllers of the Public Schools for the City and County of Philadelphia.
  </em> </p> <p> TO MARSHALL, CLARK &amp; CO. SCHOOL BOOK PUBLISHERS, PHILADELPHIA.
  In compliance with your request, I have examined “ <em>Angell’s Union Series of
  Common School Classics,”</em> and entertain a very favorable opinion of the work.
  It comprises a course of elementary lessons on simple and practical principles,
  and so far as I can discover, imparts throughout, knowledge to instruct the understanding
  and to purify the heart. In common with all productions of like character I could
  wish for extensive circulation in our country. ROBERT VAUX. </p> <p> <em> From Roswell
  C. Smith, Esq. Author of “Practical and Mental Arithmetic,” “Productive Grammar,”
  “Introductory Arithmetic,” &amp;c. </em> </p> <p> From an impression, received and
  corroborated by a long continued course of instruction, in regard to the best methods
  of communicating knowledge to the youthful mind, I am free to confess that the Spelling
  and reading Books, of which Mr. Oliver Angell is the author, are not excelled, in
  their adaption to the purposes for which they are intended by any other books with
  which I am acquainted. Their prominent characteristic is simplicity; and when the
  public mind has taken the stand, to which it seems rapidly advancing, that children
  and youth must understand what they read and what they learn, then at least the
  works of Mr. Angell will receive that patronage, which they so eminently deserve.
  This testimony in favor of that gentleman is designed not as a mere puff; but as
  a just tribute of praise to one who has labored long and faithfully for the public
  good. ROSWELL C. SMITH. </p> <p>Hampton, February 12, 1833.</p> <p> ☞Teachers, School
