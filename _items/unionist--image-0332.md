caption: Dalip Singh Saund (1899-1973) was the first Asian-American Congressperson,
  a Democrat representing California's Imperial Valley, where he had previously worked
  as a farmer. He identified with the immigrant Sikh community, coming to the United
  States in 1920. Many Sikhs were agriculturalists, helping to cultivate the massive
  rice crop for which California is now famous. I imagine that the Burleigh brothers
  would have appreciated Saund's achievement, from many perspectives.
