caption: This glass was collected during archeological digs at the Canterbury Female
  Academy conducted during the COVIDian times of 2020-2022. It is most likely from
  the rash of broken windows that marked the attack that led to the closure of the
  school. Courtesy of Joan DiMartino and the Canterbury Female Academy. Photography
