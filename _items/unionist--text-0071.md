  </p> <p>   THIS institution commenced its summer term on the 16   <sup>th</sup>   of
  May last, under the care of Mr. KEEP, Principal, and Mr CLARK assistant. </p> <p>   Plainfield,
  in point of ease of access, healthiness and pleasantness of   situation, and other
  considerations favorable to the locality of a school, is,   it is believed, surpassed
  by but few towns in the state. The building is a two   story edifice of stone, finely
  situated on an eminence a little out of the   village, and arranged to accommodate
  a large number of students. </p> <p>   Board, including washing and ordinary mending,
  can be obtained in respectable   families, at $1,50 per week. </p> <p>Rates of Entrance
  and Tuition as follows, viz:â€”</p> <p>Entrance 1,00.</p> <p>   Reading, Writing,
  Elements of English Grammar, Elements of Arithmetic, per   term, [of 15 weeks] 4,00.
  </p> <p>   Any of the above, with Geography, Surveying, Navigation and Book-keeping,   5,00.
  </p> <p>   Any of the above, with the Languages or higher branches of Mathematics,
  6,00. </p> '
