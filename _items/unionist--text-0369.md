transcription: "<p>THE PEOPLE’S MAGAZINE</p> <p> This work is published twice a month,
  is furnished to subscribers at $1 a year. It contains a large mass of information,
  and is designed as an amusing and instructive miscellany for families. Each number
  is illustrated by a number of beautiful engravings on wood, illustrative of some
  object of interest, some incident in history, or some scene described in the work.
  The publishers have the satisfaction to state that the number of subscribers is
  now about 15,000; and while about 200 journals in the United States have expressed
  their approbation of it, we know of no instance in which an unfavorable opinion
  has been expressed. </p> <p> We state these circumstances, in the hope of extending
  the interest in a work, which is calculated to be of extensive utility. It is among
  the cheapest periodicals of the United States. </p> <p> The price of this Magazine
  is one dollar a year—six copies for $5—20 copies for fifteen dollars—or twenty-five
  quarterly parts for five dollars. Payment in all cases to be made in advance. </p>
  <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
