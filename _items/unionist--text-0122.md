transcription: "<em>Another suspected case of Kidnapping.</em>—Two or three attempts
  to kidnap, here and at Philadelphia, have been recently recorded, and we fear we
  have now to add another. Mary, a colored woman aged 21,<br>a native of Africa, and
  for the last 9 months a resident in the family of Isaac<br>L. Fuller, [colored],
  attended the methodist church in Church street last Sunday<br>evening as usual,
  since which she has not been heard of. As she never before<br>kept irregular hours,
  and two or three days have elapsed without throwing any<br>light upon the cause
  of her sudden disappearance, Mr. Fuller is strongly<br>apprehensive that she has
  been kidnapped. She speaks very little English, having<br>been landed on our shores
  by a vessel from a foreign port less than a year ago.<br>There is a remarkable streak
  extending down the centre of her forehead, nose and<br>chin. Any information which
  can be given concerning her will be thankfully<br>received by Mr. Fuller, No. 33.
  Thomas st.—<br><em>Jour. of Com.</em>"

commentary: |
  Kidnapping of free Blacks in northern cities would have been a major fear for the students at the Canterbury Female Academy. This article, and the one following closely on it concerning kidnapping free Blacks into slavery, are from the New York
  <em>Journal of Commerce</em>, another journalistic innovation by Arthur Tappan, in partnership with Samuel Morse.
