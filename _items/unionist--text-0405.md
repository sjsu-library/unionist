transcription: "A new paper called “The Unionist” has commenced at Brooklyn. Con.
  by Charles C. Burleigh, Esq., a gentleman of learning and talents. It is “pledged
  to no party” but promises to advocate “temperance, virtue, and sound morality.”
  We are pleased to add, for the credit of Windham County, (in which, by the bye,
  the writer of this paragraph spent several of his earlier years) that the disgraceful
  proceedings at Canterbury and the mockery of law enacted to shield and sustain them,
  are treated according to their merits, in the columns of the Unionist. We wish it
  success. And may the Putnams of that region ever be shrewd in tracing public pests
  to their dark retreats, and bold in dragging them forth to the day light, regardless
  of their fiery eyes, and their growling.\r A liberal support to the Unionist would
  do much towards retrieving the character of Connecticut from the disgrace cast upon
  it, by A.T. Judson, and his associates.\r  "
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: It is interesting that William Goodell - who had helped to launch Charles
  Burleigh to this editorship by publishing his letter to the editor back in May of
  1833, should disclose his local connection to Windham county.
