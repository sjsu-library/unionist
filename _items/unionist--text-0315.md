transcription: '<p>   It is almost mathematically certain that the Colonization Society
  with its   present sentiments and organization, can never effect the abolition of
  slavery   in the United States. This Society was organized, January 14, 1817. During
  the   seventeen years of its existence it has, (free blacks aside) transported on
  an   average almost sixty a year who had been slaves, but which were not   emancipated
  by the society. The increase of our slave population is known to   be about 60 thousand
  a year, or about 170 a day. Should things continue in   this ratio, it may be seen,
  that while the society (bankruptcy of $40,000   aside) is transporting one emancipated
  black to Liberia, which it has done   nothing toward manumitting, more than a thousand
  have been added by births!   When a distinguished friend, therefore, of the society
  acknowledges that if   the society should remove the whole in a hundred years it
  is as soon as could   reasonably be expected, has he not fixed the period quite
  too soon? Would not   the end of time be quite a probable? Besides, who can doubt
  that from a   population of 2,000,000 as many as that would have been manumnitted
  had no   such society existed. And had the funds which have been expended for their   outfit,
  transportation, and mal-administration of the colony, been   appropriated to their
  education and comfortable settlement in this their   native country, how much more
  honorable as well as righteous in those who have   so long and sorely oppressed
  them! </p> <p>   A New-England citizen thinks he has presented the public with a
  good offset to   calculations like the above, by stating that Mr. G. (the American
  Wilberforce)   has been engaged for several years, and the Anti-Slavery society
  two years and   have emancipated one boy in Boston. And thinks the enquiry "When
  will the   society remove the entire population of our country?” will apply with
  more   force to the Anti-Slavery society, than that of the Colonization. And   especially
  (he thinks) as when it is remembered that laws preventing   emancipation and oppressing
  the colored people, have been passed in many   states since the Liberator and other
  similar publications have been in   circulation. But who does not see a wide difference
  in the prospective view of   these societies? As the Colonization Society disavows
  any intention to   interfere with the RIGHT of the slave holder, why, of course,
  he may dwell in   peaceable fellowship with him forever, whether he is willing to
  release   another slave or not. Now the Anti-slavery Society not only avows for
  its   object the abolition of slavery entirely, but its object is to act on the   entire
  population EN MASSE whose prerogative it is to remove oppressive laws,   and to
  awaken and correct public sentiment on this subject, against which no   system of
  wickedness can long hold out, whether legalised or not. The   emancipation of the
  boy in Boston therefore, is but an incidental affair;   while at the same time it
  is a test of the society’s sincerity and efficiency.   Should the Colonization Society
  ever exceed the prescribed limits of their   object, so as to turn their attention
  to an enslaved boy in Boston or   elsewhere, it will doubtless refuse to incur the
  expense and trouble of a   prosecution and wait patiently the pleasure of his holder
  to voluntarily   release him, which perhaps will be at the termination of the slave’s
  life. </p> <p>   While therefore, the above mentioned case is a test of the vigor
  of the   society, it may also stand like the Egyptian which Moses slew and the Hebrew   which
  he defended, prelusive of the final and complete deliverance of that   unhappy and
  enslaved people. He supposed that his brethren would by his hand   deliver them;
  “<em>but they understood it not.</em>” As to the oppressive laws enacted since the
  efforts of the friends of   liberty, I should hardly have thought that a man with
  the views and feelings   of a New-England man would have dared to utter them, as
  it cannot fail to call   up to the mind of every reader the policy of Pharaoh and
  his counsellors. It   appears then, that there is the strongest analogy between
  the two immediate   precursors of the Hebrew’s deliverance, and circumstances among
  ourselves,   viz: their increase of population and their increased oppression; “and
  when   the time drew near” “the people grew and multiplied in Egypt. Acts VII, 17.   “For
  since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to this   people;
  neither hast thou delivered them at all.” Ex. V-23. I hope the   opposition will
  not be carried to the same extent as it was by the   Anti-abolitionists of Egypt,
  because I love my country. It is believed by many   thinking men that slavery cannot
  hold out thirty years longer in this country;   and that its extermination, or the
  dissolution of our union is near. If these   men are fanatics, is it not a little
  singular that they are so on this subject   only? </p> <p>   The reason which a
  “New-England man” and others love to assign why they cannot   co-operate with abolitionists
  is, that Mr. G. has uttered and published some   extravagant things. This objection
  is as unsatisfactory as it is disingenuous.   Many of the friends of the anti-slavery
  society have thought so too, and   regretted it. Be this as it may, they think it
  unfair for the fourth of July   orators to be constantly calling out those expressions,
  which they deem   exceptionable, and presenting them in a garbled manner, without
  their   qualifications, and in senses quite different from what was intended, and
  then   attempting to fix an odium on the society. No allowance is made for the   peculiar
  &amp; extraordinary situation in which Mr. G. has been, and still is   placed. He
  is the first man who has dared to publish a paper devoted to the   cause of the
  oppressed colored man of this country. He has been thrown into   prison; five thousand
  dollars offered for his apprehension&nbsp; by the   legislature of a state, and
  two thousand five hundred by an association of   <em>Gentlemen</em> in S. Carolina,
  denounced as the veriest fanatic that ever existed; and   doubtless has enlisted
  a combination of the worst passions against himself,   that ever occupied the human
  breast. No body doubts that Mr. G. has the most   numerous and virulent enemies
  of any other individual in this country. Add to   this that he has thrown his whole
  soul into the cause which he pleads, and who   that retains a vestige of candor
  will refuse to overlook the sally of an   unguarded expression, or make a man an
  offender for a word? If the objection   above-mentioned by sufficient to justify
  the refusal to co-operate, why, on   the same principle we may cling to Popery,
  and refuse to co-operate in the   Protestant cause. Nothing tried the friends of
  Luther more than his violent   and daring expressions. They were considered by both
  friends and foes as   injurious to the cause he advocated; yet it is a question
  not fully settled   whether a man less ardent and more prudent, would have succeeded
  quite as   well. He saw distinctly as did many others that his cause on the main
  was   right; and many now perceive, (their number fast increasing) that the   prominent
  features of the abolitionists are those of truth and justice, and   will most assuredly
  prevail.&nbsp;&nbsp; N.B. (author) </p> '
