transcription: "<p>  It is almost mathematically certain that the Colonization Society
  with its<br>  present sentiments and organization, can never effect the abolition
  of slavery<br>  in the United States. This Society was organized, January 14, 1817.
  During the<br>  seventeen years of its existence it has, (free blacks aside) transported
  on an<br>  average almost sixty a year who had been slaves, but which were not<br>
  \ emancipated by the society. The increase of our slave population is known to<br>
  \ be about 60 thousand a year, or about 170 a day. Should things continue in<br>
  \ this ratio, it may be seen, that while the society (bankruptcy of $40,000<br>
  \ aside) is transporting one emancipated black to Liberia, which it has done<br>
  \ nothing toward manumitting, more than a thousand have been added by births!<br>
  \ When a distinguished friend, therefore, of the society acknowledges that if<br>
  \ the society should remove the whole in a hundred years it is as soon as could<br>
  \ reasonably be expected, has he not fixed the period quite too soon? Would not<br>
  \ the end of time be quite a probable? Besides, who can doubt that from a<br>  population
  of 2,000,000 as many as that would have been manumnitted had no<br>  such society
  existed. And had the funds which have been expended for their<br>  outfit, transportation,
  and mal-administration of the colony, been<br>  appropriated to their education
  and comfortable settlement in this their<br>  native country, how much more honorable
  as well as righteous in those who have<br>  so long and sorely oppressed them!<br></p><p>
  \ A New-England citizen thinks he has presented the public with a good offset to<br>
  \ calculations like the above, by stating that Mr. G. (the American Wilberforce)<br>
  \ has been engaged for several years, and the Anti-Slavery society two years and<br>
  \ have emancipated one boy in Boston. And thinks the enquiry :When will the<br>
  \ society remove the entire population of our country?” will apply with more<br>
  \ force to the Anti-Slavery society, than that of the Colonization. And<br>  especially
  (he thinks) as when it is remembered that laws preventing<br>  emancipation and
  oppressing the colored people, have been passed in many<br>  states since the Liberator
  and other similar publications have been in<br>  circulation. But who does not see
  a wide difference in the prospective view of<br>  these societies, As the Colonization
  Society disavows any intention to<br>  interfere with the RIGHT of the slave holder,
  why, of course, he may dwell in<br>  peaceable fellowship with him forever, whether
  he is willing to release<br>  another slave or not. Now the Anti-slavery Society
  not only avows for its<br>  object the abolition of slavery entirely, but its object
  is to act on the<br>  entire population EN MASSE whose prerogative it is to remove
  oppressive laws,<br>  and to awaken and correct public sentiment on this subject,
  against which no<br>  system of wickedness can long hold out, whether legalised
  or not. The<br>  emancipation of the boy in Boston therefore, is but an incidental
  affair;<br>  while at the same time it is a test of the society’s sincerity and
  efficiency.<br>  Should the Colonization Society ever exceed the prescribed limits
  of their<br>  object, so as to turn their attention to an enslaved boy in Boston
  or<br>  elsewhere, it will doubtless refuse to incur the expense and trouble of
  a<br>  prosecution and wait patiently the pleasure of his holder to voluntarily<br>
  \ release him, which perhaps will be at the termination of the slave’s life.<br></p><p>
  \ While therefore, the above mentioned case is a test of the vigor of the<br>  society,
  it may also stand like the Egyptian which Moses slew and the Hebrew<br>  which he
  defended, prelusive of the final and complete deliverance of that<br>  unhappy and
  enslaved people. He supposed that his brethren would by his hand<br>  deliver them;
  “<br>  <em>but they understood it not.</em>  ” As to the oppressive laws enacted
  since the efforts of the friends of<br>  liberty, I should hardly have thought that
  a man with the views and feelings<br>  of a New-England man would have dared to
  utter them, as it cannot fail to call<br>  up to the mind of every reader the policy
  of Pharaoh and his counsellors. It<br>  appears then, that there is the strongest
  analogy between the two immediate<br>  precursors of the Hebrew’s deliverance, and
  circumstances among ourselves,<br>  viz: their increase of population and their
  increased oppression; “and when<br>  the time drew near” “the people grew and multiplied
  in Egypt. Acts VII, 17.<br>  “For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name,
  he hath done evil to this<br>  people; neither hast thou delivered them at all.”
  Ex. V-23. I hope the<br>  opposition will not be carried to the same extent as it
  was by the<br>  Anti-abolitionists of Egypt, because I love my country. It is believed
  by many<br>  thinking men that slavery cannot hold out thirty years longer in this
  country;<br>  and that its extermination, or the dissolution of our union is near.
  If these<br>  men are fanatics, is it not a little singular that they are so on
  this subject<br>  only?<br></p><p>  The reason which a “New-England man” and others
  love to assign why they cannot<br>  co-operate with abolitionists is, that Mr.G.
  has uttered and published some<br>  extravagant things. This objection is as unsatisfactory
  as it is disingenuous.<br>  Many of the friends of the anti-slavery society have
  thought so too, and<br>  regretted it. Be this as it may, they think it unfair for
  the fourth of July<br>  orators to be constantly calling out those expressions,
  which they deem<br>  exceptionable, and presenting them in a garbled manner, without
  their<br>  qualifications, and in senses quite different from what was intended,
  and then<br>  attempting to fix an odium on the society. No allowance is made for
  the<br>  peculiar &amp; extraordinary situation in which Mr. G. Has been, and still
  is<br>  placed. He is the first man who has dared to publish a paper devoted to
  the<br>  cause of the oppressed colored man of this country. He has been thrown
  into<br>  prison; five thousand dollars offered for his apprehension&nbsp; by the<br>
  \ legislature of a state, and two thousand five hundred by an association of<br>
  \ <em>Gentlemen</em>  in S. Carolina, denounced as the verist fanatic that ever
  existed; and<br>  doubtless has enlisted a combination of the worst passions against
  himself,<br>  that ever occupied the human breast. No body doubts that Mr. G. has
  the most<br>  numerous and virulent enemies of any other individual in this country.
  Add to<br>  this that he has thrown his whole soul into the cause which he pleads,
  and who<br>  that retains a vestige of candor will refuse to overlook the sally
  of an<br>  unguarded expression, or make a man an offender for a word? If the objection<br>
  \ above-mentioned by sufficient to justify the refusal to co-operate, why, on<br>
  \ the same principle we may cling to Popery, and refuse to co-operate in the<br>
  \ Protestant cause. Nothing tried the friends of Luther more than his violent<br>
  \ and daring expressions. They were considered by both friends and foes as<br>  injurious
  to the cause he advocated; yet it is a question not fully settled<br>  whether a
  man less ardent and more prudent, would have succeeded quite as<br>  well. He //
  saw distinctly as did many others that his cause on the main was<br>  right; and
  many now perceive, (their number fast increasing) that the<br>  prominent features
  of the abolitionists are those of truth and justice, and<br>  will most assuredly
  prevail.&nbsp;&nbsp; N.B. (author)<br></p>"
