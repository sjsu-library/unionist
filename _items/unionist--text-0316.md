transcription: "<p>Liberator.</p><p>THE SPIRIT OF SEVENTY-SIX</p><p>  The following
  extract we venture to make from a long epistle recently <br>  addressed to us, by
  the venerable GEORGE BENSON of Brooklyn, Connecticut, the <br>  present estimable
  President of the New-England Anti-Slavery Society. He is an <br>  abolitionist of
  the old school, and commenced at the earliest period with <br>  Clarkson and Wilberforce,
  for the suppression of the foreign slave trade. <br>  Although far advanced in years,
  he is in vigorous possession of his mental <br>  faculties; and his hand writing
  is firm and plain, to a marvel. <br></p><p>  “I observed in a late Boston paper,
  that the annual meeting of the Peace <br>  Society was to convene in that city.
  Several weeks since I addressed a letter <br>  to a friend in Hartford, who is actively
  engaged in the Pacific cause, and <br>  informed him that I considered the cause
  of Peace and the abolition of Slavery <br>  to be so inseparably connected, that
  wherever one society existed, the other <br>  should be located&nbsp; in its vicinity;
  and my opinion originates from the <br>  import of the sacred hymn, chanted by the
  angelic host at the advent of our <br>  blessed Saviour—‘Peace on earth and <br>
  \ <em>good will to men.</em>  ’ And how can we exercise this good will on a more
  important and urgent <br>  occasion, than to rescue our fellow men from the matchless
  and oppressive <br>  cruelties of slavery? <br></p><p>  It is universally admitted
  that the first Congress in the United States was <br>  composed of the most pure
  and enlightened citizens, who, on the 6<sup>th</sup>  of July, 1775, announced the
  following sentiments: <br></p><p>  ‘If it were possible for men, who exercise their
  reason, to believe that the <br>  Divine Author of our existence intended a part
  of the human race to hold an <br>  absolute property in, and unbounded power over
  others, marked out by infinite <br>  goodness and wisdom, as the objects of a legal
  domination never rightfully <br>  resistible, however, however severe and oppressive—the
  inhabitants of these <br>  Colonies might at least require from the Parliament of
  Great Britain, some <br>  evidence that this dreadful authority over them has been
  granted to that <br>  body.’ <br></p><p>  May not the poor slaves emphatically adopt
  the same inquiry of their lordly <br>  oppressors? <br></p><p>  Again, in 1779,
  a pamphlet appeared, published by order of Congress, which <br>  contains the following
  opinion: <br></p><p>  ‘The great principle (of government) I, that men are by nature
  free, as <br>  accountable to Him that made them, they must be so, and so long as
  we have any <br>  idea of Divine Justice, we must associate that of human freedom.’
  <br></p><p>  Now, it appears evident to me, that the above recited sentiments authorize
  and <br>  sanction an avowed opposition to slavery, and even censure those who think
  <br>  otherwise, as being destitute of any correct opinion of Divine Justice. <br></p>"

commentary: George Benson Sr. (1752-1836) was an ardent reformer, and a co-founder
  of the Windham County Peace Society. He and his large family formed an important
  source of support for Prudence Crandall. He became William Lloyd Garrison's father-in-law
  upon Garrison's marriage to Helen Benson.
