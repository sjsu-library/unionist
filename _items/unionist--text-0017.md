  of July address.</em></p><p>What, let us consider, was the specific object of our
  Fathers’ labors and their sacrifices? It was, that they might secure to their posterity,
  if not to themselves, the rights of man, the blessings of civil and religious liberty,
  the prerogative of self-government. Who, when he reflects that this was their object,
  and how steadily they kept it in view, can hesitate to accord to them a higher praise,
  than is due to the founders of any other nation? It was, let us repeat, the moral
  character of the American Revolution, which gave it its peculiar grandeur. Do you
  feel any veneration, any love for Washington and his com-patriots, merely on account
  of the bloody battles they fought? You ought not. You should recoil with horror
  from scenes of blood, let the actors in them have been who they may. The heroes
  of our Revolution, it is true, fought bravely, desperately. But this alone would
  be equivocal applause. It was the purity of their intentions, their self-devotion
  to the cause of Liberty, which makes them deservedly the pride of our country, and
  the honor of our race. The battles which they fought, the thousands of fellow-beings
  whom they slew, were incidents in the prosecution of their undertaking, which the
  benevolent can never think of, but with sorrow and loathing.</p><p>It is then, we
  say again, the great moral purpose of the Revolution, which commends it, and those
  who conducted it, to our most grateful remembrance. How ardent and unfeigned they
  were in their love of Liberty, is evident not more in what they did and suffered
  during the contest, than in the provisions they afterwards made for the protection
  of our rights.— Ere they had laid aside their arms, all fresh from the scenes of
  danger and of loss through which they had passed, our fathers instituted a form
  of government, which excluded themselves no less than it excluded others from all
  distinctions of honor or profit, but such as their fellow citizens might freely
  accord to them. The principles on which they based our civil fabric are broad and
  deep. Their recognition of these as the only just foundation of human governments,
  gives us the clearest evidence that they were men of high intellectual power, and
  of unparalleled integrity. They promulgated doctrines, the truth and value of which
  are not yet fully realized. Hereafter, their wisdom and foresight will be more justly,
  that is to say, more highly appreciated. — Certain momentous questions are now agitating
  our Republic, and others are soon coming up to trouble us, which might at once be
  settled by a candid appeal to the constitution which they bequeathed us. —If we
  guide our political and religious affairs by the plain principles therein propounded,
  we shall avert those evils, which now threaten our very existence as a united people.
  But if we disregard them, the most fearful consequences are inevitable.</p><p>Our
  fathers declared that all men are created equal, with a right to freedom — A declaration
  of infinite import! A glorious, gospel, heaven inspired truth! If we deeply feel
  and duly regard this, whose rights or feelings shall we violate? This is a truth
  which ought to be indelibly engraven on every heart. It should control all the measures
  of government, and the deportment of individuals towards each other. It is <em>the</em>
  truth, out of which arise those principles, that should guide the intercourse of
  man with man, and of one community with another, both in respect to their civil
  and their religious concerns. It is but a new version of our Saviour’s golden rule.</p><p>By
  the result of those measures, which were determined upon fifty-seven years ago,
  we have been called unto liberty. Let us seriously reflect upon the nature and extent
  of the blessing, that we may not use it for an occasion to the flesh, but in willing
  obedience to God and his Christ, whose service alone is perfect freedom.</p><p>Think
  not, brethren, that ye are free because your fathers threw of the yoke of colonial
  subjection. Think not that ye are free because ye have no king, nor hereditary nobility
  to reign over you. Think not that ye are free because ye live in a country where
  the supreme power is in the hands of the people. Such are indeed the highly favorable
  circumstances of your condition; and yet you may be in bondage, more abject than
  that from which our fathers were delivered. You may be in bondage to the majority,
  whose will, if the principles of our constitution be forgotten, may become as absolute
  and arbitrary as the will of any despot. You may be the creatures of your own party
  or sect, to whose opinions you may be compelled to assent, and in whose projects
  you may be obliged to toil, on pain of expulsion from their ranks, and the odium
  of an outcast. Or worse than all, you may be the slaves of some prevailing vice,
  or of some wicked or foolish custom.</p><p>It was obviously the intention of those
  who framed our constitution, to sustain every man in forming his own opinions on
  all subjects, and in acting in accordance with his own opinions, unless they would
  lead him to violate the equal rights of another. But there are indications every
  where, that this wise intention of our fathers has already come to be often disregarded.
  Unmindful of their high individual responsibility, the mass of our people, instead
  of examining and judging for themselves, seem willing that others should shape their
  opinions and guide their actions. Though they loudly boast of their freedom, they
  are the humble servants of “the few.” In consequence, they have become arrayed in
  parties and sects, the country over, with their general and subordinate leaders,
  and their organs of inter-communication. What their leaders declare to them, they
  believe too often, it is feared, without inquiry. Whithersoever their leaders go,
  they follow, nothing doubting. This is, we believe, too just an account of our religious
  and political affairs. It is rarely, very rarely, that we see an individual thinking
  and acting without an undue defence to some party. — How continually do we perceive
  in large bodies of men, a sameness of opinion and a unity of action, which there
  could not, would not be, if it were not for some <em>master</em> minds controlling
  them with absolute authority. Ye have witnessed the struggles of the rival factions
  in our land. Have ye thought their zeal has been according to knowledge? Have ye
  seen reason to believe that the individuals, on either side, thoroughly understood
  the merits of their cause? And that each one acted as his own best judgment and
  kind feelings dictated? Has it not rather been apparent to you that the individual
  merged himself in his party, feeling it safe for him to act in concert with numbers;
  and fearing, that if he should dare to stand alone, withholding himself from both
  sides, he might be considered trust-worthy by neither, and perhaps would incur some
  more distinct expression of their displeasure? Do we then exercise and enjoy, as
  we might and ought to do, that civil and religious liberty of which we are so boastful?</p><p>These
  are a few of many questions, which should be pressed upon the serious consideration
  of every one. Our limits forbid us to mention several others, which have been suggested
  to our minds by the return of this season. We wish to see the anniversary of our
  independence devoted to higher purposes, than it has usually been. There has been
  enough, and more than enough of self-gratulation. We have taken too much credit
  to ourselves for the deeds of our fathers. Let us do them and ourselves a higher
  honor. Let us emulate their excellences and shun their errors.—Indeed let us not
  be satisfied until we surpass them in knowledge and in virtue; as the superior advantages
  they procured for us should enable us to do. Let us make a wider and a higher application,
  than they did, of the great principles for which they so nobly contended. Let us
  not rest satisfied with our liberty, while aught of slavery abides in our land.</p>

commentary: While no author is given, this might well be Samuel J. May's contribution.
  It embraces peace principles, anti-slavery, and equality before the law.
