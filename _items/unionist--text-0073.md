transcription: "<p>  “Our friend of the Providence Patriot is mistaken in attributing
  to us, the<br>  writings of “Inistail.” The credit of those writings, whatever it
  may be,<br>  belongs to another person, though it is, (to adopt the language of
  our<br>  neighbor up stairs) “all in the family.” –<br>  <em>Brooklyn (Ct.) Unionist.”</em></p><p>
  \ “”All in the family,:” is it? Then, to use the language of an Irishman who was<br>
  \ once led into a similar error, we can only say to Mr. Burleigh,—“faith, sir,<br>
  \ and we thought you were your<br>  <em>brother!””</em></p>"
scholarlyNotes: Since there was no "Inistail" in 1.2, that means it is either in 1.1
  or 1.3, with this response being 1.4
commentary: Apparently an editorial, in one of the missing issues of <em>The Unionist</em>,
  by one of Charles Burleigh's brothers. The most likely candidate, of course, is
  William Burleigh, but even the eldest son, John Burleigh, could be possible.
