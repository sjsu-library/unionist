transcription: "“Miss Crandall and her sister, were on Saturday last brought before
  Justice Adams, charged with the old offence of teaching ‘the base born Africans,
  unmindful of the high behest which says , ‘let there be darkness.’” They were found
  guilty, and required to procure bonds for their appearance at the County Court now
  in session. No one appearing immediately to give the required bonds, the Court was
  adjourned until Monday, that they might have time to procure them.” – Brooklyn Unionist "
