transcription: "“Miss Crandall and her sister, were on Saturday last brought before
  Justice<br>Adams, charged with the old offence of teaching ‘the base born Africans,<br>unmindful
  of the high behest which says , ‘let there be darkness.’” They were<br>found guilty,
  and required to procure bonds for their appearance at the County<br>Court now in
  session. No one appearing immediately to give the required bonds,<br>the Court was
  adjourned until Monday, that they might have time to procure<br>them.” – Brooklyn
  Unionist<br>"
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: The fact that this event was so widely republished shows the strong national
  interest in the Canterbury Female Academy.
