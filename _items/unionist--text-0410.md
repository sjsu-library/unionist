transcription: The Anti-Slavery cause seems to be gaining ground in the region adjacent
  to Canterbury. A correspondent of the “Unionist” gives an account of an interesting
  Anti-Slavery meeting, at Abington in Pomfret, at which Rev. S.J. May of Brooklyn
  addressed the audience.
scholarlyNotes: This could be 1:12 or 1:13 issue of The Unionist
commentary: Pomfret was where the Goodell family resided, so it is likely that William
  Goodell knew some of the participants here.
