transcription: 'There are those to whom a sense of religion has come in storm and
  tempest: there<br>are those whom it has summoned amid scenes of revelry and idle
  vanity: there are<br>those, too, who have heard its ‘still small voice’ amid rural
  leisure and placid<br>contentment; but perhaps the knowledge which causeth not to
  err, is most<br>frequently impressed upon the mind during seasons of affliction;
  and tears are<br>the softened showers which cause the seed of heaven to spring and
  take root in<br>the human breast.—<br><em>Walter Scott</em>'
