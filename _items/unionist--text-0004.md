transcription: "<p>THE CANTERBURY AFFAIR. – Some of the people of Canterbury are still
  exasperated about the school for colored misses, recently established by Miss Crandall.
  But very few of the 30 or 40 scholars who were expected to commence with the term,
  have as yet attended — owing, probably, to the “fanaticism” which seems to have
  taken hold on the minds of so many of the sober citizens of that portion of the
  “land of steady habits;” and which vents itself in vexatious attempts at legally
  coercing the scholars to leave the town, and the teacher to abandon the enterprise.
  We have been favored by a correspondent, with the following copy of a proceeding
  of a town-meeting on the subject, which we publish “for the benefit of whom it may
  concern”</p><p>“At a town meeting legally warned and held at Canterbury on the 1st
  day of April, 1833, Asahel Bacon Esq. Moderator—</p><p>Voted, that a petition of
  the town of Canterbury, to the next general assembly, be drawn up in suitable language,
  deprecating the evil consequences of bringing from other towns, and other states,
  people of color, for any purpose, and more especially for the purposes of disseminating
  the principles and doctrines opposed to the benevolent colonization system, praying
  said assembly to pass and enact such laws, as in their wisdom will prevent the evil;
  and that Andrew P. Judson, William Lester, Chester Lyon, Rufus Adams, Solomon Payne,
  Andrew T. Harris, Asahel Bacon, George S. White, Daniel Packer and Isaac Backus,
  be agents to do the same.</p><p>Voted, that said agents respectfully request the
  inhabitants of other towns to proffer similar petitions, for the same laudable object.</p><p>The
  foregoing is a true copy of Record:</p><p>Examined by</p><p>Andrew Judson <em>Town
  Clerk</em></p><p>Fine business, truly!—<em>Perhaps</em> those who have been so much
  in the habit of reading homilies on constitutional law, to the “hair-brained emancipationists,”
  might be instructed with a peep into that instrument which binds our states together,
  and there read for themselves, the rights of citizens going from one state to another—<em>“for
  any purpose,”</em>—or in its favor,—so that they conduct morally and peaceably.
  But what are the “evil consequences” which are so much to be <em>“deprecated,”</em>
  in the petitions to the legislature of that state? And how can a “petition” be “drawn
  up in <em>suitable language,”</em> which “deprecates the evil consequences of bringing”
  people of color into that town, <em>“for any purpose”</em>—whether to gain moral
  or literary instruction, cultivate land, vend merchandize, or “make notions”? Garrison
  is completely “out Garrisoned,” in “fanaticism” and “incendiary” movements,—by a
  body which <em>ought</em> to have been deliberative! But we do not believe a majority
  of the citizens of Canterbury favor such “wild schemes,” even though backed by the
  declaration of a professing Christian, “that before he would see the Green polluted
  by a negro school, he would oppose it to the shedding of blood!”"
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: This editorial, published two months prior to <em>The Unionist</em> even
  being hatched, is what alerted Samuel J. May to Charles C. Burleigh and his powerful
  editorial voice. It is included here as an important part of the pre-history of
  <em>The Unionist</em>, as well as being an outstanding example of Charles C. Burleigh's
  writing style at this point in his career. <em>The Genius of Temperance</em>, edited
  by William Goodall, was a mainstay of support to the Canterbury Female Academy.
  Goodall's long career in reform included a significant level of support for women's
  rights.
