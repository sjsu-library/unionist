transcription: "“MYSTERIOUS AFFAIR. We learn from the Brooklyn Unionist, that on Tuesday
  afternoon, 27th ult. about 2 o’clock, the house of Miss CRANDALL, the instructress
  of colored youths in Canterbury, was discovered to be <em>on fire</em>, in a place
  and under circumstances which rendered the origin of it inexplicable. The flame
  and smoke burst out from the corner of one of the rooms farthest from the chimney
  and fire place, but the inmates of the house with the assistance of the neighboring
  villagers succeeded in putting it out. This would readily be supposed to be accidental,
  had not public threats been previously made to <em>effectually break up Miss C’s
  school.</em> If, as is suspected, it shall prove to be the work of any of those
  opposed to the efforts of this young lady—they may take back the ignoble epithet
  of <em>‘incendiary’</em> with which they have frequently hailed the abolitionists,
  and wear it like Cain, branded on their foreheads.— <em>N. Bedford Workingmen’s
  Press.</em> ” "
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: This account - from the <em>New Bedford Workingmen's Press</em> via <em>The
  Liberator</em> - is best described as a close paraphrase of the material that was
  published in <em>The Unionist</em>
