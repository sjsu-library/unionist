transcription: "“MYSTERIOUS AFFAIR. We learn from the Brooklyn Unionist, that on Tuesday
  <br>afternoon, 27th ult. about 2 o’clock, the house of Miss CRANDALL, the <br>instructress
  of colored youths in Canterbury, was discovered to be&nbsp; <br><em>on fire</em>,
  in a place and under circumstances which rendered the origin of it <br>inexplicable.
  The flame and smoke burst out from the corner of one of the rooms <br>farthest from
  the chimney and fire place, but the inmates of the house with the <br>assistance
  of&nbsp; the neighboring villagers succeeded in putting it out. This <br>would readily
  be supposed to be accidental, had not public threats been <br>previously made to&nbsp;
  <br><em>effectually break up Miss C’s school.</em>&nbsp;If, as is suspected, it
  shall prove to be the work of any of those opposed <br>to the&nbsp; efforts of this
  young lady—they may take back the ignoble epithet <br>of&nbsp; <br><em>‘incendiary’</em>&nbsp;with
  which they have frequently hailed the abolitionists, and wear it like <br>Cain,
  branded on their foreheads.— <br><em>N. Bedford Workingmen’s Press.</em>” <br>"

commentary: This account - from the <em>New Bedford Workingmen's Press</em> via <em>The
  Liberator</em> - is best described as a close paraphrase of the material that was
  published in <em>The Unionist</em>
