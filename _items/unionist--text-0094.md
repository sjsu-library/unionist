transcription: <p align="right">FOR THE UNIONIST.</p><p>  “Philosophy, though eagle-eyed
  in nature’s tendencies” has not succeeded in<br>  drawing a line of discrimination
  between the members of the human family, so<br>  marked as to proscribe from the
  commonwealth of humanity those who Cowper says<br>  are “guilty of a skin not colored
  like his own.” Indeed if my complexion does<br>  afford proof that I am not so nobly
  born, not endowed with the same<br>  unalienable privileges and rights as those
  of a different color, I declare<br>  that I am not ambitious of attaining their
  prerogatives, by changing skins<br>  with any of them—and much less do I repine
  at the decrees of Him who has made<br>  of one blood all the nations of the earth.<br></p><p>  Though
  in the New-England States color is not deemed a sufficient offence to<br>  consign
  the limbs of the tawny inhabitant to the shackle, and his back to the<br>  scourge,
  yet the prejudices of the South are not wholly unfelt in the North;<br>  although
  the fetter falls from the limb of the African, when his foot touches<br>  the New
  England soil, still there lingers about the heart of a yankee some of<br>  that
  bitterness and contempt towards his colored brethren, which forged<br>  galling
  chains for that oppressed race.<br></p><p>  Many specious arguments have been advanced
  to prove the justness of African<br>  Slavery, and although many honest men have
  met and refuted them, others have<br>  allowed themselves to be wheedled into the
  comfortable idea, that they are<br>  made of better clay, and entitled to more consideration,
  than their degraded<br>  sufferers. Let me call upon<br>  <em>you</em>  , who have
  still a small proportion of humanity left in your bosoms, to start<br>  from the
  siren flaterers, who would lull you to repose, while thousand of your<br>  fellow
  creatures groan beneath the lash of unfeeling tyrants, under the flag<br>  of a
  nation professing to be guided by the law of Liberty, and Equal Rights!<br>  Have
  you not professed to the world, that “ALL MEN ARE BORN FREE AND EQUAL.”<br>  Is
  not this mockery? Are not these very letters shaded by the crimson blood of<br>  your
  suffering brethren? Or<br>  <em>are not</em>  Africans men? Tyrant, does not your
  bleeding slave while kneeling to you for<br>  mercy, address you in the language
  of human nature—and do not<br>  <em>you</em>  prove yourself incapable of appreciating
  that language? ‘Tis<br>  <em>you</em>  who seem less than a man, and most devoid
  of every principle, every attribute<br>  of humanity.<br></p><p>  One miserable
  refuge, behind which the slave-holder retreats, is this; that<br>  many slaves are
  very well satisfied with their situation and would not wish to<br>  change it!”
  Very fine indeed! Because you have reduced them to this abject<br>  dependence,
  and perverted all the noble independence of their nature, you have<br>  a right
  to trample upon their undeniable rights, and continue the iniquitous<br>  business!
  Because a blind man loves the taste of arsenic, (being ignorant of<br>  its deadly
  tendency) you will thrust it down his throat! From what must that<br>  contentedness
  arise, which induces the slave to embrace the scourge and hub<br>  the fetter. Would<br>  <em>you</em>  be
  content to drudge for a master, and crouch at his feet like a dog? You say<br>  “death
  before slavery,” and you would despise a white man who would submit to<br>  the
  degradation of unlimited subordination. Because a wretch who is weary of<br>  life
  requests you to shoot him, would you be justified in blowing his brains<br>  out
  with a pistol? Answer these questions ye advocates for slavery, and if<br>  “custom
  has not steeled your hearts” to every principle of rectitude, you will<br>  see
  that mercy to a negro entitles you to no praise, since he has the same<br>  claim
  to liberty and respect as a European.<br></p><p align="right">CATO.</p>
scholarlyNotes: Black male writer
commentary: This letter stands as perhaps the most important<br>indication of the
  local Black male presence in <em>The Unionist</em>. As was the case in the trial
  transcripts, a Black history lesson is embedded in the frequent use of "Cato" as
  a pen name. During the time of the American Revolution, the white founding fathers
  specifically wanted to shape the new government like that of the Roman Republic,
  not the Roman Empire. Hence they preferred the mythos of Cato - exemplifying moral
  courage and integrity - to that of Caesar's power grab. African-Americans, of course,
  found the white emphasis on liberty both puzzling - given the continued presence
  of slavery - and an opportunity to use this now-public rhetoric. Thus, as you can
  see in the illustration accompanying this entry, one of the most famous African-American
  petitions of the Revolutionary era came from "Cato" - a poor Black whose emancipation
  was in danger from an attempt to repeal a law granting liberty. Written in 1781,
  Cato's petition was well-known in the Black community.
