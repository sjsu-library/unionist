caption: Frederick Douglass's "What to the Slave is the Fourth of July" (1852) is
  justly his most famous speech. It was, though, not an isolated instance, but the
  pinnacle of a long Abolitionist tradition, in both Black and white communities,
  of pointing out the gap between celebrating American freedom while slavery still
  existed.
