transcription: " <p>“FOR THE REGISTER”</p> <p>“THE UNIONIST” </p> <p>“A Distinguished
  gentleman from Windham County, recently in this city, informs that the Unionist,
  printed at Brooklyn, is distributed gratis throughout the country. Arthur Tappan,
  a few days before issuing the first number, went to Brooklyn, and conferred with
  the Rev. Mr. May, the Unitarian clergyman there—both proceeded to Canterbury, on
  a visit to Miss Crandall, and returned to Brooklyn; the printing house was set in
  order, and the new paper appeared.</p> <p>It seems this paper is a joint effort
  of Abolitionism and Anti-Masonry, Unitarianism and Temperance—a rare <em>union</em>
  of valuable elements.</p> <p>Will the Congregational Clergy and the ultra orthodox
  range themselves with Arthur Tappan and his heretical compeer? We shall see.</p>
  <p>The Litchfield Enquirer is endeavoring to raise an excitement on the subject
  of the Canterbury law, thinking perhaps, that if the question were put to the inhabitants
  of Litchfield, whether they would consent to the establishment of a negro school
  among them, in addition to their present schools, they would answer in the affirmative.
  But in this he may be mistaken.</p> <p>The shouting horn of federal sedition this
  year, is to be the Canterbury negro school, and the dissection law.</p> <p>ANDOVER</p>"
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: Note here the attempt to paint Unitarianism as suspect, and to indicate
  that Tappan's alliance with Samuel J. May is likewise suspicious – conversely it
  points to the wide range of religious tolerance and coexistence in the ranks of
  the Abolitionists. <em>The Columbian Register</em>, based in New Haven, had been
  a leading voice of opposition to the proposed Manual Labor College for Black men
  in 1831.
