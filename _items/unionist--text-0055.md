    The war in Portugal, the only remnant of war which now remains among civilized
    nations, was getting to look more favorable for Pedro.

    LONDON, June 14
    <sup>th</sup>
    .—In the House of Commons last night, Mr C. Grant, in a speech of great
    length, laid before the House, the propositions of Government for regulating
    the affairs of the East India Company, to the effect that the trade to China
    should be thrown open; and that it is expedience the Government of India
    should remain in the hands of the Company subject to regulations to be
    prescribed by Parliament.
  </p>
  <p>
    LONDON, June 12.—The House last night resolved itself into a Committee on
    Colonial Slavery, when the resolution empowering Ministers to grant 20,000,000
    <em>l.</em>
    as compensation to the West India Planters came under consideration.
  </p>
  <p>The resolution was adopted 286 to 77.</p>
  <p>

    OFORTO, June 4.—On Saturday night and Sunday morning, the 1
    <sup>st</sup>
    and 2d inst. the first division of the much talked of squadron of steamers
    arrived off the bar, with reinforcements of troops, money, provisions and
    stores. This seasonable addition to the forces previously collected here has
    infused fresh vigor into the Constitutional party. Among the passengers
    brought by these four steamers were the Duke of Fayal (better known by nis
    former title of Marquis de Palmella,) Captain Napier, R.N. (the successor of
    Admiral Sartorius,) and others.

    The Pedroite batteries have completely silenced the Gaya by well directed shot
    and shells, exploding in its embrasures, and blowing into the air, gun
    carriages, bodies, &amp;c., till the soldiers have actually refused doing duty
    in this slaughterhouse, as they call it, from whence they are said to remove
    the long guns.
  </p>
  <p>
    Admiral Sartorius retires from the service on account of ill health, and
    Captain Napier is to assume the command of the fleet. The latter is
    represented to be a very smart and efficient officer.

  <p><em>Extract of a letter from Constantinople, dated May 22</em></p>
  <p>
    ‘We are very glad to observe that Government is sending reinforcements into
    the Mediterranean. It is high time they take some steps, or they will be too
    late. Russia has got the start of England and France, and notwithstanding the
    continued assurances given us that peace is made with Egypt, yet Russia
    continues pouring troops in here as fast as her means of transport from Odessa
    will permit; fresh troops are daily arriving. They are not, however, landed on
    the Bosphorus, but a few miles to the eastward of the entrance. By this means
    they mask their numbers. One or two of the castles at the entrance have been
    given up to them, and they are strengthening themselves as fast as they can;
    they have also a number of engineers and men working at the Dardanelles. What
    all this may end in we cannot say; appearances are any thing but favorable for
    a continuation of peace. The Ottoman Government, we fear, must fall.”

  <p>
    FRANCE AND THE UNITED STATES.—On the 11
    <sup>th</sup>
    of June the Chamber of Deputies received a communication from the Ministers of
    Finance, who offered a bill opening a credit for above five millions of
    francs, for the payment of the first fifth part of the 25 millions owing the
    United States, according to treaty.

  <p>
    CONSTANTINOPLE, May 28.—(By Express.) Ibrahim Pacha has really commenced his
    retreat, and preparations are making in the Russian camp, which indicate the
    speedy withdrawal of the troops.

    ENGLAND.—Mr Elliot Cresson
    <em>has declined</em>
    the challenge of Mr. Garrison to a public discussion in London on the merits
    of the American Colonization society.
  </p>
  <p>
    The advices from Warsaw state that the feeling against the Russians was daily
    becoming more violent. Several Russian officers had been killed in the
    streets, and Gen Paskewitsch himself narrowly escaped. Another revolt was
    contemplated.
  </p>
  <p>
    Port Lamar or Cobija, in Bolivia, has been declared a free port. Vessels are
    permitted to anchor and remain during pleasure, without charge of any kind.
    Goods which are landed have to pay a duty of five per cent. and some other
    small rates on being carried to the interior.

commentary: "A few items of interest here. There seems to be a mild pacifism throughout
  these selections, as well as notices of West Indian abolition, and William Lloyd
  Garrison being in London. \n"
