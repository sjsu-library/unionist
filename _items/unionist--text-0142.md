transcription: "<p>  “In the Brooklyn Unionist, Oct. 10<sup>th</sup>  , we find an
  account of a second trial of Miss Crandall before the Superior <br>  Court of Connecticut,
  Judge Daggett on the bench. The charge on which she was <br>  tried was for teaching
  colored people from other states. The Judge instructed <br>  the jury that free
  people of color are not citizens, and that the law of <br>  Connecticut is, therefore,
  not unconstitutional. The jury went out and after <br>  an absence of 20 or 30 minutes,
  returned with a verdict of guilty. A bill of <br>  exceptions was filed and the
  case put over to the Supreme Court of Errors, to <br>  be holden at Brooklyn next
  July. <br></p><p>  On this singular decision we remark that if the case be so that
  free colored <br>  people are not citizens of the United States, their condition
  is far worse <br>  than we had supposed. But we canot believe this, the arguments
  in the decision <br>  notwithstanding; and we cannot account for it that such a
  decision comes from <br>  Judge Daggett, except on the supposition that strong feeling,
  excited in his <br>  native place (New Haven), by an attempt to erect a similar
  school there some <br>  time ago, has biased his judgment. <br></p><p>Judge Daggett
  says</p><p>  ‘Are the colored inhabitants of this country citizens? It is the opinion
  of <br>  this court that they are not. Are slaves citizens of the U.S.? The <br>
  \ constitution recognizes them only as the basis of representation and taxation.
  <br>  I refer to the definition of the word citizen as given by Mr. Webster, the
  <br>  ablest philologist of this or any country. (The judge here read the several
  <br>  definitions of the word as given in Webster’s dictionary, the last of which,
  <br>  and the only one applicable to the case is as follows—“In the United States,
  a <br>  person, native or naturalized, who has the privilege of exercising the <br>
  \ elective franchise, and of purchasing and holding real estate.”) Slaves, then,
  <br>  are not citizens, in any of the state constitutions. Are Indians citizens?
  It <br>  is difficult to say what they are, but they are not citizens. Kent, in
  his <br>  commentaries, speaks of them as distinct tribes, living under the protection
  <br>  of the government,—2 Kent, 70. Are the free people of color citizens? I <br>
  \ answer, No. They are not so styled in the Constitution of the United States, <br>
  \ or, so far as I am aware, in the laws of Congress or of any of the states. In
  <br>  that clause of the constitution which fixes the basis of representation, there
  <br>  was an opportunity to have called them citizens if they were so considered.
  <br>  But that makes free <br>  <em>persons</em>  (adding three fifths of all other
  persons,) the basis of representation and <br>  taxation.” <br></p><p>  “They” (the
  free people of color) are not so styled (citizens) in the <br>  constitution of
  the United States.” What then? is it not implied? The <br>  constitution does not
  so style free <br>  <em>white</em>  persons, but does it not imply as much? Again,
  “I that clause which fixes the <br>  basis of representation, there was an opportunity
  to have called them citizens <br>  if they were so considered.” And so there was
  an opportunity to have called <br>  free white people citizens. If the omission
  excludes the one from citizenship, <br>  why not the other “But that (the constitution)
  makes free <br>  <em>persons</em>  (adding three fifths of all other persons) the
  basis of representation and <br>  taxation.” Now it seems to us that only two classes
  are here spoken of; first, <br>  free persons, who, absolutely, form a basis, and
  next, slaves, only three <br>  fifths of which form a basis. If then, the characteristic
  of forming a basis <br>  for representation and taxation, entire, without division
  (five fifths of a <br>  man and not three fifths) constitutes citizenship, by what
  logic is it <br>  inferred that <br>  <em>free</em>  colored persons are not citizens?
  The constitution it is true says nothing <br>  about complexion, but does the omission
  therefore exclude free colored persons <br>  If so can any one tell why it does
  not exclude free white persons? <br></p><p>  Judge Daggett says, “another reason
  for believing that people of color were <br>  not considered citizens is found in
  the fact&nbsp; that when the United States <br>  constitution was adopted, every
  state except Massachusetts, tolerated <br>  slavery.” We are dull—we do not see
  how this related to the point in question. <br></p><p>  It was argued in the Court,
  that free blacks own vessels which participate in <br>  the peculiar privileges
  of American shipping, and that blacks may sue in the <br>  United States courts.
  This was overruled on the ground that those points had <br>  never been settled
  by judicial decisions. We suppose it is true that free <br>  colored people have
  owned vessels, and participated in the peculiar privileges <br>  of American shipping
  ever since the constitution was formed, that they have <br>  also had suits in the
  U.S. Courts, and that they have received protections as <br>  American Citizens
  from British impressment. And it seems incredible that this <br>  should have gone
  of 57 years, unquestioned, if they were not in reality <br>  American citizens.
  <br></p><p>  What aid the definition of Webster gives to the decision we do not
  see. “In <br>  the United States (a citizen is) a person, native or naturalized,
  who has the <br>  privilege of exercising the elective franchise, and of purchasing
  and holding <br>  real estate.” Now in seven states the persons in question have
  the right of <br>  the elective franchise, and in all the right of purchasing and
  holding <br>  realestate. Does not the definition then make against the decision
  rather than <br>  for it? <br></p><p>  In this decision also Judge Daggett has gone
  in the face of very high opinion. <br>  In the Convention of New York for amending
  the constitution, on the motion to <br>  insert the wiord <br>  <em>white</em>  before
  the words “ <br>  <em>male citizens,”</em>  in the article relating to the right
  of suffrage, Peter A. Jay said, “Is not <br>  the right of suffrage a privilege?
  Can you deny it to a <br>  <em>citizen</em>  of Pennsylvania, who comes here and
  complies with your laws, merely because he <br>  is not six feet high, or because
  he is of a dark complexion?’ Chancellor Kent <br>  said <br></p><p>  “Suppose a
  <br>  <em>negro</em>  owning a freehold, and entitled to vote in Vermont, removes
  to this state, can <br>  we constitutionally exclude him from the privilege of voting?
  The constitution <br>  of the United States provides that <br>  <em>citizens</em>
  \ of each State shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of <br>  citizens
  of the several States.” <br></p><p>Rufus King said</p><p>  ‘Take the fact that a
  <br>  <em>citizen of color</em>  entitled to all the privileges of a citizen, comes
  here—he purchases a <br>  freehold—can you deny him the rights of an elector incident
  to his freehold? <br>  He is entitled to vote because like <br>  <em>any other citizen</em>
  \ he is a freeholder, and ever freeholder your laws entitle to vote.’ <br></p><p>And
  again,</p><p>  “ <br>  <em>    As certainly as the children of any white men are
  citizen, so certainly the <br>    children of black men are citizens.” <br>  </em></p><p>Abram
  Van Vechten said,</p><p>  ‘There is another and to my mind an insuperable objection
  to the exclusion of <br>  free citizens of color from the right of suffrage, arising
  from the provision <br>  of the Constitution of the U.S. that the citizens of each
  State shall be <br>  entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens in
  the several <br>  States.’ <br></p><p>  In 1826 De Witt Clinton demanded of President
  Adams the release of ‘Gilbert <br>  Horton a free man of color and a citizen of
  this state’ (New York) unlawfully <br>  imprisoned in the District of Columbia,
  on the ground that he was ‘a free man <br>  and a citizen.’ <br></p><p>  We cannot
  believe with Judge Daggett that the whole free colored population <br>  of our country
  is outlawed, that emancipation confers as privilege but that of <br>  rambling about.
  And we hope there is a higher appeal yet than the Supreme <br>  Court of blinded
  Connecticut before which this case may be tried. We believe <br>  the people of
  Canterbury and their abettors are heaping up for themselves a <br>  load of odium,
  which they will find it difficult to bear.” <br></p>"
