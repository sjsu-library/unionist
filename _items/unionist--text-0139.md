transcription: '<p>   WHEREAS, attempts have been made to establish literary institutions
  in this   State for the instruction of colored persons belonging to other states
  and   countries, which would tend to the great increase of the colored population
  of   the State, and thereby to the injury of the people: Therefore, </p> <p>   Sec.
  1. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives, in General   Assembly
  convened, That no person shall set up or establish in this State any   school, academy,
  or literary institution, for the instruction or education of   colored persons who
  are not inhabitants of this state, nor instruct or teach   in any school, academy,
  or other literary institution whatsoever in this   State, or harbor or board, for
  the purpose of attending or being taught or   instructed in any such school, academy,
  or literary institution, any colored   person who is not an inhabitant of any town
  in this state, without the   consent, in writing, first obtained of a majority of
  the civil authority, and   also of the selectmen of the town in which such school,
  academy, or literary   institution is situated; and each and every person who shall
  knowingly do any   act forbidden as aforesaid, or shall be aiding or assisting therein,
  shall,   for the first offence, forfeit and pay to the treasurer of state, a fine
  of   one hundred dollars, and for the second offence shall forfeit and pay a fine   of
  two hundred dollars, and so double for every offence of which he or she   shall
  be convicted. And all informing officers are required to make due   presentment
  of all breaches of this act.   <em>Provided</em>   , That nothing in this act shall
  extend to any district school established in   any school society, under the laws
  of this state, or to any school established   by any school society under the laws
  of this state, or to any incorporated   academy or incorporated school for instruction
  in this state. </p> <p>   Sec. 2.   <em>Be it further enacted</em>   , That any
  colored person, not an inhabitant of this state, who shall reside   in any town
  therein for the purpose of being instructed as aforesaid, may be   removed in the
  manner prescribed in the sixth and seventh sections of the act   to which this is
  an addition. </p> <p>   Sec. 3.   <em>Be it further enacted,</em>   That any person,
  not an inhabitant of this state, who shall reside in any town   therein, for the
  purpose of being instructed as aforesaid, shall be an   admissible witness in all
  prosecutions under the first section of this act,   and may be compelled to give
  testimony therein, notwithstanding any thing   contained in this act, or the act
  last aforesaid. </p> <p>   Sec. 4.   <em>Be it further enacts,</em>   That so much
  of the seventh section of the act to which this is an addition,   as may provide
  for the infliction of corporeal punishment, be, and the same is   hereby repealed.

scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: 'In reading the text of the actual Black Law carefully, one can observe
  that Judson and his allies substituted psychological coercion (sec. 3) for corporeal
  punishment (sec. 4). They did this knowing that any young free Black person would
  be under intense pressure to obey legal authority. While it was a standard practice
  for newspapers to republish legislative acts, what Charles Burleigh did here was
  place the Black Law, by which Crandall and the Canterbury Female Academy were being
  prosecuted, in the midst of the ''normal'' legislative activities. '
