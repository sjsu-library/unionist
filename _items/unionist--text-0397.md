transcription: <p align="center">THE RIOTS IN NEW-YORK,</p><p align="center">  <em>    Gotten
  up by the ‘Courier and Enquirer,’ and the ‘Commercial Advertiser.’<br>  </em></p><p>  &nbsp;
  &nbsp;In another column we have given some account of the outrage<br>  committed
  in New York by the partizans [sic] of the&nbsp; Colonization<br>  Society,* and
  the opposers of abolition. We feel the deepest shame that such<br>  violations of
  the public peace, and of the rights of citizens, should be&nbsp;<br>  perpetrated
  in our country, in this age of the world. But as they have<br>  transpired, we are
  bound to publish them—and to attribute&nbsp; these wicked<br>  works to their real
  authors. Who are they? Who are the incendiaries? Not<br>  surely the combustible
  materials which have been inflamed; but those<br>  unprincipled men who have inflamed
  them. Not the mob—but the men who have<br>  gathered, excited, and directed the
  mob. We say without hesitation, that James<br>  Watson Webb and Col. Stone should
  be held pre-eminently responsible for the<br>  late notorious proceedings in the
  city of New York. Their papers, ‘the Courier<br>  and Enquirer,’ and the ‘Commercial
  Advertiser,’ have been, for more than a<br>  year past, industriously circulating
  (through a larger portion of the<br>  community, than any other paper could,) the
  grossest misrepresentations of the<br>  sentiments and purposes of the Abolitionists.
  They have done all in their<br>  power to awaken the hatred, and&nbsp; direct the
  blind zeal of the ignorant,<br>  reckless, and unprincipled against a portion of
  their fellow citizens, whose<br>  only offence is, that they are pleading the cause
  of bleeding humanity—ay, the<br>  cause of millions of Americans, who are held in
  abject bondage, or paralyzing<br>  degradation. Paragraphs have repeatedly appeared
  in their papers, which more<br>  than intimated that any measures should be resorted
  to, for the suppression of<br>  the Abolitionists. It was owing to the exertions
  of the ‘Courier and Enquirer’<br>  and the ‘Commercial Advertiser,’ that the disgraceful
  proceedings took place<br>  there last fall, intended to prevent the formation of
  the New-York<br>  Anti-Slavery Society. And we may fairly attribute to them, more
  perhaps than<br>  to any other agents of the pro slavery party, the succession of
  riots that<br>  have recently occurred. —The style, in which Messrs. Webb and Stone
  have<br>  remarked upon these transactions, (more than half excusing) is&nbsp; adapted,<br>  if
  it be not designed, to urge on the populace to further outrage.<br></p><p>  &nbsp;
  &nbsp;Now we would ask the intelligent and candid, what does this<br>  procedure
  of the pro slavery party prove? What, but that they are conscious<br>  they cannot
  meet the opposers of American oppression and cruelty, in fair<br>  discussion!—If
  they could disprove our statements, refute our arguments, or<br>  turn the point
  of our appeal, are they indeed such men, that they would still,<br>  of choice,
  resort to the base means they have been using? We are unwilling to<br>  think they
  are so bad. Is it not rather because they foresee that moral means<br>  can never
  effect their purposes, that they resort to brute force?&nbsp; We<br>  think so.
  Let the intelligent and candid judge.—<br>  <em>Brooklyn Unionist.</em></p><p align="center"></p>

commentary: 'The riots in New York City directly affected many of the students at
  the Canterbury Female Academy. Black churches, Black businesses, and white abolitionists
  were attacked viciously. Numerous ebndorsers of the Canterbury Female Academy were
  singled out, most notably Peter Williams Jr. and Arthur Tappan. For an interesting
  discovery about these riots, see https://blog.mcny.org/2012/04/03/the-abolitionist-riots-of-1834/ '
