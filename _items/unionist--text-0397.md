  <p align="center">THE RIOTS IN NEW-YORK,</p>
  <p align="center">
    <em>
      Gotten up by the ‘Courier and Enquirer,’ and the ‘Commercial Advertiser.’
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp;In another column we have given some account of the outrage
    committed in New York by the partizans [sic] of the&nbsp; Colonization
    Society,* and the opposers of abolition. We feel the deepest shame that such
    violations of the public peace, and of the rights of citizens, should be&nbsp;
    perpetrated in our country, in this age of the world. But as they have
    transpired, we are bound to publish them—and to attribute&nbsp; these wicked
    works to their real authors. Who are they? Who are the incendiaries? Not
    surely the combustible materials which have been inflamed; but those
    unprincipled men who have inflamed them. Not the mob—but the men who have
    gathered, excited, and directed the mob. We say without hesitation, that James
    Watson Webb and Col. Stone should be held pre-eminently responsible for the
    late notorious proceedings in the city of New York. Their papers, ‘the Courier
    and Enquirer,’ and the ‘Commercial Advertiser,’ have been, for more than a
    year past, industriously circulating (through a larger portion of the
    community, than any other paper could,) the grossest misrepresentations of the
    sentiments and purposes of the Abolitionists. They have done all in their
    power to awaken the hatred, and&nbsp; direct the blind zeal of the ignorant,
    reckless, and unprincipled against a portion of their fellow citizens, whose
    only offence is, that they are pleading the cause of bleeding humanity—ay, the
    cause of millions of Americans, who are held in abject bondage, or paralyzing
    degradation. Paragraphs have repeatedly appeared in their papers, which more
    than intimated that any measures should be resorted to, for the suppression of
    the Abolitionists. It was owing to the exertions of the ‘Courier and Enquirer’
    and the ‘Commercial Advertiser,’ that the disgraceful proceedings took place
    there last fall, intended to prevent the formation of the New-York
    Anti-Slavery Society. And we may fairly attribute to them, more perhaps than
    to any other agents of the pro slavery party, the succession of riots that
    have recently occurred. —The style, in which Messrs. Webb and Stone have
    remarked upon these transactions, (more than half excusing) is&nbsp; adapted,
    if it be not designed, to urge on the populace to further outrage.
  </p>
  <p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp;Now we would ask the intelligent and candid, what does this
    procedure of the pro slavery party prove? What, but that they are conscious
    they cannot meet the opposers of American oppression and cruelty, in fair
    discussion!—If they could disprove our statements, refute our arguments, or
    turn the point of our appeal, are they indeed such men, that they would still,
    of choice, resort to the base means they have been using? We are unwilling to
    think they are so bad. Is it not rather because they foresee that moral means
    can never effect their purposes, that they resort to brute force?&nbsp; We
    think so. Let the intelligent and candid judge.—
    <em>Brooklyn Unionist.</em>

scholarlyNotes: I've placed this at July 24 issue
commentary: 'The riots in New York City directly affected many of the students at
  the Canterbury Female Academy. Black churches, Black businesses, and white abolitionists
  were attacked viciously. Numerous ebndorsers of the Canterbury Female Academy were
  singled out, most notably Peter Williams Jr. and Arthur Tappan. For an interesting
  discovery about these riots, see https://blog.mcny.org/2012/04/03/the-abolitionist-riots-of-1834/ '
