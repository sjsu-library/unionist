  name without a wife! Shame, Burleigh!”<br></p> <p>The same article appears in the<br>  <em>Vermont
  Centinel</em>  28 March 1834, with one small change: the proper name of "Burleigh"
  is elimimated.<br></p><p>  “The Editor of the Taunton Whig says that his wife is

scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: 'This set of ripostes is most noteworthy for the Burleighs'' calling attention
  to a man who values his wife for her accomplishments. Both of these newspapers were
  friendly to Abolition, so these are good-natured teases rather than hostile attacks. '
