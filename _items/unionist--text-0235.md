transcription: '<p> “The Editor of the Taunton Whig says that his wife is a “very
  elegant and accomplished lady"— <em>We, the People.</em> </p> <p> Good! The man
  is in his senses.—Such a husband is worth having—isn’t he, girls?—“<em>Unionist”</em>
  </p> <p> We doubt whether the Unionist man is in his senses, to print a paper with
  such a name without a wife! Shame, Burleigh!” </p> <p>The same article appears in
  the <em>Vermont Centinel</em> 28 March 1834, with one small change: the proper name
  of "Burleigh" is eliminated. </p> <p> “The Editor of the Taunton Whig says that
  his wife is a “very elegant and accomplished lady— <em>We, the People.</em> </p>
  <p> Good! The man is in his senses.—Such a husband is worth having—isn’t he, girls?—“
  <em>Unionist”</em> </p> <p> We doubt whether the “Unionist” man is in his senses,
  to print a paper with such a name without a wife! Shame! </p> <p></p> '
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: 'This set of ripostes is most noteworthy for the Burleighs'' calling attention
  to a man who values his wife for her accomplishments. Both of these newspapers were
  friendly to Abolition, so these are good-natured teases rather than hostile attacks. '
