transcription: 'As the Unionist has requested, we have reperused our remarks upon
  the conduct and designs of the abolitionists, and we find little to modify and nothing
  to retract. To the charge of severity and injustice towards the characters of the
  leaders in this crusade, we reply— <em>Physician heal thyselfˆ–</em> clear your
  own eyes of motes and films before you proceed to pull out beams from the eyes of
  others. The whole vocabulary of abuse and contumely has been exhausted by the abolitionists
  in their attempts to defame the motives and blacken the characters of the members
  of the Colonization society—so that now we scarcely see aught else in the columns
  of the Liberator and Emancipator, but numerous repetitions of the same false and
  unfounded charges. Indeed, one would think, from the matter contained in those papers,
  that their <em>sole</em> object is to destroy the Colonization society; as if that
  being accomplished, every thing else was easy. Now let the merits of abolitionism
  be ten times what its warmest abettors assert, no reasonable objection can be made
  to the Colonization Society whatever. It proposes to transport free blacks to Africa
  with their own consent, and if the blacks are willing to go, pray may not <em>free
  white</em> men give their money for the purpose without asking the consent of the
  President of the Anti-Slavery Society? Where was the kindness and charity of Garrison,
  yea more, where was his regard for moral probity, when he said that his object in
  going to England was to raise funds for the establishment of a manual labor school—and
  now, since his return, he acknowledges that he was induced to the voyage by a desire
  to represent (misrepresent he should have said) the object and designs of the Colonization
  Society to the English. That he slandered his countrymen in London, there is abundant
  proof. Since he returned, he denies it—so that no less than four falsehoods lie
  at his door, without the possibility of any good accruing from either. How much
  was there “of the law of kindness as well as of the requisitions of justice” in
  the latter which the patron of the Unionist wrote to some students, and which he
  requested might be published; when he said that he looked upon the Colonization
  Society <em>in no other light than an emissary of Satan</em> —whose only object
  is to perpetuate slavery? And who have been more frequently accused of falsehood
  and misrepresentation than Rev. Mr. Gurley and Mr. Finley? We do not ask these questions
  to justify ourselves if we have done wrong, but merely to, let our “brother” see
  that it ill becomes him to throw stones. Till he &amp; his sect are free from sin
  they should be slow in condemning others. As to what we asserted concerning the
  leaders in the abolition enterprize, we deem it strictly true. When they are told
  that the constitution forbids the free states from meddling with property at the
  south, they reply in the language of the Apostle to the Jewish Ruler—we must obey
  God and not man—thus asserting their independence of the laws under which we live.
  If they respect the laws, why does not Miss Crandall dismiss her school? Till the
  decision of Judge Dagget is over ruled, that decision is the law of the land, which
  every honest citizen is bound to respect—and yet we see the Genius of Temperance,
  (the Editors of which call themselves Christians par excellence) encouraging her
  to continue in opposition to a decree of one of the highest tribunals in the state.
  We find the abolitionists endeavoring to cast contempt upon the Colonization Society,
  because the latter speak of what is expedient to be done, in opposition to the designs
  of the&nbsp; former—and meeting in the writings of a gentleman of talents and learning,
  a quotation about expediency being “a wrap-rascal,” they have rung the charges upon
  it, till it has fairly become stale, not forgetting in the excess of their charity
  to insinuate that whoever may doubt of the expediency of a measure, there can be
  no question as to the character which such person&nbsp; should sustain in their
  own immaculate conceptions. Did these over scrupulous gentlemen every hear or read
  of one who said that “all things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient.”
  In the present state of the country immediate and unconditional abolition is neither
  <em>expedient</em> nor <em>lawful</em> —and those engaged in promoting it are only
  planting the seeds of sedition. Let them beware that in sowing the wind, they do
  not reap the whirlwind. '
