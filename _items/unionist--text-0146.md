transcription: As the Unionist has requested, we have reperused our remarks upon the
  conduct <br>and designs of the abolitionists, and we find little to modify and nothing
  to <br>retract. To the charge of severity and injustice towards the characters of
  the <br>leaders in this crusade, we reply— <br><em>Physician heal thyselfˆ–</em>clear
  your own eyes of motes and films before you proceed to pull out beams from <br>the
  eyes of others. The whole vocabulary of abuse and contumely has been <br>exhausted
  by the abolitionists in their attempts to defame the motives and <br>blacken the
  characters of the members of the Colonization society—so that now we <br>scarcely
  see aught else in the columns of the Liberator and Emancipator, but <br>numerous
  repetitions of the same false and unfounded charges. Indeed, one would <br>think,
  from the matter contained in those papers, that their <br><em>sole</em>object is
  to destroy the Colonization society; as if that being accomplished, <br>every thing
  else was easy. Now let the merits of abolitionism be ten times what <br>its warmest
  abettors assert, no reasonable objection can be made to the <br>Colonization Society
  whatever. It proposes to transport free blacks to Africa <br>with their own consent,
  and if the blacks are willing to go, pray may not <br><em>free white</em>men give
  their money for the purpose without asking the consent of the President <br>of the
  Anti-Slavery Society? Where was the kindness and charity of Garrison, yea <br>more,
  where was his regard for moral probity, when he said that his object in <br>going
  to England was to raise funds for the establishment of a manual labor <br>school—and
  now, since his return, he acknowledges that he was induced to the <br>voyage by
  a desire to represent (misrepresent he should have said) the object <br>and designs
  of the Colonization Society to the English. That he slandered his <br>countrymen
  in London, there is abundant proof. Since he returned, he denies <br>it—so that
  no less than four falsehoods lie at his door, without the possibility <br>of any
  good accruing from either. How much was there “of the law of kindness as <br>well
  as of the requisitions of justice” in the latter which the patron of the <br>Unionist
  wrote to some students, and which he requested might be published; when <br>he said
  that he looked upon the Colonization Society <br><em>in no other light than an emissary
  of Satan</em>—whose only object is to perpetuate slavery? And who have been more
  frequently <br>accused of falsehood and misrepresentation than Rev. Mr. Gurley and
  Mr. Finley? <br>We do not ask these questions to justify ourselves if we have done
  wrong, but <br>merely to, let our “brother” see that it ill becomes him to throw
  stones. Till <br>he &amp; his sect are free from sin they should be slow in condemning
  others. As <br>to what we asserted concerning the leaders in the abolition enterprize,
  we deem <br>it strictly true. When they are told that the constitution forbids the
  free <br>states from meddling with property at the south, they reply in the language
  of <br>the Apostle to the Jewish Ruler—we must obey God and not man—thus asserting
  <br>their independence of the laws under which we live. If they respect the laws,
  <br>why does not Miss Crandall dismiss her school? Till the decision of Judge Dagget
  <br>is over ruled, that decision is the law of the land, which every honest citizen
  <br>is bound to respect—and yet we see the Genius of Temperance, (the Editors of
  <br>which call themselves Christians par excellence) encouraging her to continue
  in <br>opposition to a decree of one of the highest tribunals in the state. We find
  the <br>abolitionists endeavoring to cast contempt upon the Colonization Society,
  <br>because the latter speak of what is expedient to be done, in opposition to the
  <br>designs of the&nbsp; former—and meeting in the&nbsp; writings of a gentleman
  of <br>talents and learning, a quotation about&nbsp; expediency being “a wrap-rascal,”
  <br>they have rung the charges upon it, till it has fairly become stale, not <br>forgetting
  in the excess of their charity to insinuate that whoever may doubt of <br>the expediency
  of a measure, there can be no question as to the character which <br>such person&nbsp;
  should sustain in their own immaculate conceptions. Did these <br>over scrupulous
  gentlemen every hear or read of one who said that “all things <br>are lawful for
  me, but all things are not expedient.” In the present state of <br>the country immediate
  and unconditional abolition is neither <br><em>expedient</em>nor <br><em>lawful</em>—and
  those engaged in promoting it are only planting the seeds of sedition. Let <br>them
  beware that in sowing the wind, they do not reap the whirlwind. <br>
