transcription: An Irish servant lad, going along the passage, and singing rather<br>inharmoniously,
  was asked by his master what horrid noise he was making? “I have<br>not made any
  noise, sir,” he replied. “Why, you were singing, and a confounded<br>noise it was.”
  “Oh, perhaps it was the singing of my ears your honor heard.”<br>This reminds us
  of a dialogue between two ministers of the gude kirk of<br>Scotland. One complained
  that he had got a ringing in his head. “Do ye ken the<br>reason o’ that?” asked
  his worthy crony. “Na!” “I’ll tell ye; ‘tis because it’s<br>empty!” “And have ye
  never a ringing in your head?” quoth the other. “Na,<br>never.” “And do ye ken the
  reason?,’ “Na.” “It’s because it’s cracked!” was the<br>retort; and the truth was
  not very far off.<br>
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: Humor based on ethnic stereotypes and denigration is, as usual, prevelant
  in the human condition but not our best feature. However, the reference to things
  which are cracked, this opens the window to consider the use of The Liberty Bell
  as a symbol by the Abolitionists. This is both because of its use of the Biblical
  phrase "Proclaim LIBERTY Throughout all the Land unto all the Inhabitants Thereof"
  (Leviticus 25:10), but also the patent lack of extending freedom to all the inhabitants
  that the persistence of slavery represented. The Abolitionists rescued the Liberty
  Bell from post-revolutionary obscurity and made it a potent icon for freedom once
  again.
