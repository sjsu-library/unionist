caption: Charles Stuart, shown in a detail from Benjamin Robert Haydon's depiction
  of the 1840 Anti-Slavery Convention in London. He is the man in the middle here.
  For someone so important in the Abolitionist movement in both England and the United
  States, it is odd that there is no better portrait of him. Stuart was a particularly
  important supporter of Crandall and the Canterbury Female Academy. However, he later
  proved himself to be hostile to women's equal participation. Thus he was among the
  bulk of the delegates at this major International Anti-Slavery convention who refused
  the seating of the women delegates from the United States. This was the conference
  where Elizabeth Cady Stanton met Lucretia Mott.
