transcription: On Tuesday afternoon, about 2 o’clock, the House of Miss Crandall,
  in<br>Canterbury, was discovered to be on Fire, in a place and under circumstances<br>which
  render the origin of it inexplicable. The smoke and flame burst out from<br>between
  the plastering and outer covering, in the corner of one of the front<br>rooms, farthest
  from the fire place. The inmates of the dwelling were very much<br>terrified, but
  with the assistance of the inhabitants of the village, soon<br>extinguished the
  flames.—<br><em>Unionist</em>.<br>
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: It is interesting that the <em>Norwich Courier</em> publisehd <em>The
  Unionist</em> account of the fire at the academy in January 1834.
