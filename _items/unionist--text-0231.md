transcription: 'On Tuesday afternoon, about 2 o’clock, the House of Miss Crandall,
  in Canterbury, was discovered to be on Fire, in a place and under circumstances
  which render the origin of it inexplicable. The smoke and flame burst out from between
  the plastering and outer covering, in the corner of one of the front rooms, farthest
  from the fire place. The inmates of the dwelling were very much terrified, but with
  the assistance of the inhabitants of the village, soon extinguished the flames.—
  <em>Unionist</em> . '
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: It is interesting that the <em>Norwich Courier</em> publisehd <em>The
  Unionist</em> account of the fire at the academy in January 1834.
