  on the 3d Tuesday, i.e. the 15 <sup>th</sup> day of April. The delegates are requested
  to meet at the new church at 1 oâ€™clock, P. M. The public services are to commence
  at 2. La Fayette S. Foster Esq. of Hampton is to give the Address. It is very desirable
  that each auxiliary not only send delegates to the meeting; but forward to the Secretary
  their annual report as soon as possible, that a full and favorable account of this
  County Society may be given to the meeting of the State Society in May.&nbsp;&nbsp;
  G. J. TILLOTSON, Sec. '
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: La Fayette S. Foster (1806-1880) was an anti-slavery advocate and later
  a prominent U.S. Senator from Connecticut. It is likely that he was also the person
  whose transcription of the trial of Frederick Olney is included in <em>The Unionist</em>.
