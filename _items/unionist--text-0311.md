transcription: <p>  “Although we entertain not the slightest doubt as to the success
  of Mr. Pearl<br>  in the 13<br>  <sup>th</sup>  Senatorial District, we cannot but
  urge upon our friends in every town in this<br>  district, the necessity of prompt
  action at the ballot boxes on Monday next.<br>  It is not enough that we merely
  elect our candidate. Let us show our friends<br>  in other parts of the State, that
  we are as strong in numerical numbers, (<br><em>numerical numbers!</em>) as we are
  zealous in defence<br>  <em>(sic)</em> of sound principles. By a thorough turn out
  this Spring, we shall give our<br>  opponents no opportunity to boast even of an
  increase of numbers over us,<br>  since the last election. On the contrary, we shall
  have the satisfaction of<br>  witnessing an accession to our ranks.—<br>  <em>Advertiser,
  April</em>  8.<br></p><p>  What a sagacious prediction! And how wonderfully verified
  by the event! Mr.<br>  Pearl, of whose success "we have not the<br> <em>slightest</em>  doubt,”
  and who was even to have been elected by an increased majority, such<br>  was the
  strength in “<em>numerical numbers,</em>” of the Jackson party in this district,
  comes between three and four hundred<br>  votes short of an election; and his opponent
  is chosen by a majority of more<br>  than three hundred. What an “accession” to
  the strength of the self-styled<br>  democratic party! For some reason or other,
  it would seem that the plain,<br>  honest, intelligent <em>people</em>  of this
  district can’t be made to believe that Democracy and Jacksonism<br>  <em>are</em>  precisely
  synonymous terms, and the old Democrats are so obstinate, that they<br>  won’t act
  as if they did believe it when they don’t. How much their confidence<br>  in the
  assertions and predictions of the Advertiser will be strengthened by<br>  the result
  of this election we cannot exactly say, but no doubt the election<br>  of Anti-Jackson
  representatives in every town in the county except one, and<br>  there of a doubtful
  one, and the choice of both the Anti-Jackson Senators by<br>  triumphant majorities,
  will have due weight in the people’s minds in settling<br>  that point, as well
  as in estimating the future prospects of Jacksonism in<br>  this country.<br></p><p></p>
