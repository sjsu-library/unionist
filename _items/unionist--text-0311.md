    “Although we entertain not the slightest doubt as to the success of Mr. Pearl
    in the 13
    <sup>th</sup>
    Senatorial District, we cannot but urge upon our friends in every town in this
    district, the necessity of prompt action at the ballot boxes on Monday next.
    It is not enough that we merely elect our candidate. Let us show our friends
    in other parts of the State, that we are as strong in numerical numbers, (
  <em>numerical numbers!</em>
  ) as we are zealous in defence
    <em>(sic)</em>
   of sound principles. By a thorough turn out this Spring, we shall give our
    opponents no opportunity to boast even of an increase of numbers over us,
    since the last election. On the contrary, we shall have the satisfaction of
    witnessing an accession to our ranks.—
    <em>Advertiser, April</em>
    8.
  </p>
  <p>
    What a sagacious prediction! And how wonderfully verified by the event! Mr.
    Pearl, of whose success "we have not the
   <em>slightest</em>
    doubt,” and who was even to have been elected by an increased majority, such
    was the strength in “<em>numerical numbers,</em>” of the Jackson party in this district, comes between three and four hundred
    votes short of an election; and his opponent is chosen by a majority of more
    than three hundred. What an “accession” to the strength of the self-styled
    democratic party! For some reason or other, it would seem that the plain,
    honest, intelligent <em>people</em>
    of this district can’t be made to believe that Democracy and Jacksonism
    <em>are</em>
    precisely synonymous terms, and the old Democrats are so obstinate, that they
    won’t act as if they did believe it when they don’t. How much their confidence
    in the assertions and predictions of the Advertiser will be strengthened by
    the result of this election we cannot exactly say, but no doubt the election
    of Anti-Jackson representatives in every town in the county except one, and
    there of a doubtful one, and the choice of both the Anti-Jackson Senators by
    triumphant majorities, will have due weight in the people’s minds in settling
    that point, as well as in estimating the future prospects of Jacksonism in
    this country.
