caption: Photograph of William Goodell (1792-1878), editor of <em>The Genius of Temperance</em>.
  Goodell's contributions to the reform movements are undervalued; he connected Abolition
  to Black citizenship, women's rights, labor, and critique of market economics. He
  was especially galvanized by Crandall's school. See Julie Holcumb, <em>Moral Commerce</em>,
  143-144, and fn. 86 p. 232.
