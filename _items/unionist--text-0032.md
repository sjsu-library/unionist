transcription: Our neighbor calls the Unionist “the <em>pattern</em> of newspaper
  perfection." We hope he will imitate the “pattern” in point of “independence,” so
  far at least as to copy the reply of Mr. May to the letter of Messrs. Adams and
  Judson, since we have inserted their letter in our columns.
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: Charles Burleigh again says that Holbrook's claim to print both sides
  had been made disingeuously
