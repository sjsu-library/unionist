transcription: We are glad to see, in “The Unionist,” of Windham County, the second
  of a series<br>of numbers well written, and designed to expose the corruptions of
  Freemasonry.<br>This is candid, just and patriotic. Let it go on.<br>
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: My educated guess is that this (at least) two-part series on Anti-Masonry
  would have appeared in the latter issues in April, such as April 17 (1:37) and April
  24 (1:38). Given their wide-ranging reform interests, either Charles or William
  could have been the authors.
