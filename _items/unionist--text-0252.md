transcription: "<p> <em>The Fire at Canterbury—</em> Mr. Frederick Olney has had his
  trial on the charge of having set fire to Miss Crandall’s house; and he has been
  fully acquitted. We trust, not the slightest suspicion of his guilt remains on the
  mind of any disinterested persons, who heard the trial. The jury would probably
  have given their verdict without leaving their seats, if they had previously chosen
  a foreman. But so soon as they had retired to their room and organized, they gave
  a unanimous vote in his favor. And this they might have done if they had heard only
  the evidence on the part of the State—for the testimony of some of the witnesses
  brought forward by the public prosecutor, went to show clearly that even if the
  fire were communicated on the inside, Mr. Olney could not have done it. </p> <p>
  Now, therefore, that Col. Judson and his coadjutors have been permitted to indulge
  their suspicions to the utmost, and to subject a perfectly innocent man to the mortification
  and expense of a criminal prosecution, because he happened to be on the <em>inside</em>
  of Miss Crandall’s house on the day of the fire, now, we seriously hope that he
  and they will look diligently among those on the <em>outside</em> of the house for
  the real incendiary. No one, we trust, is willing to suspect that the Col. or any
  of the respectable people in Canterbury, did the deed; but there probably are persons
  in the town capable of such a crime—or some who might do it without considering
  it would be a <em>crime</em> thus, or in any other way, to “break up” the “nigger
  school.” Col. Judson and his fellow laborers against that school have done all in
  their power to excite the most virulent and reckless hostility to it. We were ourselves
  present in the famous town meeting on the 9 <sup>th</sup> of March, 1833, and there
  we heard enough said by the Col. and his colleagues to instigate persons of a certain
  character to violence against the school. It is notorious that minor acts of violence
  have repeatedly been committed against her house—and they must not wonder if those
  who have thrown stones and rotten eggs and filth, with impunity if not with applause,
  should be emboldened to apply even the slow match. That this or something like this
  was meditated the public are compelled to believe by the article in the Advertiser
  of Dec. 19 <sup>th*</sup> —and will not all have reason to suspect that the Col.
  and his coadjutors and the public prosecutor are leagued to protect the real culprit,
  unless they now set about in earnest to find him, in the direction pointed out by
  Mr. Holbrook? This mysterious affair ought to be cleared up. No one could rejoice
  more than we should do to have it satisfactory proved, that the fire was accidental.
  But there appears to be scarcely any doubt that it was the work of an incendiary.
  Therefore let the felon be hunted for without further delay. Mr. Holbrook has refused
  to give to the public at our request, and has even refused to give to Miss Crandall,
  an explanation of his meaning in the article to which we have so often alluded.
  But Col. Judson and the State’s Attorney can doubtless elicit from him the information
  which has so long been called for in vain. </p> "
