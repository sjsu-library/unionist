transcription: "<p>  <em>The Fire at Canterbury—</em>  Mr. Frederick Olney has had
  his trial on the charge of having set fire to Miss<br>  Crandall’s house; and he
  has been fully acquitted. We trust, not the slightest<br>  suspicion of his guilt
  remains on the mind of any disinterested persons, who<br>  heard the trial. The
  jury would probably have given their verdict without<br>  leaving their seats, if
  they had previously chosen a foreman. But so soon as<br>  they had retired to their
  room and organized, they gave a unanimous vote in<br>  his favor. And this they
  might have done if they had heard only the evidence<br>  on the part of the State—for
  the testimony of some of the witnesses brought<br>  forward by the public prosecutor,
  went to show clearly that even if the fire<br>  were communicated on the inside,
  Mr. Olney could not have done it.<br></p><p>  Now, therefore, that Col. Judson and
  his coadjutors have been permitted to<br>  indulge their suspicions to the utmost,
  and to subject a perfectly innocent<br>  man to the mortification and expense of
  a criminal prosecution, because he<br>  happened to be on the<br>  <em>inside</em>
  \ of Miss Crandall’s house on the day of the fire, now, we seriously hope the he<br>
  \ and they will look diligently among those on the<br>  <em>outside</em>  of the
  house for the real incendiary. No one, we trust, is willing to suspect<br>  that
  the Col. or any of the respectable people in Canterbury, did the deed;<br>  but
  there probably are persons in the town capable of such a crime—or some who<br>  might
  do it without considering it would be a<br>  <em>crime</em>  thus, or in any other
  way, to “break up” the “nigger school.” Col. Judson and<br>  his fellow laborers
  against that school have done all in their power to excite<br>  the most virulent
  and reckless hostility to it. We were ourselves present in<br>  the famous town
  meeting on the 9<sup>th</sup>  of March, 1833, and there we heard enough said by
  the Col. and his colleagues<br>  to instigate persons of a certain character to
  violence against the school. It<br>  is notorious that minor acts of violence have
  repeatedly been committed<br>  against her house—and they must not wonder if those
  who have thrown stones and<br>  rotten eggs and filth, with impunity if not with
  applause, should be<br>  emboldened to apply even the slow match. That this or something
  like this was<br>  meditated the public are compelled to believe by the article
  in the Advertiser<br>  of Dec. 19<sup>th*</sup>  —and will not all have reason to
  suspect that the Col. and his coadjutors and<br>  the public prosecutor are leagued
  to protect the real culprit, unless they now<br>  set about in earnest to find him,
  in the direction pointed out by Mr.<br>  Holbrook? This mysterious affair ought
  to be cleared up. No one could rejoice<br>  more than we should do to have it satisfactory
  proved, that the fire was<br>  accidental. But there appears to be scarcely any
  doubt that it was the work of<br>  an incendiary. Therefore let the felon be hunted
  for without further delay.<br>  Mr. Holbrook has refused to give to the public at
  our request, and has even<br>  refused to give to Miss Crandall, an explanation
  of his meaning in the article<br>  to which we have so often alluded. But Col. Judson
  and the State’s Attorney<br>  can doubtless elicit from him the information which
  has so long been called<br>  for in vain.<br></p>"
