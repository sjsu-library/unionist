transcription: "<p> “We copy the following from the Brooklyn Advertiser. We thank
  our <em>brother</em> for <em>showing up</em> his neighbor so handsomely.” </p> <p>
  {continuous reading, new quoted paragraph} “”A GOOD ONE.—The editors of the Unionist,
  ask their readers to <em>excuse</em> their “ample notice of the Norwich Courier,”
  and add, “we never hesitate to do battle with any one who is worthy of our notice.”
  It therefore seems that the Unionist editors are sensible of the <em>fact</em> that
  an object worthy of <em>their</em> notice is <em>unworthy</em> the notice of their
  readers; else why do they ask their readers to excuse them? And what is still more
  amusing, the Unionist intimates that the Courier is worthy of <em>its</em> notice,
  when the Courier only week before last, sent the Unionist a budging, (and as we
  think, with a sore head,) at the same time declaring that is, (the Courier) had
  no spare room to devote to any further notice of the Unionist! The would-be independent
  editors, should, in the first place, be sure than an opponent will notice <em>them,</em>
  and then they can talk about condescending to notice that opponent, with a better
  grace.”” </p> "
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: 'The text of this small-minded riposte makes it clear that Charles and
  William were co-editors of <em>The Unionist</em> by December '
