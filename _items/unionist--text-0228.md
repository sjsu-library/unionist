transcription: "<p>  “We copy the following from the Brooklyn Advertiser. We thank
  our<br>  <em>brother</em>  for<br>  <em>showing up</em>  his neighbor so handsomely.”<br></p><p>
  \ {continuous reading, new quoted paragraph} “”A GOOD ONE.—The editors of the<br>
  \ Unionist, ask their readers to<br>  <em>excuse</em>  their “ample notice of the
  Norwich Courier,” and add, “we never hesitate to do<br>  battle with any one who
  is worthy of our notice.” It therefore seems that the<br>  Unionist editors are
  sensible of the<br>  <em>fact</em>  that an object worthy of<br>  <em>their</em>
  \ notice is<br>  <em>unworthy</em>  the notice of their readers; else why do they
  ask their readers to excuse<br>  them? And what is still more amusing, the Unionist
  intimates that the Courier<br>  is worthy of<br>  <em>its</em>  notice, when the
  Courier only week before last, sent the Unionist a budging,<br>  (and as we think,
  with a sore head,) at the same time declaring that is, (the<br>  Courier) had no
  spare room to devote to any further notice of the Unionist!<br>  The would-be independent
  editors, should, in the first place, be sure than an<br>  opponent will notice<br>
  \ <em>them,</em>  and then they can talk about condescending to notice that opponent,
  with a<br>  better grace.””<br></p>"

commentary: 'The text of this small-minded riposte makes it clear that Charles and
  William were co-editors of <em>The Unionist</em> by December '
