transcription: "<p>  “The Middletown Sentinel and Witness, contains a statement from
  a man who says<br>  that he saw an<br>  <em>Angel</em>  at Chatham, Con.—that the
  Angel communicated the important intelligence that<br>  Hannah Marsh and Caroline
  Blood had experienced religion,—that somebody<br>  had turned Universalist,—and
  that the world would pass away before the year<br>  1848.”<br></p><p>  “The Editor
  of Brooklyn Unionist, (advocating we<br>  believe a<br>  <em>union</em>  between
  the white and black races) in remarking on this statement, says<br>  <em>he</em>
  \ sees half-a-dozen Angels a day with<br>  <em>pouting</em>  lips;—the man must
  half fallen in love with “half a dozen” misses of color!”<br>  Verily, we opine
  that he would not be united to one of the charming Philisses<br>  <em>very</em>
  \ long, before he would become an advocate of<br>  <em>immediate emancipation.</em>
  \ ”<br></p>"

  as it mocks the accomplishment of Phillis Wheatley, the Black woman poet of the
