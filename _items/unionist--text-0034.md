transcription: "<p>THE CANTERBURY AFFAIR. The Emancipator asserts on the authority
  of Mr John G Whittier, that the excitement against Miss Crandall, <em>first</em>
  arose from her admitting a pious negro girl, who wished to qualify herself for the
  employment of teaching, into her school, to which no colored pupils had <em>then</em>
  been admitted; and that the opposition thus excited against her, led her to establish
  her school for colored Misses. We wish to know, for a certainty, whether this is
  “the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.” It makes the Canterbury
  affair much worse than any former account of it.—<em>Vermont Chronicle.</em></p>
  <p>The editor of the Chronicle will find an answer to his question in the letter
  of Miss Crandall, a copy of which we shall send him. It may not be amiss, however
  to remark, as this may come under the eye of some who have not perused Miss C’s.
  letter, that the Emancipator has, we believe, given a statement substantially correct.</p>"
