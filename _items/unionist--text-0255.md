    <em>Mr. Burleigh</em>
    —You remember I promised to write again as soon as we had received another
    Bulletin. Uncle Davy Kies seems to think they are
    <em>“All Hearty”</em>
    but you know he don’t reside at Head-Quarters now. The last orders were dated
    at Canterbury a few rods North of Miss Crandall’s school. It was officially
    announced here this morning by one of the recruiting officers, (the
    <em>gentleman</em>
    who ran away from Brooklyn a few years ago with some hundreds of the people’s
    money, and who, in consequence of his clamorous declamations in favor of
    Jackson, is now enjoying a considerable bite of Uncle Sam’s treasury pap,
    against the known wishes of the people,) that Uncle Davy’s Democrats were all
    ready for action. That the misunderstanding and difficulty among the officers
    had blown over and all were as good friends as ever. Col. A.T. the commanding
    officer, is looking out for promotion. Uncle Davy says when all the officers
    of his division get together this Spring at New-Haven, he will have the Col.
    appointed Commissary, Judge, or something which he will like much better than
    actual service in the field, and thus give a better chance for the under
    officers. But the Col. would be altogether out of his place, on the bench. He
    would appear, and no doubt feel, much like Jack Downing’s mouse, treed in an
    empty flour barrel.—The old gentleman has not concluded yet whether to issue
    another Proclamation or not—but he says something must be done to procure more
    soldiers. He don’t seem to like the appearance of the old Republican army, and
    what looks more cloudy than any thing else, he don’t think it will do to come
    into action till he gets a new recruit from Windham. But every good soldier
    listed in the Republican army just as soon as they found out what Uncle
    Davy and the ‘Arch Bishop’ were up to. You might as well undertake to make
    Bull-Frog pond run right over ‘Zion’s Hill’ as to get one of the Republicans
    to join the enemy.

    We have just nominated our candidate to represent this district in the next
    Legislature. But he don’t care any thing about the office. Col. Spafford is
    one of the genuine old fashioned republicans, a straight forward, common sense
    man, who, if he should be elected, will do the thing that is right. He is not
    for abolishing Sabbath laws, or Thanksgiving laws. He believes in none of the
    new-fangled black laws, or New-Haven memorials, but will go straight a-head as
    every independent republican should do, supporting such measures only as will
    operate equally upon all our citizens. He will never consent, like Mr. Pearl,
    to put his eggs in Judson’s basket.

scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: The candidate running against Philip Pearl was Col. George Spafford (1793-1848),
  of Windham. He is described in this letter as being against the Black Law and the
  racism of New Haven
