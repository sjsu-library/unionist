  align="right">  WINDHAM, March 11<sup>th</sup>  , 1834<br></p><p>  <em>Mr. Burleigh</em>  —You
  remember I promised to write again as soon as we had received another<br>  Bulletin.
  Uncle Davy Kies seems to think they are<br>  <em>“All Hearty”</em>  but you know
  he don’t reside at Head-Quarters now. The last orders were dated<br>  at Canterbury
  a few rods North of Miss Crandall’s school. It was officially<br>  announced here
  this morning by one of the recruiting officers, (the<br>  <em>gentleman</em>  who
  ran away from Brooklyn a few years ago with some hundreds of the people’s<br>  money,
  and who, in consequence of his clamorous declamations in favor of<br>  Jackson,
  is now enjoying a considerable bite of Uncle Sam’s treasury pap,<br>  against the
  known wishes of the people,) that Uncle Davy’s Democrats were all<br>  ready for
  action. That the misunderstanding nad difficulty among the officers<br>  had blown
  over and all were as good friends as ever. Col. A.T. the commanding<br>  officer,
  is looking out for promotion. Uncle Davy says when all the officers<br>  of his
  division get together this Spring at New-Haven, he will have the Col.<br>  appointed
  Commissary, Judge, or something which he will like much better than<br>  actual
  service in the field, and thus give a better chance for the under<br>  officers.
  But the Col. would be altogether out of his place, on the bench. He<br>  would appear,
  and no doubt feel, much like Jack Downing’s mouse, treed in an<br>  empty flour
  barrel.—The old gentleman has not concluded yet whether to issue<br>  another Proclamation
  or not—but he says something must be done to procure more<br>  soldiers. He don’t
  seem to like the appearance of the old Republican army, and<br>  what looks more
  cloudy than any thing else, he don’t think it will do to come<br>  into action till
  he gets a new recruit from Windham. But every good soldier<br>  listed in the Republican
  army just as soon as&nbsp; they found out what Uncle<br>  Davy and the ‘Arch Bishop’
  were up to. You might as well undertake to make<br>  Bull-Frog pond run right over
  ‘Zion’s Hill’ as to get one of the Republicans<br>  to join the enemy.<br></p><p>  We
  have just nominated our candidate to represent this district in the next<br>  Legislature.
  But he don’t care any thing about the office. Col. Spafford is<br>  one of the genuine
  old fashioned republicans, a straight forward, common sense<br>  man, who, if he
  should be elected, will do the thing that is right. He is not<br>  for abolishing
  Sabbath laws, or Thanksgiving laws. He believes in none of the<br>  new-fangled
  black laws, or New-Haven memorials, but will go straight a-head as<br>  every independent
  republican should do, supporting such measures only as will<br>  operate equally
  upon all our citizens. He will never consent, like Mr. Pearl,<br>  to put his eggs
  in Judson’s basket.<br></p><p align="right">REPUBLICAN ELECTOR</p>
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: The candidate running against Philip Pearl was Col. George Spafford (1793-1848),
  of Windham. He is described in this letter as being against the Black Law and the
  racism of New Haven
