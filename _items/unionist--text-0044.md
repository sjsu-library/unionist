transcription: "“She was in her own house, and as we suppose in her native State,
  using her own property, talents and time for the noblest purposes, according to
  the sentiments of President Dwight, which we lately published in this paper. For
  this christian and noble employment, she is taken by the violent hand of persecution
  and confined in a prison. What were the complaints and censures against Georgia,
  for similar conduct towards the imprisoned missionaries? Is such conduct in New-England,
  in Connecticut, less sinful, shameful, unjust and cruel? Whose life, liberty and
  pursuit of happiness are safe, if a christian lady is exposed to imprisonment for
  obedience to the dictates of her conscience and the evident requirements of piety,
  patriotism and philanthropy?”"
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: The Rhode Island <em>Philanthropist</em> was co-edited by Rev. Thomas
  Williams, a staunch ally of Prudence Crandall. His reference to the imprisoned missionaries
  in Georgia concerns the case of <em>Worcester v. Georgia</em> (1832), in which the
  Supreme Court attempted to stand by the rights of the Cherokee People. President
  Jackson famously ignored the Supreme Court's ruling, which paved the way for the
  eventual Trail of Tears.
