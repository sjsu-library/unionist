transcription: "“She was in her own house, and as we suppose in her native State,
  using her own<br>property, talents and time for the noblest purposes, according
  to the sentiments<br>of President Dwight, which we lately published in this paper.
  For this christian<br>and noble employment, she is taken by the violent hand of
  persecution and<br>confined in a prison. What were the complaints and censures against
  Georgia, for<br>similar conduct towards the imprisoned missionaries? Is such conduct
  in<br>New-England, in Connecticut, less sinful, shameful, unjust and cruel? Whose<br>life,
  liberty and pursuit of happiness are safe, if a christian lady is exposed<br>to
  imprisonment for obedience to the dictates of her conscience and the evident<br>requirements
  of piety, patriotism and philanthropy?”"
scholarlyNotes:
