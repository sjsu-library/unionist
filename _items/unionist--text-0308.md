    In the 13
    <sup>th</sup>
    Senatorial District George Spafford has a majority of between three and four
    hundred over Philip Pearl, Jr. the Jackson candidate. The 1
    <sup>st</sup>
    , 2d, 8
    <sup>th</sup>
    , 14
    <sup>th</sup>
    and 21
    <sup>st</sup>
    districts have elected anti-Jacksonian Senators. No returns have been received
    from the other districts.
  </p>
  <p>
    From a letter received by a gentleman in this town we gather the following
    returns: Hartford, Monday Evening. Hartford, 1
    <sup>st</sup>
    Rep. W. Hungerford 965 to 833; 2d “______ Hanks 932 to 798 both Anti Jackson
    men. In E. Hartford, E. Windsor, (majority 140) Enfield, Manchester,
    (reported) Wethersfield, Middletown, Durham, Winchester, Coventry, (reported)
    Avon, have gone Anti-Jackson. Southington doubtful. Glastonbury, Suffield and
    Mansfield are reported to have gone for Jackson candidates.

    THE ELECTION.—The returns so far as received, give strong indications that
    Jacksonism in this State is prostrated. Last year every town in the 13
    <sup>th</sup>
    District was represented by Jackson men, now only one Jackson man* goes from
    this district. The 14
    <sup>th</sup>
    District had two or three representatives who were either wholly Jackson men,
    or sometimes acted as such; now we believe not a man goes from that district
    who is not decidedly Anti-Jackson. Last year the Jackson party carried one of
    the Senators in this county. This year both Senators are Anti-Jackson, and
    elected by decisive majorities. Instead of a respectable majority
    <em>for</em>
    Pearl, as was the case last year, the 13
    <sup>th</sup>
    District now gives more than 300 majority
    <em>against</em>
    him. The intelligence which we have received from other quarters is of much
    the same character. Hartford, represented last year by Jackson men, has now
    elected the Anti-Jackson candidates by nearly 150 majority. In several other
    towns from which we have heard, similar changes have taken place. There is
    scarce room for doubt that Governor Edwards will be elected—to quit the office
    as soon as his present term expires, and that the whole Anti-Jackson State
    ticket will succeed, if not already chosen by the people. We would not affect
    an indifference which we do not feel at this result, for it is the
    accomplishment of the wish which we expressed in our prospectus, that the rule
    of the present dynasty might be brief; but though we rejoice, we feel no
    disposition to indulge in extravagant exultation at the defeat of Jacksonism.
  </p>
  <p>
    * With the exception of one, who, however, if we have been rightly informed,
    generally acted with that party in the Legislature.

commentary: |-
  Philip Pearl Jr. was defeated in his re-election bid to the State Senate, a blow to the public legitimacy of the Black Law. <em>The Unionist</em> happily reports that "Jacksonism in this State is prostrated." The editors refrain from "affect[ing]
    an indifference which we do not feel at this result, for it is the
    accomplishment of the wish which we expressed in our prospectus, that the rule
    of the present dynasty might be brief; but though we rejoice, we feel no
    disposition to indulge in extravagant exultation at the defeat of Jacksonism."
