  District George Spafford has a majority of between three and four<br>  hundred over
  Philip Pearl, Jr. the Jackson candidate. The 1<sup>st</sup>  , 2d, 8<sup>th</sup>
  \ , 14<sup>th</sup>  and 21<sup>st</sup>  districts have elected anti-Jacksonian
  Senators. No returns have been received<br>  from the other districts.<br></p><p>
  \ From a letter received by a gentleman in this town we gather the following<br>
  \ returns: Hartford, Monday Evening. Hartford, 1<sup>st</sup>  Rep. W. Hungerford
  965 to 833; 2d “______ Hanks 932 to 798 both Anti Jackson<br>  men. In E. Hartford,
  E. Windsor, (majority 140) Enfield, Manchester,<br>  (reported) Wethersfield, Middletown,
  Durham, Winchester, Coventry, (reported)<br>  Avon, have gone Anti-Jackson. Southington
  doubtful. Glastonbury, Suffield and<br>  Mansfield are reported to have gone for
  Jackson candidates.<br></p><p>  THE ELECTION.—The returns so far as received, give
  strong indications that<br>  Jacksonism in this State is prostrated. Last year every
  town in the 13<sup>th</sup>  District was represented by Jackson men, now only one
  Jackson man* goes from<br>  this district. The 14<sup>th</sup>  District had two
  or three representatives who were either wholly Jackson men,<br>  or sometimes acted
  as such; now we believe not a man goes from that district<br>  who is not decidedly
  Anti-Jackson. Last year the Jackson party carried one of<br>  the Senators in this
  county. This year both Senators are Anti-Jackson, and<br>  elected by decisive majorities.
  Instead of a respectable majority<br>  <em>for</em>  Pearl, as was the case last
  year, the 13<sup>th</sup>  District now gives more than 300 majority<br>  <em>against</em>
  \ him. The intelligence which we have received from other quarters is of much<br>
  \ the same character. Hartford, represented last year by Jackson men, has now<br>
  \ elected the Anti-Jackson candidates by nearly 150 majority. In several other<br>
  \ towns from which we have heard, similar changes have taken place. There is<br>
  \ scarce room for doubt that Governor Edwards will be elected—to quit the office<br>
  \ as soon as his present term expires, and that the whole Anti-Jackson State<br>
  \ ticket will succeed, if not already chosen by the people. We would not affect<br>
  \ an indifference which we do not feel at this result, for it is the<br>  accomplishment
  of the wish which we expressed in our prospectus, that the rule<br>  of the present
  dynasty might be brief; but though we rejoice, we feel no<br>  disposition to indulge
  in extravagant exultation at the defeat of Jacksonism.<br></p><p>  * With the exception
  of one, who, however, if we have been rightly informed,<br>  generally acted with
  that party in the Legislature.<br></p>"
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: Philip Pearl Jr. was defeated in his re-election bid to the State Senate,
  a blow to the public legitimacy of the Black Law. <em>The Unionist</em> happily
  reports that "Jacksonism in this State is prostrated." The editors refrain from
  "affect[ing]<br>  an indifference which we do not feel at this result, for it is
  the<br>  accomplishment of the wish which we expressed in our prospectus, that the
  rule<br>  of the present dynasty might be brief; but though we rejoice, we feel
  no<br>  disposition to indulge in extravagant exultation at the defeat of Jacksonism."
