transcription: "<em>Massacre of a Spanish Crew and Passengers.</em>—A Turkish galliot
  having put into a port in the island of Cyprus, on the 12<sup>th</sup>of July last,
  sailed thence about a fortnight afterwards. There were some Greek <br>sailors on
  board, who having had a dispute with the captain, conspired for his <br>destruction.
  In the end the captain, and all the crew and passengers, excepting <br>two Turkish
  sailors, were massacred. The Turks were both wounded, but during the <br>mutiny
  contrived to conceal themselves. The mutineers, having accomplished their <br>bloody—sixteen
  persons having been butchered—took to the boat. The Turkish <br>survivors, thereupon
  navigated the vessel back to Cyprus and gave the <br>information. Among those who
  were murdered, were Isidore Baguels, Procureur of <br>Spain, six <br><em>religueses</em>—two
  young men of the first family at Jerusalem—a merchant of Alexandria, and <br>two
  Jews.— <br><em>N.Y. Com. Adv</em>. <br>"
