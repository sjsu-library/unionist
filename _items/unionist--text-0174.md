  <em>Massacre of a Spanish Crew and Passengers.</em>
  —A Turkish galliot having put into a port in the island of Cyprus, on the 12
  <sup>th</sup>
  of July last, sailed thence about a fortnight afterwards. There were some Greek
  sailors on board, who having had a dispute with the captain, conspired for his
  destruction. In the end the captain, and all the crew and passengers, excepting
  two Turkish sailors, were massacred. The Turks were both wounded, but during the
  mutiny contrived to conceal themselves. The mutineers, having accomplished their
  bloody—sixteen persons having been butchered—took to the boat. The Turkish
  survivors, thereupon navigated the vessel back to Cyprus and gave the
  information. Among those who were murdered, were Isidore Baguels, Procureur of
  Spain, six
  <em>religueses</em>
  —two young men of the first family at Jerusalem—a merchant of Alexandria, and
  two Jews.—
