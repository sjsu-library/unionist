transcription: "<em>The Windham County Advertiser,</em>at Brooklyn, by J. Holbrook,
  Esq. is ably and judiciously conducted and is doing<br>much service to the democratic
  cause in that county and the region round about.<br>A friend has sent us a number
  of the Windham County Whig and Unionist, which<br>notices the late Meeting at Windham
  in true billingsgate style. This paper was<br>started as Miss Crandall’s negro vehicle,
  and was called the Unionist. This<br>female philanthropist, by her masculine zeal
  in the negro cause, has finally<br>obtained the hand of a Mr. Phileo.—Her zeal has
  now come to a “crisis,” her<br>house in Canterbury, lately occupied as a “School
  for colored Misses,” is<br>offered for sale, and the school is given up, all because
  the inhabitants stoned<br>the house in the night season, and endangered the lives
  of the “teachers and<br>colored Misses.” We suppose Mr. Calvin Phileo and his wife
  Prudence will now<br>retire to some favored retreat, and raise little Phileo’s.
  But the Unionist<br>turns Windham County Whig as Mrs. Prudence turns from her school.
  The Unionist<br>has also a small touch of the Anti Mason, and is urging the Antis
  to come into<br>the support of Trumbull, Jackson &amp; Co. It is curious to see
  the odd ends of<br>all parties, disappointed politicians, zealots in negroism, Indianism,<br>Mormonism,
  and every other mad project, finally fall in with the federal<br>party—there to
  swell occasionally, and fall still lower with the old carcase<br>[sic], while it
  is undergoing its long process of decomposition. This Unionist<br>is the foulest
  substance we have seen yet among whiggery. The very types<br>employed by this woebegone
  editor, like Balaam’s ass, refuse to perform their<br>ordinary duty.<br>"
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: Scurrilous attacks (though they are right about the printing!), hatred
  of difference, sexism, racism, religious bigotry - it's all here!
