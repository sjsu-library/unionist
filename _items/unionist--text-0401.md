transcription: "<em>The Windham County Advertiser,</em> at Brooklyn, by J. Holbrook,
  Esq. is ably and judiciously conducted and is doing much service to the democratic
  cause in that county and the region round about. A friend has sent us a number of
  the Windham County Whig and Unionist, which notices the late Meeting at Windham
  in true billingsgate style. This paper was started as Miss Crandall’s negro vehicle,
  and was called the Unionist. This female philanthropist, by her masculine zeal in
  the negro cause, has finally obtained the hand of a Mr. Phileo.—Her zeal has now
  come to a “crisis,” her house in Canterbury, lately occupied as a “School for colored
  Misses,” is offered for sale, and the school is given up, all because the inhabitants
  stoned the house in the night season, and endangered the lives of the “teachers
  and colored Misses.” We suppose Mr. Calvin Phileo and his wife Prudence will now
  retire to some favored retreat, and raise little Phileo’s. But the Unionist turns
  Windham County Whig as Mrs. Prudence turns from her school. The Unionist has also
  a small touch of the Anti Mason, and is urging the Antis to come into the support
  of Trumbull, Jackson &amp; Co. It is curious to see the odd ends of all parties,
  disappointed politicians, zealots in negroism, Indianism, Mormonism, and every other
  mad project, finally fall in with the federal party—there to swell occasionally,
  and fall still lower with the old carcase [sic], while it is undergoing its long
  process of decomposition. This Unionist is the foulest substance we have seen yet
  among whiggery. The very types employed by this woebegone editor, like Balaam’s
  ass, refuse to perform their ordinary duty. "
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: Scurrilous attacks (though they are right about the printing!), hatred
  of difference, sexism, racism, religious bigotry - it's all here! The <em>Columbian
  Register</em> was, from beginning to end, the opponent of Abolition and racial equality.
