caption: This is a widely-circulated visual meme, usually captioned "Calm Down" but
  here repurposed by The Church of Our Lady of Perpetual Succour (Singapore) to instead
  demonstrate the internal tension created by the Biblical admonition to pray for
  those who persecute you. As the writings of the students at the Canterbury Female
  Academy demonstrate, they were following this practice of praying for their enemies,
  but that doesn't mean it was easy to do!
