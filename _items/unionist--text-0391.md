transcription: We learn by the last Unionist, printed in Brooklyn, Ct., that its junior
  editor,<br>Mr. William H. Burleigh, who has for several weeks past been engaged
  as an<br>instructor in Miss Crandallâ€™s school, was on Tuesday evening last saluted
  by a<br>volley of addled eggs by some of the polite Canterburians.<br>
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: This brief notice forms a teaser to the longer letter written by William
  H. Burleigh, that was included in the June 21st 1834 issue of the Liberator. It
  is entirely possible that the editors had the letter in hand already, but insufficient
  room to run it. The importance of this small notice subsists in enabling us to date
  the attack against Burleigh as being on June 10, 1834 - "Tuesday last."
