transcription: "<em>The Mormonites.â€”</em>Some further particulars relating to the
  conflict between the Mormonites and the<br>people of Jackson county in Missouri
  are given in the St. Louis papers. It is<br>said that one Judge of the circuit,
  and several civil officers were thrown into<br>prison in consequence of an attempt
  to interfere, and detained for some hours,<br>and the Lieut. Governor had been driven
  out of the county. Almost all the people<br>of the county are concerned on one side
  or the other, so that it is supposed<br>that the militia of the neighboring counties
  will be called out by the Governor,<br>to enforce the laws. The treatment of the
  Mormonites is described as extremely<br>outrageous, and they are commended in some
  of the papers of St. Louis for their<br>resistance.<br>"
