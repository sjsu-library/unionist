transcription: "<em>The Mormonites.â€”</em> Some further particulars relating to the
  conflict between the Mormonites and the people of Jackson county in Missouri are
  given in the St. Louis papers. It is said that one Judge of the circuit, and several
  civil officers were thrown into prison in consequence of an attempt to interfere,
  and detained for some hours, and the Lieut. Governor had been driven out of the
  county. Almost all the people of the county are concerned on one side or the other,
  so that it is supposed that the militia of the neighboring counties will be called
  out by the Governor, to enforce the laws. The treatment of the Mormonites is described
  as extremely outrageous, and they are commended in some of the papers of St. Louis
  for their resistance. "
