transcription: We really think the Hartford Times acts much better, the part of a
  <em>discreet</em> friend to Col. Judson, in omitting his Circular, than does the
  Advertiser in publishing and requesting others to publish it.
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: A recognition by Charles Burleigh that Judson's circular does not present
  its author in a good light. History has sustained Burleigh's insight in this regard.
