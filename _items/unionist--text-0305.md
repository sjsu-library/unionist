transcription: "<p>PETER OF RUSSIA</p><p>  We have always thought that Peter the Great
  was more worthy of that epithet,<br>  than any Prince to whose name it has been
  affixed. Peter was a great man. He<br>  was truly GREAT. His intellect was of the
  highest order—and his sole study<br>  through life was to make his subjects wiser
  and happier. He introduced among<br>  barbarians the arts and the courtesies of
  civilized life—and he paved the way<br>  to the grandeur of the Russian Empire.
  His name is never mentioned by a<br>  Russian but with the utmost veneration and
  respect. Peter the Great was a<br>  <em>practical Mechanic.</em>  He was a carpenter
  and a blacksmith—and his tools are not preserved with great<br>  care in the Museum
  of St. Petersburgh, and are pointed out to strangers with<br>  all the marks of
  devotion which are exhibited by good Catholics, when exposing<br>  to the unhallowed
  gaze of heretics, the holiest relics.<br></p><p>  Peter built one of the noblest
  maritime cities in the world, and thither<br>  removed his Court. He introduced
  the European discipline into his armies—and<br>  taught them to fight and conquer.
  He laid the foundation for a navy, and<br>  furnished his artificers with models
  of naval architecture constructed by<br>  himself. He facilitated communication
  through the different parts of his<br>  immense Empire by making public roads, some
  of which were upwards of<br>  <em>one thousand miles in length!</em>  He established
  manufactories of various kinds—the first of which was pins. He<br>  made just laws
  and caused them to be respected.<br></p><p>  But more than all, the Russian women
  have reason to bless the memory of Peter.<br>  Previous to his reign, women in Russia
  were not allowed to sea their intended<br>  husbands until their nuptial day—and
  among the presents which the bridegroom<br>  received from his bride on this important
  occasion was a handful o<br>  rods—intimating that if she should ever conduct improperly,
  she was ready to<br>  submit to marital chastisement. After marriage the husband
  never allowed the<br>  wife to be seated at the same table with him—he could even
  kill her with<br>  impunity. On the other hand, a woman who murdered her husband
  was sentenced to<br>  be buried alive! But Peter, knowing well the humanizing influence
  which woman<br>  exerts over the character o man, caused laws to be enacted in her
  favor—and<br>  raised her from a slave to become the companion of man !”—<br>  <em>Sun</em></p>"

commentary: Peter the Great (1672-1725, r. 1682-1725) did much to bring Russia into
  the orbit of Europe, and built it into an empire
