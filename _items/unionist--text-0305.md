transcription: "<p>PETER OF RUSSIA</p> <p> We have always thought that Peter the Great
  was more worthy of that epithet, than any Prince to whose name it has been affixed.
  Peter was a great man. He was truly GREAT. His intellect was of the highest order—and
  his sole study through life was to make his subjects wiser and happier. He introduced
  among barbarians the arts and the courtesies of civilized life—and he paved the
  way to the grandeur of the Russian Empire. His name is never mentioned by a Russian
  but with the utmost veneration and respect. Peter the Great was a <em>practical
  Mechanic.</em> He was a carpenter and a blacksmith—and his tools are now preserved
  with great care in the Museum of St. Petersburgh, and are pointed out to strangers
  with all the marks of devotion which are exhibited by good Catholics, when exposing
  to the unhallowed gaze of heretics, the holiest relics. </p> <p> Peter built one
  of the noblest maritime cities in the world, and thither removed his Court. He introduced
  the European discipline into his armies—and taught them to fight and conquer. He
  laid the foundation for a navy, and furnished his artificers with models of naval
  architecture constructed by himself. He facilitated communication through the different
  parts of his immense Empire by making public roads, some of which were upwards of
  <em>one thousand miles in length!</em> He established manufactories of various kinds—the
  first of which was pins. He made just laws and caused them to be respected. </p>
  <p> But more than all, the Russian women have reason to bless the memory of Peter.
  Previous to his reign, women in Russia were not allowed to see their intended husbands
  until their nuptial day—and among the presents which the bridegroom received from
  his bride on this important occasion was a handful of rods—intimating that if she
  should ever conduct improperly, she was ready to submit to marital chastisement.
  After marriage the husband never allowed the wife to be seated at the same table
  with him—he could even kill her with impunity. On the other hand, a woman who murdered
  her husband was sentenced to be buried alive! But Peter, knowing well the humanizing
  influence which woman exerts over the character of man, caused laws to be enacted
  in her favor—and raised her from a slave to become the companion of man !”— <em>Sun</em>

commentary: Peter the Great (1672-1725, r. 1682-1725) did much to bring Russia into
  the orbit of Europe, and built it into an empire. Highlighting his liberalization
  of laws related to women is an interesting indication of growing pro-feminist consciousness.
