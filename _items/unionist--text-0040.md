transcription: "<p> “From the Hartford Times!!” <em>The Unionist</em> August 8, 1833,
  1:2:2, column 5 </p> <p>FROM THE HARTFORD TIMES!!</p> <p> We have received the letter
  of Messrs Rufus Adams and Andrew T. Judson relating to the negro school at Canterbury.
  It cannot be doubted that these gentlemen have been much abused and misrepresented;
  [☞] but we believe there are no new facts set forth in this letter requiring its
  publication. [☞] </p> <p>So Mr. Judson has wasted his paper and ink.</p> "
