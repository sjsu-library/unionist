transcription: "“A paper has just been established at Brooklyn, Windham Co. called
  “The Unionist,” by Charles C. Burleigh, Esq. It is a red hot Abolitionist, and its
  columns are filled with the martyrdom of Miss Prudence Crandall. It has much to
  say of Col. Judson’s negro oppression law, Watkins’ cell, &amp;c. &amp;c. Instead
  of Unionist, the paper should have been called Divisionist, Rebellionist, Pull off
  your Hat to the Blackist, and Knock your Teeth down your Throatist; and the editor,
  instead of announcing his name as Chas. Burleigh, should say, “published by Hurly
  Burly, near Canterbury.”"
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: The Columbian Register of New Haven was always a stalwart opponent of
  Black civil rights in the United States. As masters of newspaper sarcasm, the use
  of "Hurly Burly" to describe Charles C. Burleigh is to be expected.
