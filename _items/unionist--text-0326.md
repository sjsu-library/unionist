transcription: "<em>Something extempore from Isaac Hill.</em>—A letter from Washington,
  March 20, says “Among the most extraordinary<br>occurrences that have taken place
  here, that I have heard of, is that of Isaac<br>Hill’s being toasted at a late meeting
  of the Typographical Society, when he<br>rose, and<br><em>pulling a written speech
  from his pocket,</em>he began&nbsp; by reading thus, “Mr. President being unexpectedly
  called upon by<br>the toast just offered, &amp;c.”<br>"
