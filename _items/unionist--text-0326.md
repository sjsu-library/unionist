  <em>Something extempore from Isaac Hill.</em>
  —A letter from Washington, March 20, says “Among the most extraordinary
  occurrences that have taken place here, that I have heard of, is that of Isaac
  Hill’s being toasted at a late meeting of the Typographical Society, when he
  rose, and <em>pulling a written speech from his pocket,</em>
  he began by reading thus, “Mr. President being unexpectedly called upon by
  the toast just offered, &amp;c.”
