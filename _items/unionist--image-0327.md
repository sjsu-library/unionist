caption: Indeed - this was not going to end slavery. Tom Shick's scholarly article
  presents many perspectives on the American Colonization Society's work in Liberia.
  None of them are positive or rosy. See Shick, Tom W. “A Quantitative Analysis of
  Liberian Colonization from 1820 to 1843 with Special Reference to Mortality.” The
  Journal of African History, vol. 12, no. 1, 1971, pp. 45–59. JSTOR, http://www.jstor.org/stable/180566.
