transcription: "<p>   “We have copied on our last page, from the Brooklyn (Conn.)
  Unionist, a report   of the trial of Miss Crandall with the charge of Judge Daggett.
  It will be   seen that Judge D. has given it as his opinion, that no colored man
  is a   citizen of the United States. This opinion, we are sure, will be viewed with
  \  astonishment in many parts of the Union. In Massachusetts, the constitution   and
  laws have never deprived any man of any privilege on account of the color   of his
  skin. The black man there votes, buys and sells real estate, and is   eligible to
  the office of Judge, Senator, or Governor. The same is true of   Maine, and we believe
  also of Vermont, New Hampshire, and several other   States. In Connecticut and New
  York, it is true, the laws are not equally   creditable to the humanity and republicanism
  of the people; and in most of the   states farther south, there are distinctions
  between different classes of the   population still more opposed to sound moral
  and political principle, but we   believe that Judge D. is the first judge in the
  United States who has   officially expressed the opinion, that free colored men
  are not citizens. We   cannot believe that this is sound law, and we are supported
  in this belief by   some of the ablest jurists in our country, whose opinions we
  quote below. </p> <p>   While we are on this subject we must caution our foreign
  friends not to make   too wide an application of the censure which they may found
  on the proceedings   in the case of Miss Crandall. So far as we have noticed, those
  proceedings,   beyond the limits of Connecticut, are everywhere viewed with marked
  \  disapprobation. We regard them as the offspring of a delusion similar to that
  \  which pervades Georgia in relation to the Cherokees. It is local, and we trust
  \  it will be temporary. </p> <p>   The opinions of the jurists referred to above,
  are contained in the following   extracts from “Reports of the proceedings and debates
  of the Convention of   1821, assembled for the purpose of amending the Constitution
  of the State of   New-York.” The extracts were made by Judge W. Jay, of Bedford.”

commentary: Noteworthy here in the commentary is the idea that the rest of the nation
  is stunned by the behavior of the white Canterburians
