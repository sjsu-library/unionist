transcription: "<p>  “We have copied on our last page, from the Brooklyn (Conn.) Unionist,
  a report<br>  of the trial of Miss Crandall with the charge of Judge Daggett. It
  will be<br>  seen that Judge D. has given it as his opinion, that no colored man
  is a<br>  citizen of the United States. This opinion, we are sure, will be viewed
  with<br>  astonishment in many parts of the Union. In Massachusetts, the constitution<br>
  \ and laws have never deprived any man of any privilege on account of the color<br>
  \ of his skin. The black man there votes, buys and sells real estate, and is<br>
  \ eligible to the office of Judge, Senator, or Governor. The same is true of<br>
  \ Maine, and we believe also of Vermont, New Hampshire, and several other<br>  States.
  In Connecticut and New York, it is true, the laws are not equally<br>  creditable
  to the humanity and republicanism of the people; and in most of the<br>  states
  farther south, there are distinctions between different classes of the<br>  population
  still more opposed to sound moral and political principle, but we<br>  believe that
  Judge D. is the first judge in the United States who has<br>  officially expressed
  the opinion, that free colored men are not citizens. We<br>  cannot believe that
  this is sound law, and we are supported in this belief by<br>  some of the ablest
  jurists in our country, whose opinions we quote below.<br></p><p>  While we are
  on this subject we must caution our foreign friends not to make<br>  too wide an
  application of the censure which they may found on the proceedings<br>  in the case
  of Miss Crandall. So far as we have noticed, those proceedings,<br>  beyond the
  limits of Connecticut, are everywhere viewed with marked<br>  disapprobation. We
  regard them as the offspring of a delusion similar to that<br>  which pervades Georgia
  in relation to the Cherokees. It is local, and we trust<br>  it will be temporary.<br></p><p>
  \ The opinions of the jurists referred to above, are contained in the following<br>
  \ extracts from “Reports of the proceedings and debates of the Convention of<br>
  \ 1821, assembled for the purpose of amending the Constitution of the State of<br>
  \ New-York.” The extracts were made by Judge W. Jay, of Bedford.”<br></p>"

commentary: Noteworthy here in the commentary is the idea that the rest of the nation
  is stunned by the behavior of the white Canterburians
