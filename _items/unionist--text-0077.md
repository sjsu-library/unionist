  CATHEDRAL—STONEHENGE—THE SHEPHERD OF SALISBURY PLAIN<br></p><p align="right">  <em>Salisbury,
  July</em>  2, 1833.<br></p><p>  The shepherd of Salisbury Plain, Stonehenge, Old
  Sarum, and Salisbury<br>  Cathedral are things of some note. The latter is distinguished
  for its lofty<br>  spire, four hundred feet; for the purity and uniformity of its
  architecture,<br>  external and internal; and for the warped condition of the columns
  of masonry,<br>  which support the tower and spire, under the amazing weight that
  rests upon<br>  them, and then look us and observe [indecipherable] ready to be
  crushed. And<br>  the only reason why it is presumed they will remain, is because
  they have<br>  already endured for ages under the same appearances. An extra fixture
  has been<br>  thrown in for protection, interposing a monstrous blemish in the perspective<br>  of
  the transept. Aside from this the pure Gothic of the entire edifice,<br>  constitutes
  the rarest beauty of the kind in the British Isles. It was built<br>  in the thirteenth
  century—the spire having been since added, the top of which<br>  inclines 22 inches
  from a perpendicular line, in consequence of the warping of<br>  its supports. An
  old man now between seventy and eighty, has been accustomed<br>  to ascend once
  in a twelve month for many years to oil the weather vane. He<br>  gets out at a
  window a few feet below the top, scrambles like a squirrel by<br>  some iron net
  work at the giddy elevation of four hundred feet, performs his<br>  office, and
  descends with all the self-possession of a sailor. This year,<br>  however, he has
  been unable to do his duty on account of the infirmities of<br>  age.<br></p><p>  I
  rode this morning in a fly, a sort of hackney-coach, drawn by a couple of<br>  mules,
  to<br>  <em>Stonehenge,</em>  about eight miles from the town, situated in the heart
  of Salisbury plain, and<br>  standing insolated in all the grandeur of its mysterious
  and hitherto<br>  unexplained history. It is a truly sublime object—sublime in itself,
  as<br>  filling the mind with wonder, where the stones came from, how they could
  have<br>  been brought there, and placed in their relative positions! The heaviest<br>  columns
  are rated at seventy tons—the whole number being ninety-four, as near<br>  as can
  be ascertained, although the present confusion of the assemblage<br>  renders it
  difficult to count them. It is supposed to have been a Druidical<br>  temple, where
  human sacrifices were offered—a superstition as sublime as it<br>  was diabolical,
  as mysterious as cruel! The rude grandeur of the work<br>  demonstrates the barbarity
  of the age. There are no indications, that this<br>  place of sacrifice was ever
  enclosed by walls, or covered by a roof. It is<br>  encircled indeed by the traces
  of a ditch and a corresponding embankment, and<br>  the columnar ranges of stones
  were set up in circular lines, at greater<br>  distance from each other than the
  space occupied. About half an acre is<br>  enclosed by the circumvallation, and
  a quarter of an acre occupied by the<br>  temple itself. The only junction of the
  structure if structure it can be<br>  called, appears to have been the resting of
  the amazing cross and horizontal<br>  slabs on the largest columns, about 20 ft.
  high &amp; 15 asunder, most of<br>  which have fallen, some are inclined, and a
  few only standing erect. Tenons<br>  were left on the top of the perpendicular columns,
  entering grooves of the<br>  horizontal pieces laid upon them. It is barely possible,
  that the mechanical<br>  powers of the present age could set up an edifice like
  this; but the rudeness<br>  of the work does not naturally suggest the knowledge
  and application of such<br>  powers at the time of its creation. Hence the wonder.<br></p><p>  It
  is said by some, that the same material is not to be found in this island.<br>  It
  is incredible, however, that these immense rocks should have been shipped;<br>  and
  almost equally incredible, that they should have been transported any<br>  considerable
  distance on trundles; and yet they were never found in this<br>  vicinity. Many
  of them are reduced to nearly right angles, but more exhibit a<br>  smooth, or properly
  plane surface. There is nothing like the skill of masonry<br>  bestowed upon them.
  They are perhaps purposely left in this rude state, as<br>  emblematic of the stern
  and inexorable rites which they were set up to<br>  witness. The supposed altar
  piece lies in the centre, embedded in the earth,<br>  and directly behind it two
  of the largest columns supported the heaviest<br>  cross-beam—but the columns have
  inclined and dropped their burden.<br></p><p>  There are other relics of the kind
  in the island, but none so stupendous. All<br>  the parts of a similar temple have
  been transferred at great expense from the<br>  island of Jersey, and set up on
  the estate of a private gentleman at<br>  Henley-on-Thames, now the property of
  a Mr. Maitland. I stumbled upon it the<br>  other day in rambling over the grounds
  with a friend, and found it perched on<br>  a hill some four or five hundred feet
  above the bed of the Thames. It was<br>  brought over by a former governor of the
  island, Gen. Conway, who then owned<br>  Park-place, on which it now stands. It
  is of course a small chapel, compared<br>  with<br>  <em>Stonehenge</em>  on Salisbury
  Plain—but many of the stones are of several tons weight. They are<br>  rude and
  shapeless.<br></p><p>  There are numerous marks of ancient military fortifications,
  scattered over<br>  Salisbury Plain; and tumuli of the ancient dead, such as are
  to be found in<br>  the Western regions of our own country, lift up their heads
  in various<br>  quarters, and sometimes in groups.<br></p><p>  Old Sarum, of recent
  fame, as a rotten borough of England, sending two members<br>  to Parliament under
  the late<br>  <em>regime</em>  , is a naked fortification in ruins, two miles from
  Salisbury. It is as<br>  desolate as the crown of Ben Nevis in Scotland.<br></p><p>  My
  sensations in visiting Stonehenge were the result of a singular combination<br>  of
  the grateful recollections of Mrs. More’s Shepherd and his family, and of<br>  the
  actual scenes before me. “The Shepherd of Salisbury Plain” was continually<br>  ringing
  in my ear, and all his history passing before me, as I rode over these<br>  undulating,
  naked, and apparently boundless fields, among the tumuli and<br>  traces of ancient
  fortifications, and came at last to gaze upon and admire<br>  this wonder-exciting
  and unaccountable relic of a barbarous age and bloody<br>  superstition. What a
  demonstration of man’s susceptibilities of religious<br>  affections, of a sense
  of guilt, of his need of atonement, and of the dreadful<br>  errors, into which
  he may be plunged without the guidance of a divine<br>  revelation!<br></p>
scholarlyNotes: 'An unusual decision, for page one at the time of the trial. '
commentary: 'While it is interesting that this occupies part of page one, in the very
  midst of the trial over the Black Law, the discussion about religious sensibilities
  in this reflective travelogue certainly speaks to the Romantic spirit, and the emergence
  in New England of Emersonian Transcendentalism at this same time. Hannah More (1745-1833),
  the author of <em>The Sheperd of Salisbury Plain</em>, was an important female voice
  on the literature of the time, though not well-known today. '
