    SALISBURY CATHEDRAL—STONEHENGE—THE SHEPHERD OF SALISBURY PLAIN
  </p>
  <p align="right">
    <em>Salisbury, July</em>
    2, 1833.
  </p>
  <p>
    The shepherd of Salisbury Plain, Stonehenge, Old Sarum, and Salisbury
    Cathedral are things of some note. The latter is distinguished for its lofty
    spire, four hundred feet; for the purity and uniformity of its architecture,
    external and internal; and for the warped condition of the columns of masonry,
    which support the tower and spire, under the amazing weight that rests upon
    them, and then look us and observe [indecipherable] ready to be crushed. And
    the only reason why it is presumed they will remain, is because they have
    already endured for ages under the same appearances. An extra fixture has been
    thrown in for protection, interposing a monstrous blemish in the perspective
    of the transept. Aside from this the pure Gothic of the entire edifice,
    constitutes the rarest beauty of the kind in the British Isles. It was built
    in the thirteenth century—the spire having been since added, the top of which
    inclines 22 inches from a perpendicular line, in consequence of the warping of
    its supports. An old man now between seventy and eighty, has been accustomed
    to ascend once in a twelve month for many years to oil the weather vane. He
    gets out at a window a few feet below the top, scrambles like a squirrel by
    some iron net work at the giddy elevation of four hundred feet, performs his
    office, and descends with all the self-possession of a sailor. This year,
    however, he has been unable to do his duty on account of the infirmities of
    age.

    I rode this morning in a fly, a sort of hackney-coach, drawn by a couple of
    mules, to
    <em>Stonehenge,</em>
    about eight miles from the town, situated in the heart of Salisbury plain, and
    standing insolated in all the grandeur of its mysterious and hitherto
    unexplained history. It is a truly sublime object—sublime in itself, as
    filling the mind with wonder, where the stones came from, how they could have
    been brought there, and placed in their relative positions! The heaviest
    columns are rated at seventy tons—the whole number being ninety-four, as near
    as can be ascertained, although the present confusion of the assemblage
    renders it difficult to count them. It is supposed to have been a Druidical
    temple, where human sacrifices were offered—a superstition as sublime as it
    was diabolical, as mysterious as cruel! The rude grandeur of the work
    demonstrates the barbarity of the age. There are no indications, that this
    place of sacrifice was ever enclosed by walls, or covered by a roof. It is
    encircled indeed by the traces of a ditch and a corresponding embankment, and
    the columnar ranges of stones were set up in circular lines, at greater
    distance from each other than the space occupied. About half an acre is
    enclosed by the circumvallation, and a quarter of an acre occupied by the
    temple itself. The only junction of the structure if structure it can be
    called, appears to have been the resting of the amazing cross and horizontal
    slabs on the largest columns, about 20 ft. high &amp; 15 asunder, most of
    which have fallen, some are inclined, and a few only standing erect. Tenons
    were left on the top of the perpendicular columns, entering grooves of the
    horizontal pieces laid upon them. It is barely possible, that the mechanical
    powers of the present age could set up an edifice like this; but the rudeness
    of the work does not naturally suggest the knowledge and application of such
    powers at the time of its creation. Hence the wonder.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is said by some, that the same material is not to be found in this island.
    It is incredible, however, that these immense rocks should have been shipped;
    and almost equally incredible, that they should have been transported any
    considerable distance on trundles; and yet they were never found in this
    vicinity. Many of them are reduced to nearly right angles, but more exhibit a
    smooth, or properly plane surface. There is nothing like the skill of masonry
    bestowed upon them. They are perhaps purposely left in this rude state, as
    emblematic of the stern and inexorable rites which they were set up to
    witness. The supposed altar piece lies in the centre, embedded in the earth,
    and directly behind it two of the largest columns supported the heaviest
    cross-beam—but the columns have inclined and dropped their burden.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are other relics of the kind in the island, but none so stupendous. All
    the parts of a similar temple have been transferred at great expense from the
    island of Jersey, and set up on the estate of a private gentleman at
    Henley-on-Thames, now the property of a Mr. Maitland. I stumbled upon it the
    other day in rambling over the grounds with a friend, and found it perched on
    a hill some four or five hundred feet above the bed of the Thames. It was
    brought over by a former governor of the island, Gen. Conway, who then owned
    Park-place, on which it now stands. It is of course a small chapel, compared
    with
    <em>Stonehenge</em>
    on Salisbury Plain—but many of the stones are of several tons weight. They are
    rude and shapeless.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are numerous marks of ancient military fortifications, scattered over
    Salisbury Plain; and tumuli of the ancient dead, such as are to be found in
    the Western regions of our own country, lift up their heads in various
    quarters, and sometimes in groups.
  </p>
  <p>
    Old Sarum, of recent fame, as a rotten borough of England, sending two members
    to Parliament under the late
    <em>regime</em>
    , is a naked fortification in ruins, two miles from Salisbury. It is as
    desolate as the crown of Ben Nevis in Scotland.
  </p>
  <p>
    My sensations in visiting Stonehenge were the result of a singular combination
    of the grateful recollections of Mrs. More’s Shepherd and his family, and of
    the actual scenes before me. “The Shepherd of Salisbury Plain” was continually
    ringing in my ear, and all his history passing before me, as I rode over these
    undulating, naked, and apparently boundless fields, among the tumuli and
    traces of ancient fortifications, and came at last to gaze upon and admire
    this wonder-exciting and unaccountable relic of a barbarous age and bloody
    superstition. What a demonstration of man’s susceptibilities of religious
    affections, of a sense of guilt, of his need of atonement, and of the dreadful
    errors, into which he may be plunged without the guidance of a divine
    revelation!

scholarlyNotes: 'An unusual decision, for page one at the time of the trial. '
commentary: 'While it is interesting that this occupies part of page one, in the very
  midst of the trial over the Black Law, the discussion about religious sensibilities
  in this reflective travelogue certainly speaks to the Romantic spirit, and the emergence
  in New England of Emersonian Transcendentalism at this same time. Hannah More (1745-1833),
  the author of <em>The Sheperd of Salisbury Plain</em>, was an important female voice
  in English-language literature of the time, though not well-known today. '
