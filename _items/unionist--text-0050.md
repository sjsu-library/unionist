transcription: 'If the provisions of this law can be reconciled with the nature of
  our government, or the principles of common justice, we greatly mistake its character.
  We know not on what grounds the distinction which it makes can be justified. Why
  should one portion of our community be deprived of privileges enjoyed by others,
  merely on account of a difference of complexion? If there is any good reason for
  the restrictions embraced in the law, let them at least extend to schools and seminaries
  of every description; let all fare alike, the white as well as the black. But let
  not the latter be visited with pains and penalties while the former are exempt.
  As to the clamor which is raised about the fanaticism of those who are friendly
  to the instruction of the blacks, or the sneers and censures so liberally bestowed
  upon Miss Crandall, they cannot, even if well founded, alter the character of the
  law. The correctness of their view, and the expediency of their measures, are different
  questions from the justice of the law by which it is proposed to counteract them.
  The indiscretion of individuals, allowing them to exist, are no justification of
  a legal enactment unequal, oppressive and wrong in its provisions, and at war with
  the genius of our republican institutions. In some of the papers from the slave
  states, the law as was to be expected, is commended; it is seen to be in accordance
  with the rigorous measures adopted under a system of slavery—but in other sections
  of our country, it is strongly condemned, and regarded as a shame and reproach to
  our state.” – <em>Connecticut Courant</em> '
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: The Connecticut Courant was arguably the flagship newspaper of the state,
  so its support for the cause of Crandall was signficant.
