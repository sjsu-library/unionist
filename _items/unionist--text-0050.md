transcription: If the provisions of this law can be reconciled with the nature of
  our <br>government, or the principles of common justice, we greatly mistake its
  <br>character. We know not on what grounds the distinction which it makes can be
  <br>justified. Why should one portion of our community be deprived of privileges
  <br>enjoyed by others, merely on account of a difference of complexion? If there
  is <br>any good reason for the restrictions embraced in the law, let them at least
  <br>extend to schools and seminaries of every description; let all fare alike, the
  <br>white as well as the black. But let not the latter be visited with pains and
  <br>penalties while the former are exempt. As to the clamor which is raised about
  <br>the fanaticism of those who are friendly to the instruction of the blacks, or
  <br>the sneers and censures so liberally bestowed upon Miss Crandall, they cannot,
  <br>even if well founded, alter the character of the law. The correctness of their
  <br>view, and the expediency of their measures, are different questions from the
  <br>justice of the law by which it is proposed to counteract them. The indiscretion
  <br>of individuals, allowing them to exist, are no justification of a legal <br>enactment
  unequal, oppressive and wrong in its provisions, and at war with the <br>genius
  of our republican institutions. In some of the papers from the slave <br>states,
  the law as was to be expected, is commended; it is seen to be in <br>accordance
  with the rigorous measures adopted under a system of slavery—but in <br>other sections
  of our country, it is strongly condemned, and regarded as a shame <br>and reproach
  to our state.” – <br><em>Connecticut Courant</em>
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: The Connecticut Courant was arguably the flagship newspaper of the state,
  so its support for the cause of Crandall was signficant.
