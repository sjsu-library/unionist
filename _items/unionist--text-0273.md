  a petition<br>  to the Hon. General Assembly of the State of Connecticut to be convened
  at New<br>  Haven on the first Wednesday in May next, praying said Assembly to appoint
  a<br>  Committee to lay out a Turnpike road, beginning near the Post Office in<br>

  \ way to the gap or notch in Bolton mountain (so called) intersecting the Boston<br>
  \ Turnpike road near said notch in said mountain, and make return of their<br>  doings
  to said Assembly. And also praying said Assembly to incorporate said<br>  Witter
  and his associates into a Turnpike Company for the purpose of making<br>  and keeping
  said proposed road in repair as by said petition will appear. All<br>  persons concerned
  are notified to appear before said Assembly as the law<br>  directs, then and there
