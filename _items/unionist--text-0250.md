transcription: "<em>Mr. Pearl.</em>—We again avert to this gentleman, that we may
  correct an erroneous impression<br>that has gone abroad, induced by an article in
  our paper of week before last, in<br>which we alluded to his nomination for Senator.
  A meaning was attached to our<br>remarks by some, which we never intended should
  be and never thought would be<br>attached to them—namely, that because Mr. Pearl
  is a farmer, and not a<br>professional man, he is therefore unqualified for the
  office to which he is<br>nominated. Nothing could be farther from our intention
  than to convey such an<br>idea. Till within a few years we were ourself a farmer,
  and from a more intimate<br>acquaintance with that class of working-men than with
  any other, we take the<br>most lively interest in every thing calculated to promote
  their political or<br>moral welfare. We are not opposed to Mr. Pearl because he
  is not a professional<br>man, but because we believe him opposed to some of those
  eternal principles of<br>right which are to us dear as the apple of our eye, and
  which we feel ourself<br>solemnly pledged to defend according to the best of our
  feeble abilities. For<br>Mr. Pearl’s private character we entertain the most unfeigned
  respect—but while<br>we believe him pursuing a political course which we consider
  detrimental to our<br>dearest interests as a people, we must, if we would be honest,
  most strenuously<br>oppose his political elevation.”<br>"
scholarlyNotes: Feb 27 1834 Unionist had something opposed to Pearl's candidacy
commentary: Because the author identifies himself as a farmer, I have defaulted to
  giving authorship here to Charles Burleigh
