transcription: "<p>CIRCULAR</p> <p><em>TO PARENTS, TEACHERS, SCHOOL COMMITTEES,</em></p>
  <p><em>And all who feel an Interest in the Improvement of Youth.</em></p> <p> It
  is not yet quite a year since Parley’s Magazine was commenced. During that short
  period the number of subscribers has increased to 20,000, and the work has received,
  every where, the most unqualified approbation. It has found its way to thousands
  of families, and while it has entertained the social circle, its unobtrusive lessons
  have, we trust, often had a <em>salutary influence</em> on the <em>juvenile mind</em>
  and <em>heart.</em> It has also found its way to the school room; and many classes
  of young pupils have been cheered twice a month by the welcome voice of their teacher
  bidding them to lay aside for a few days, the class book which they have read over
  and over, perhaps twenty times, and read the pages of Parley’s Magazine. The demand
  for the work, to be used in schools, is rapidly increasing. </p> <p> Encouraged
  by such unexampled success, the Publishers have resolved to render it still more
  worthy so liberal a patronage; and not to remit their exertions till they see it
  introduced into families and schools, throughout the whole length and breadth of
  the United States. </p> <p> In this view they have secured new aid in the Editorial
  department. The late Editor of the Juvenile Rambler, who, in addition to his qualifications
  as a writer for the young, has the advantage of many years experience as a teacher,
  will henceforth assist in conducting it. </p> <p> We propose to present, in the
  progress of each volume, a great variety of interesting and important topics, among
  which are the following. </p> <p> I.Natural History—Of beasts, birds, fishes, reptiles,
  insects; plants, flowers, trees; the human frame, &amp;c. </p> <p>II.Biography—Especially
  of the young.</p> <p>III.Geography—Accounts of places, manners, customs, etc.</p>
  <p>IV.Travels and Voyages, in various parts of the world.</p> <p> V.Lively Descriptions
  of the Curiosities of <em>Nature</em> and <em>Art—</em> in each of the United States,
  and in other countries. </p> <p> VI.Lessons on Objects that daily surround Children
  in the Parlor, Nursery, Garden, etc. Accounts of Trades and Employments. </p> <p>
  VII.Particular Duties of the Young—to Parents, Teachers, Brothers, Sisters, etc.
  </p> <p>VIII.Bible Lessons and Stories</p> <p>IX.Narratives—Such as are well authenticated—Original
  Tales</p> <p> X.Parables, Fables, and Proverbs, where the moral is obvious and excellent.
  </p> <p>XI.Poetry—Adapted to the Youthful capacity and feelings.</p> <p> XII.Intelligence—Embracing
  Accounts of Juvenile <em>Books</em>, Societies, and <em>Remarkable Occurrences.</em>
  </p> <p> Many of these subjects will be illustrated by numerous and beautiful engravings,
  prepared by the best artists , and selected not only with a view to <em>adorn</em>
  the work, but to improve the taste, cultivate the mind, and raise the affections
  of the young to appropriate and worthy objects. We would make them better brothers,
  better sisters, better pupils, better associates, and, in the end, better citizens.
  </p> <p> We beg the friends of education—especially parents and teachers, to view
  the matter in this fight. Let children look upon the pictures, not as pictures <em>merely;</em>
  but let them be taught to <em>study</em> them. What can be more rich in valuable
  materials for instructive lessons than a good engraving? </p> <p> After this brief
  explanation of our principles and purposes, we ask the co-operation of all who receive
  this Circular. Will you aid us, by your influence, in this great work—the formation
  of mind and character for the rising generation? Will you assist us all in your
  power, in our endeavors to introduce to American schools, and parlors, and firesides,
  the stories and lessons of Parley’s Magazine? </p> <p> Every single number of the
  new volume will have a strong paper cover, abundantly sufficient to preserve the
  work in good order for binding and for use in schools. </p> <p> The yearly subscription
  being but one <em>dollar</em>, our friends will perceive the impracticability of
  keeping open so many thousand accounts. It is therefore indispensable that we should
  require payment always in advance. </p> <p> Two numbers more will close the first
  year, and we now give this notice that all who desire to continue the Magazine,
  may signify their intention by a seasonable advance for the second year. </p> <p>
  In any of the subscribers should not receive all their numbers, they can request
  the Post-Master to notify us of such as are missing, and they shall be sent again
  free of charge. </p> <p>TEN COPIES FREE OF POSTAGE.</p> <p> To accommodate ASSOCIATIONS,
  SCHOOLS, and INDIVIDUALS, for distributions, we will deliver at any Post-Office
  in the United States, <em>free of postage,</em> TEN COPIES TO ONE ADDRESS for TEN
  dollars remitted to us without cost. </p> <p>LILLY, WATT, and CO., Boston</p> <p></p> "
