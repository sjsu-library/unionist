transcription: "<p>CIRCULAR</p><p><em>TO PARENTS, TEACHERS, SCHOOL COMMITTEES,</em></p><p><em>And
  all who feel an Interest in the Improvement of Youth.</em></p><p>  It is not yet
  quite a year since Parley’s Magazine was commenced. During that <br>  short period
  the number of subscribers has increased to 20,000, and the work <br>  has received,
  every where, the most unqualified approbation. It has found its <br>  way to thousands
  of families, and while it has entertained the social circle, <br>  its unobtrusive
  lessons have, we trust, often had a <br>  <em>salutary influence</em>  on the <br>
  \ <em>juvenile mind</em>  and <br>  <em>heart.</em>  It has also found its way to
  the school room; and many classes of young pupils <br>  have been cheered twice
  a month&nbsp; y the welcome voice of their teacher <br>  bidding them to lay aside
  for a few days, the class book which they have read <br>  over and over, perhaps
  twenty times, and read the pages of Parley’s Magazine. <br>  The demand for the
  work, to be used in schools, is rapidly increasing. <br></p><p>  Encouraged by such
  unexampled success, the Publishers have resolved to render <br>  it still more worthy
  so liberal a patronage; and not to remit their exertions <br>  till they see it
  introduced into families and schools, throughout the whole <br>  length and breadth
  of the United States. <br></p><p>  In this view they have secured new aid in the
  Editorial department. The late <br>  Editor of the Juvenile Rambler, who, in addition
  to his qualifications as a <br>  writer for the young, has the advantage of many
  years experience as a teacher, <br>  will henceforth assist in conducting it. <br></p><p>
  \ We propose to present, in the progress of each volume, a great variety of <br>
  \ interesting and important topics, among which are the following. <br></p><p>  I.Natural
  History—Of beasts, birds, fishes, reptiles, insects; plants, <br>  flowers, trees;
  the human frame, &amp;c. <br></p><p>II.Biography—Especially of the young.</p><p>III.Geography—Accounts
  of places, manners, customs, etc.</p><p>IV.Travels and Voyages, in various parts
  of the world.</p><p>  V.Lively Descriptions of the Curiosities of <br>  <em>Nature</em>
  \ and <br>  <em>Art—</em>  in each of the United States, and in other countries.
  <br></p><p>  VI.Lessons on Objects that daily surround Children in the Parlor, Nursery,
  <br>  Garden, etc. Accounts of Trades and Employments. <br></p><p>  VII.Particular
  Duties of the Young—to Parents, Teachers, Brothers, Sisters, <br>  etc. <br></p><p>VIII.Bible
  Lessons and Stories</p><p>IX.Narratives—Such as are well authenticated—Original
  Tales</p><p>  X.Parables, Fables, and Proverbs, where the moral is obvious and excellent.
  <br></p><p>XI.Poetry—Adapted to the Youthful capacity and feelings.</p><p>  XII.Intelligence—Embracing
  Accounts of Juvenile <br>  <em>Books</em>  Societies, and <br>  <em>Remarkable Occurrences.</em></p><p>
  \ Many of these subjects will be illustrated by numerous and beautiful <br>  engravings,
  prepared by the best artists , and selected not only with a view <br>  to <br>  <em>adorn</em>
  \ the work, but to improve the taste, cultivate the mind, and raise the <br>  affections
  of the young to appropriate and worthy objects. We would make them <br>  better
  brothers, better sisters, better pupils, better associates, and, in the <br>  end,
  better citizens. <br></p><p>  We beg the friends of education—especially parents
  and teachers, to view the <br>  matter in this fight. Let children look upon the
  pictures, not as pictures <br>  <em>merely;</em>  but let them be taught to <br>
  \ <em>study</em>  them. What can be more rich in valuable materials for instructive
  lessons than <br>  a good engraving? <br></p><p>  After this brief explanation of
  our principles and purposes, we ask the <br>  co-operation of all who receive this
  Circular. Will you aid us, by your <br>  influence, in this great work—the formation
  of mind and character for the <br>  rising generation? Will you assist us all in
  your power, in our endeavors to <br>  introduce to American schools, and parlors,
  and firesides, the stories and <br>  lessons of Parley’s Magazine? <br></p><p>  Every
  single number of the new volume will have a strong paper cover, <br>  abundantly
  sufficient to preserve the work in good order for binding and for <br>  use in schools.
  <br></p><p>  The yearly subscription being but one <br>  <em>dollar</em>  , our
  friends will perceive the impracticability of keeping open so many <br>  thousand
  accounts. It is therefore indispensable that we should require <br>  payment always
  in advance. <br></p><p>  Two numbers more will close the first year, and we now
  give this notice that <br>  all who desire to continue the Magazine, may signify
  their intention by a <br>  seasonable advance for the second year. <br></p><p>  In
  any of the subscribers should not receive all their numbers, they can <br>  request
  the Post-Master to notify us of such as are missing, and they shall be <br>  sent
  again free of charge. <br></p><p>TEN COPIES FREE OF POSTAGE.</p><p>  To accommodate
  ASSOCIATIONS, SCHOOLS, and INDIVIDUALS, for distributions, we <br>  will deliver
  at any Post-Office in the United States, <br>  <em>free of postage,</em>  TEN COPIES
  TO ONE ADDRESS for TEN dollars remitted to us without cost. <br></p><p>LILLY, WATT,
  and CO., Boston</p><p></p>"
