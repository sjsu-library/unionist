transcription: "<em>Murder.</em> —An atrocious murder was committed on the body of
  Mr. Ariel Winchell, by his father John Winchell, at Suffield Con. on Monday evening
  last. They had been at variance for several years in relation to the transfer of
  property between them. About sunset on Monday last, as Ariel was tending a coal
  pit, about a mile and a half from his house, his father approached him with a pistol
  and shot him. The ball entered the lower part of the abdomen in front, and rested
  against the spine. The event of course created great sensation, in a short time
  the citizens generally of Suffield were in pursuit. It is scarcely possible that
  the murderer can escape.— <em>Springfield Jour.</em> "
