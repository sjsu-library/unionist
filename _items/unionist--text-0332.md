transcription: "<em>Murder.</em>—An atrocious murder was committed on the body of
  Mr. Ariel Winchell, by his<br>father John Winchell, at Suffield Con. on Monday evening
  last. They had been at<br>variance for several years in relation to the transfer
  of property between them.<br>About sunset on Monday last, as Ariel was tending a
  coal pit, about a mile and a<br>half from his house, his father approached him with
  a pistol and shot him. The<br>ball entered the lower part of the abdomen in front,
  and rested against the<br>spine. The event of course created great sensation, in
  a short time the citizens<br>generally of Suffield were in pursuit. It is scarcely
  possible that the murderer<br>can escape.—<br><em>Springfield Jour.</em>"
