transcription: "<p>   <em>Distressing.</em>   â€”The Rochester Daily Advertiser, relates
  that on the evening of the 28   <sup>th</sup>   ult. the house of Mr. Wm. Irvine,
  in Ulster county, was consumed by fire, with   all if contents, and three children,
  sons of Mr. I. from six to twelve years   of age, perished in the flames. The fire
  broke out after the family had   retired to bed, and made such progress before it
  was discovered, that nothing   could be saved from the house, and even the [indecipherable]
  appeared lying by   the bed sides. How it originated is not known, but it took in
  the second story   where the children were sleeping; there were four of them; they
  were all   awakened by the flames, and some of them started for the window, but
  only the   eldest, a lad of 14 about reached it and leaped out; his brothers did
  not   follow, and were lost. Their remains were found the next day in the ruins.
  \  Besides the loss to Mr. Irvine of his children, he has been entirely stripped
  \  of his effects, and has a daughter who escaped from the flames with simply a
  \  blanket around her in very feeble health. </p> <p>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
