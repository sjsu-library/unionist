transcription: "<p>  <em>Distressing.</em>  â€”The Rochester Daily Advertiser, relates
  that on the evening of the 28<br>  <sup>th</sup>  ult. the house of Mr. Wm. Irvine,
  in Ulster county, was consumed by fire, with<br>  all if contents, and three children,
  sons of Mr. I. from six to twelve years<br>  of age, perished in the flames. The
  fire broke out after the family had<br>  retired to bed, and made such progress
  before it was discovered, that nothing<br>  could be saved from the house, and even
  the [indecipherable] appeared lying by<br>  the bed sides. How it originated is
  not known, but it took in the second story<br>  where the children were sleeping;
  there were four of them; they were all<br>  awakened by the flames, and some of
  them started for the window, but only the<br>  eldest, a lad of 14 about reached
  it and leaped out; his brothers did not<br>  follow, and were lost. Their remains
  were found the next day in the ruins.<br>  Besides the loss to Mr. Irvine of his
  children, he has been entirely stripped<br>  of his effects, and has a daughter
  who escaped from the flames with simply a<br>  blanket around her in very feeble
  health.<br></p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
