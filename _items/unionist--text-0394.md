transcription: "“The editor of the “Unionist” must bear the disappointment with pious
  resignation. His good intentions towards us are duly appreciated—but he has failed
  of his object entirely. We cannot, particularly with the thermometer at 95, be drawn
  into a controversy with <em>him</em> on the subject of anti-ism. We have asserted
  nothing of that pestilent doctrine which is not abundantly borne out by facts—besides,
  any thing about “falsehood and ignorance” comes with a very ill grace from that
  quarter. We shall have Satan, by and bye, ringing the parish bell and reproving
  sin with as much zeal as if he had no part nor lot in the matter.” "
