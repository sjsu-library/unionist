transcription: '<p align="center">THE PEOPLE’S MAGAZINE</p> <p>   THIS work is published
  twice a month, &amp; is furnished to subscribers at $1   a year. It contains a large
  mass of information, and is designed as an amusing   and instructive miscellany
  for families. Each number is illustrated by a   number of beautiful engravings on
  wood, illustrative of some object of   interest, some incident in history, or some
  scene described in the work. The   publishers have the satisfaction to state that
  the number of subscribers is   now about 15,000; and while about 200 journals in
  the United States have   expressed their approbation of it, we know of no instance
  in which an   unfavorable opinion has been expressed. </p> <p>   We state these
  circumstances, in the hope of extending the interest in a work,   which is calculated
  to be of extensive utility. It is among the cheapest   periodicals of the United
  States. </p> <p>   The price of this Magazine is one dollar a year—six copies for
  $5—20 copies   for fifteen dollars—or twenty-five quarterly parts for five dollars.
  Payment   in all cases to be made in advance. </p> <p>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Nov.   27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   18

scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: "<em>The People's Magazine</em> was a family-oriented bi-weekly magazine
  that featured stories of distant, exotic, and interesting places, animals, and people.
  It was especially prized for its engravings. It began publication in 1833. Unlike
  many of the periodicals that advertised in <em>The Unionist</em>, it took no political
  or philosophic positions, even implicitly, on slavery."
