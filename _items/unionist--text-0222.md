transcription: <p align="center">THE PEOPLE’S MAGAZINE</p><p>  THIS work is published
  twice a month, &amp; is furnished to subscribers at $1<br>  a year. It contains
  a large mass of information, and is designed as an amusing<br>  and instructive
  miscellany for families. Each number is illustrated by a<br>  number of beautiful
  engravings on wood, illustrative of some object of<br>  interest, some incident
  in history, or some scene described in the work. The<br>  publishers have the satisfaction
  to state that the number of subscribers is<br>  now about 15,000; and while about
  200 journals in the United States have<br>  expressed their approbation of it, we
  know of no instance in which an<br>  unfavorable opinion has been expressed.<br></p><p>  We
  state these circumstances, in the hope of extending the interest in a work,<br>  which
  is calculated to be of extensive utility. It is among the cheapest<br>  periodicals
  of the United States.<br></p><p>  The price of this Magazine is one dollar a year—six
  copies for $5—20 copies<br>  for fifteen dollars—or twenty-five quarterly parts
  for five dollars. Payment<br>  in all cases to be made in advance.<br></p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>  Nov.<br>  27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>  18<br></p><p></p>
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: "<em>The People's Magazine</em> was a family-oriented bi-weekly magazine
  that featured stories of distant, exotic, and interesting places, animals, and people.
  It was especially prized for its engravings. It began publication in 1833. Unlike
  many of the periodicals that advertised in <em>The Unionist</em>, it took no political
  or philosophic positions, even implicitly, on slavery."
