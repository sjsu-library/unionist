transcription: "<p>A WORD SUFFICIENT FOR HONORABLE MEN.</p> <p> We know not what Mr.
  Judson and Esq. Adams &amp;c may think—but there are not a few who do think they
  are in honor bound to defray all the expenses to which they have subjected Mr. Olney,
  so entirely without cause. He can ill afford to pay those costs of his late trial,
  and of the previous examination before Esq. Adams, which the law does not allow
  to be paid out of the public treasury. Honor and equity, if not law, demand, that
  he who is guiltless of a crime alleged against him, should not be compelled to pay
  for proving, that his accusers had no cause for their accusation. And who but they
  should bear the expense of such prosecution? <em>A word to the upright is sufficient.</em>
  </p> "
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: So true – presuming that they never made good on repaying Olney what they’d
  cost him, this is another of the costs of being Black in a thoroughly racist America,
  and of true allyship in publicly calling them out for that
