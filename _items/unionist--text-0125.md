transcription: <p>  <em>The Holy Bible in Canton.</em>  â€”A second edition of the Bible
  has been published at the Anglo Chinese <br>  College, in Malacca; it is a large
  and beautiful octavo in 21 volumes, and has <br>  been printed with new blocks.
  Had the College been the means of accomplishing <br>  nothing more than the publication
  of this and a former edition of the Bible, <br>  we should think its founder and
  contributors abundantly repaid for all their <br>  labors. But we know from good
  authority, that many of the students who have <br>  been educated in the college,
  are now filling respectable stations, civil or <br>  commercial in the Straits;
  and that some of them are teaching the English <br>  language in Pegu and Cochin
  China. And above all we rejoice to know that some <br>  have there received the
  gospel in the love of it; obey its precepts; enjoy its <br>  consolations; and assist,
  even in China itself, in diffusing a knowledge of <br>  its righteous requisites
  and its glorious promises. <br></p><p align="right"><em>Chinese Courier</em></p>
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: Robert Morrison (1782-1834) was instrumental in establishing the college
  at Malacca, and the <em>Chinese Courier</em>, as well as facilitating this translation
  of the Bible into Cantonese.
