transcription: '<p>   <em>The Holy Bible in Canton.</em>   â€”A second edition of the
  Bible has been published at the Anglo Chinese   College, in Malacca; it is a large
  and beautiful octavo in 21 volumes, and has   been printed with new blocks. Had
  the College been the means of accomplishing   nothing more than the publication
  of this and a former edition of the Bible,   we should think its founder and contributors
  abundantly repaid for all their   labors. But we know from good authority, that
  many of the students who have   been educated in the college, are now filling respectable
  stations, civil or   commercial in the Straits; and that some of them are teaching
  the English   language in Pegu and Cochin China. And above all we rejoice to know
  that some   have there received the gospel in the love of it; obey its precepts;
  enjoy its   consolations; and assist, even in China itself, in diffusing a knowledge
  of   its righteous requisites and its glorious promises. </p> <p align="right"><em>Chinese
  Courier</em></p> '
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: Robert Morrison (1782-1834) was instrumental in establishing the college
  at Malacca, and the <em>Chinese Courier</em>, as well as facilitating this translation
  of the Bible into Cantonese.
