Scholarly Notes: 
Commentary: "<p>Amos Phelps (1805-1847) was an endorser of the school. His pamphlet
  being locally available suggests, once again, that the students at the Canterbury
  Female Academy were reading about their own struggle!</p><p> <p><br></p><br><p>The
  pamphlet in question, for instance, compared the Canterbury Female Academy students
  to impressed sailors (one of the alleged causes of the War of 1812):<br>  “The war
  of the revolution was a contest for principle. Had the principle in<br>  question
  been yielded, who could have set limits to the acts of oppression<br>  growing out
  it ? So also in our war for sailors’ rights, the bone of<br>  contention was, the
  right of search and impressment. The mere fact that a few<br>  seamen had been injured
  and abused, was as nothing, aside from the principle<br>  involved. This, in common
  with that of the revolution, was a contest for<br>  principle, and the oppression
  resisted was the oppression of principle. And<br>  further, whence the utter odiousness
  and the cruel oppression of the far-famed<br>  ‘black law’ of Connecticut? Not that
  Miss Crandall and a few colored Misses<br>  are subjected by it to certain shameful
  acts of cruelty and oppression. These<br>  are as nothing, comparatively, except
  as they involve principle; and the law,<br>  which allows and sanctions them, is
  itself comparatively harmless and<br>  innocent, except as it involves principle—principle
  which puts in jeopardy the<br>  rights of thousands.</p>  <p>Amos A. Phelps, <br>
