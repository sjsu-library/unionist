transcription: <p align="center">Parley’s Magazine</p><p>  The work was originally
  undertaken as an experiment to ascertain how far the<br>  public would encourage
  a magazine exclusively devoted to one object, viz. the<br>  intellectual instruction
  and moral improvement of the rising generation. In<br>  order to render the work
  extensively useful, a large circulation was<br>  necessary, and to ensure this,
  a very low price was indispensable.<br></p><p>  Every effort has been made to combine
  all these points in the Magazine, and we<br>  are happy to say that the success
  of our experiment thus far, is very<br>  encouraging. The circulation at present
  is nearly 15,000; a number entirely<br>  beyond that of any similar work ever undertaken
  in this country. But great as<br>  it is, such are the accumulated expenses of the
  publication, from the number<br>  of engravings, and from the care attending it,
  together with the very low<br>  price at which it is afforded, that we need a still
  more extended circulation<br>  to enable us fully to develope [sic] our plan, and
  bring into activity all the<br>  means of rendering the work still more efficient
  and useful.<br></p><p>  The idea of a state of society in which there shall not
  be an individual,<br>  either so ignorant, or so depraved, through the faults of
  education, as to be<br>  blind to his interests, and resist the great end of life,
  is perhaps a mere<br>  chimera, but if it is a point that cannot be reached, it
  may certainly be<br>  approached. But how is this to be done? By an union of heart
  and hand, among<br>  the good and wise, in giving the fullest possible activity
  and energy, to<br>  every instrument which leads to the desired end.<br></p><p>  Now,
  if in your opinion, this work is such an instrument, we suggest, as a<br>  means
  by which you may promote its usefulness, some further recommendation of<br>  it
  to the public attention, and in particular to that of teachers of<br>  [indecipherable
  – students? scholars?] and heads of families. The Work is<br>  issued every other
  week, or in quarterly Parts bound in strong cloth hacks [??<br>  On last word]<br></p><p>  The
  price is one dollar a year—six copies will be sent to any one address for<br>  five
  dollars, or ten copies for eight dollars, as we are willing (that every<br>  family
  may be accommodated) to receive twenty-five subscribers for five.<br>  Dollars paid
  quarterly, remitted in advance to the publishers.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  LILLY,<br>  WAIT, &amp; CO.<br></p><p>  Boston, Mass. Oct.<br>  1833.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>  14<br></p><p></p>
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: '"Samuel Goodrich (1793-1860) was born in Ridgefield, Connecticut, the
  6th of ten children and the son of a minister, in 1793. His career as a book publisher
  began in 1816. In the early 1820s Goodrich came to the conclusion that children
  as well as adults preferred to read truth rather than fancy and that it would be
  possible to present history, geography, science, etc. ( truth) in such a way that
  it would be more interesting to children than fairies, giants and monsters. Based
  on this conclusion Goodrich moved his business to Boston and Peter Parley was born
  in 1827 with PETER PARLEY''S TALES ABOUT AMERICA. Goodrich expanded his publishing
  efforts to textbooks and magazines. His publications were so popular that he attracted
  imposters, particularly in England. Spurious Peter Parleys appeared everywhere,
  infuriating Goodrich, but he did not succeed in putting an end to them." from Contextual
