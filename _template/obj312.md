transcription: We finish this week, the Report of Mr. Olney’s Trial, as furnished
  us by MR.<br>FOSTER, a young gentleman of acknowledged skill and fidelity as a reporter;
  and<br>in this presenting to the public an impartial statement of the testimony
  in the<br>case, we cannot but repeat our expression of astonishment that a man should
  have<br>been arrested and bound over for trial, against whom there was not a shadow
  of<br>proof—not even enough to have fixed suspicion upon a man of generally suspicious<br>character,
  much less upon Olney, whose character stands as fair, as that of any<br>person concerned
  in his arrest, examination, or trial. A man who can come out<br>from such a trial,
  not only with a triumphant acquittal, but with a character so<br>perfectly fair
  and unimpeached, notwithstanding all the pains which had been<br>taken beforehand
  to hunt up something against him—the inquiries among his<br>fellow-townsmen, where
  a man’s errors are likely to be known if he has committed<br>any serious ones—has
  certainly abundant reason to complain of the injustice of<br>being subject to so
  much trouble and expense on so slight grounds—rather so<br>utterly without any grounds,
  as Mr. Olney has been. We do not much wonder that<br>the Advertiser, the organ of
  those concerned in the arrest and prosecution of<br>Olney, should contain a Report
  of the evidence, (probably from the pen of Judson<br>himself, or some of his partizans,)
  so discolored in various parts, as to have<br>quite a different impression on the
  mind of readers who heard none of the<br>testimony, from that which the testimony
  itself would have left if they had<br>heard it. We do not much wonder, for instance,
  that the Advertiser’s report<br>should entirely leave out that part of Maria Robinson’s
  testimony in which she<br>says that Mr. Olney had not been alone in the room more
  than a minute before the<br>fire was discovered, thus showing it to have been absolutely
  impossible that he<br>could have fired the house. We mention this as one example
  of the accuracy of<br>that report, but any one who will compare it carefully with
  Mr. Foster’s, will<br>find many other features of dissimilarity calculated to weaken
  the strongly<br>unfavorable impressions which an accurate report would have produced,
  towards<br>those at whose instance Olney was arrested.<br>
