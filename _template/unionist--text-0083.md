transcription: CHINESE COURAGE. While advancing towards Fuh-chow, the capital of Fuh-keen<br>province,
  we meet several war-junks, despathced, doubtless, in quest of us. We<br>happened
  to direct our spy-glass towards one of them, which so intimidated the<br>crew, that
  they ran below decks, and did not reappear till they were sure of<br>having escaped
  the danger. We could only ascribe their panic to mistaking the<br>class for a gun,
  which they supposed pointed at them.—<br><em>Gutzlaff’s Voyage</em>

commentary: As with much travel writing at this time, Gützlaff's tone is patronizing
  and laced with Euro-centric perspectives. Some of Gützlaff's book is available here
