transcription: MR. PRITCHARD, the Lambert of America, is exhibiting himself at the
  American<br>Museum, New York. His height is 6 feet 2 inches—5 feet 10 inches around
  the<br>shoulders, and his legs are as large as the body of an ordinary man; his
  weight<br>is 520 lbs. When moving about on foot, he presents the appearance of a
  giant.<br>His respiration is difficult when sleeping, unless his head is elevated
  quite<br>above his body, and he then snores, very loudly.—<br><em>Christian Secretary.</em>
Scholarly Notes: 
Commentary: Mr. Pritchard is here compared to Daniel Lambert (1770-1809), a gargantuan
  man who was exhibited as a curiosity in the first decade of the nineteenth century
  in England. His name spawned a number of phrases that referred to large size.
