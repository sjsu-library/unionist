transcription: <p align="right">FOR THE UNIONIST.</p><p>  “Philosophy, though eagle-eyed
  in nature’s tendencies” has not succeeded in  drawing a line of discrimination between
  the members of the human family, so  marked as to proscribe from the commonwealth
  of humanity those who Cowper says  are “guilty of a skin not colored like his own.”
  Indeed if my complexion does  afford proof that I am not so nobly born, not endowed
  with the same  unalienable privileges and rights as those of a different color,
  I declare  that I am not ambitious of attaining their prerogatives, by changing
  skins  with any of them—and much less do I repine at the decrees of Him who has
  made  of one blood all the nations of the earth.</p><p>  Though in the New-England
  States color is not deemed a sufficient offence to  consign the limbs of the tawny
  inhabitant to the shackle, and his back to the  scourge, yet the prejudices of the
  South are not wholly unfelt in the North;  although the fetter falls from the limb
  of the African, when his foot touches  the New England soil, still there lingers
  about the heart of a yankee some of  that bitterness and contempt towards his colored
  brethren, which forged  galling chains for that oppressed race.</p><p>  Many specious
  arguments have been advanced to prove the justness of African  Slavery, and although
  many honest men have met and refuted them, others have  allowed themselves to be
  wheedled into the comfortable idea, that they are  made of better clay, and entitled
  to more consideration, than their degraded  sufferers. Let me call upon  <em>you</em>  ,
  who have still a small proportion of humanity left in your bosoms, to start  from
  the siren flaterers, who would lull you to repose, while thousand of your  fellow
  creatures groan beneath the lash of unfeeling tyrants, under the flag  of a nation
  professing to be guided by the law of Liberty, and Equal Rights!  Have you not professed
  to the world, that “ALL MEN ARE BORN FREE AND EQUAL.”  Is not this mockery? Are
  not these very letters shaded by the crimson blood of  your suffering brethren?
  Or  <em>are not</em>  Africans men? Tyrant, does not your bleeding slave while kneeling
  to you for  mercy, address you in the language of human nature—and do not  <em>you</em>  prove
  yourself incapable of appreciating that language? ‘Tis  <em>you</em>  who seem less
  than a man, and most devoid of every principle, every attribute  of humanity.</p><p>  One
  miserable refuge, behind which the slave-holder retreats, is this; that  many slaves
  are very well satisfied with their situation and would not wish to  change it!”
  Very fine indeed! Because you have reduced them to this abject  dependence, and
  perverted all the noble independence of their nature, you have  a right to trample
  upon their undeniable rights, and continue the iniquitous  business! Because a blind
  man loves the taste of arsenic, (being ignorant of  its deadly tendency) you will
  thrust it down his throat! From what must that  contentedness arise, which induces
  the slave to embrace the scourge and hub  the fetter. Would  <em>you</em>  be content
  to drudge for a master, and crouch at his feet like a dog? You say  “death before
  slavery,” and you would despise a white man who would submit to  the degradation
  of unlimited subordination. Because a wretch who is weary of  life requests you
  to shoot him, would you be justified in blowing his brains  out with a pistol? Answer
  these questions ye advocates for slavery, and if  “custom has not steeled your hearts”
  to every principle of rectitude, you will  see that mercy to a negro entitles you
  to no praise, since he has the same  claim to liberty and respect as a European.</p><p

Scholarly Notes: Black male writer
Commentary: Black writer, important piece, identity speculation? Perhaps the most
  important<br>indication of the Black male presence in the Unionist as a local voice<br>
