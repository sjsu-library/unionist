transcription: 'There are those to whom a sense of religion has come in storm and
  tempest: thereare those whom it has summoned amid scenes of revelry and idle vanity:
  there arethose, too, who have heard its ‘still small voice’ amid rural leisure and
  placidcontentment; but perhaps the knowledge which causeth not to err, is mostfrequently
  impressed upon the mind during seasons of affliction; and tears arethe softened
  showers which cause the seed of heaven to spring and take root inthe human breast.—<em>Walter
  Scott</em>'
