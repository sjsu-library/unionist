transcription: "<p>  <em>U.S. Deposits.</em>  —A writer in the Boston Daily Advertiser,
  who is evidently familiar with  banking operations, shows by mathematical demonstration,
  that “The Government  deposits, cannot be removed from the Bank of the United States,
  because there  is no local Bank strong enough to take them, burthened as such a
  duty is with  the obligation, on the part of such local Bank, to receive the bills
  of all  the branches of the Bank of the United States and to pay out Gold and Silver,
  \ for the checks of the Government.” It is also stated that the proposed removal
  \ is illegal, and not within the power of the Executive.</p><p>The New York Commercial
  Advertiser contains the following paragraph:—</p><p>  “Of one thing we feel very
  strongly assured, and we wish well what we say. No  matter what terms or conditions
  are offered by the local banks—  <em>the deposits will not be removed.</em>  And
  further: No matter for the sentiments or the vetoes of the President,  <em>the Charter
  of the Bank will one day be renewed.”</em></p><p></p>"
