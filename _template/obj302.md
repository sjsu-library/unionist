  for the Unionist.]</p><p>  TRIAL OF FREDERIC OLNEY. (  <em>Concluded.</em>  )</p><p>
  \ <em>Windham County Court</em>  ss.  <em>March Term,</em>  1834.</p><p>Present,
  Hon. Judges Eaton, Griffin and Chase.</p><p>State vs. Frederic Olney</p><p>  <em>Mary
  Burleigh.</em>  —This witness stated the same general facts as before stated, and
  added that  when she came down into the keeping room, before dinner, she perceived
  a bad  smell—that after dinner, she returned to the keeping room, perceived a little
  \ smoke in the room, where the rays of the sun were, and the smell was so  disagreeable
  that she took the paper which she was reading, and went up stairs  <em>(sic)</em>
  \ to the school room. On her cross examination, being asked if she named the  subject
  of the smell at the time; did the evening after, to Miss P. Crandall  and others;
  heard Olney say after the alarm was over, that if it had not been  for the fire,
  he should have been gone, or away in a few moments.</p><p>  <em>Maria Harris</em>
  \ testified that Olney came to the kitchen from the keeping room soon after his
  \ arrival and asked if he could not have some breakfast; that he came from home
  \ early and had not eaten any; witness asked Charles to bring some biscuit from
  \ the closet; After Olney had eaten he went back to the keeping room; then came
  \ back, and staid till dinner time; did not go out of doors, only went to the  cellar
  kitchen; Olney ate dinner and staid some time in the kitchen  afterwards; witness
  had just got ready to wash her spoons &amp;c. as Olney  left the kitchen to go to
  the keeping-room; she had not washed any as she  recollects when she heard the cry
  of fire; it was possibly five minutes after  Olney left the kitchen when she heard
  the cry.</p><p>  <em>Cross-Examined.</em>  Olney took his loose coat when he left
  the kitchen and said he was going to  bid Miss. Crandall good bye, or that he was
  going to see her a few moments and  must then go to Brooklyn; do not know whether
  he put his coat on or not; don’t  remember seeing him put it on.</p><p>  <em>Betsey
  Fish</em>  was in the cellar kitchen when Olney came down first; he staid perhaps
  fifteen  minutes; did not go out of doors but returned up stairs; left Olney at
  dinner  when she finished.</p><p>  <em>Charles Harris</em>  (testified to preliminary
  facts same as others.) Saw Olney in the keeping room  writing before dinner and
  not long afterwards h brought witness a letter and  asked him to carry it to the
  post-office; witness carried it when they were at  dinner; after dinner Olney said
  he was going to Brooklyn, that he would go and  bid Miss Crandall good bye before
  he started; this was in the kitchen; very  soon he heard fire cried; ran out and
  saw smoke at the corner of the house;  got an axe and Olney struck into the corner
  and the smoke burst out; witness  then went and rang the bell and people immediately
  came; he took up the carpet  in the keeping room after he got back; it was nailed
  down round the edge at  the corner and elsewhere; it was snug and tight and filled
  up the crack; it  was nearly new, thick, and bound around the edge; has examined
  it to see if it  was singed and found it was not; no scorch on it or on the mop-board;
  Olney  struck the mouldings on the east side of the corner at first, but could not
  \ start them; he then struck on the north side and the smoke came right out; the
  \ letter which witness carried to the post-office was directed to a ____  Marshall;
  don’t remember the first name.</p><p>  <em>Cross examined.</em>  Delivered the letter
  at the office when they were eating dinner at Miss  Crandall’s; said nothing about
  this before the Justice’s Court; don’t now  remember whether he then said that he
  went but once out of the kitchen and  that was to carry wood to the fire; thinks
  he was not out but this time that  he speaks of; don't remember having been at Jenk’s
  store about noon; did not  go there from the post-office but went directly home;
  don’t remember having a  conversation with two persons at Col. Judson’s corner when
  he went to the  post-office; when Olney left the kitchen he said he would bid Miss
  Crandall  good bye and start for Brooklyn; saw clapboards cut off when he came back
  from  ringing the bell;</p><p><em>Note to self: were they trying to frame Charles,
  too?</em></p><p>  <em>Elizabeth Marshall</em>  resides in the city of New York;
  on the 23d or 24  <sup>th</sup>  of January last Olney left New York and took a
  letter, and bundle &amp;c. to  her little daughter at Miss Crandall’s school at
  Canterbury; witness had  before sent a bundle to her daughter which had miscarried
  in October last;  Olney said he would write to witness as soon as he got to Canterbury
  and tell  her whether he had found it or not and also tell her about her daughter;
  the  Saturday night of the week following Olney’s departure from New York, when
  \ witness returned home from her work, her eldest daughter told her that she had
  \ got a letter from Olney, and read it to her. (witness not being able to read);
  \ [The witness here produced a half sheet of letter paper written over, which he
  \ said was the letter paper written over, which he said was the letter read to  her
  by her daughter; it was dated Canterbury January 28  <sup>th</sup>  1834, and purported
  to be a letter from Frederic Olney to Mrs. Marshall; the  other half of the sheet,
  which was the one containing the direction and post  mark witness said she had used
  to light her lamp one morning, soon after  receiving the letter, having risen before
  it was light.]</p><p>  <em>    Note to self: Olney’s name was misspelt once as Onley;
  note also that there    seems to be some gender confusion about the witness in here
  \ </em></p><p>  <em>Mary Jane Benson.</em>  After dinner at Miss Crandall’s on the
  day of the fire, witness went from the  dinner table in the kitchen to the keeping
  room in company with Miss Willis  and others; soon after entering the keeping room
  Miss Willis asked, what  smells so? witness replies that it was like old chestnut
  wood burning; Olney  was at this time eating his dinner in the kitchen; witness
  went from the  keeping room into the space and fro thence she thinks she went to
  the school  room; don’t recollect seeing any smoke.</p><p>  <em>Cross examined.</em>
  \ The conversation about the smell was after dinner, as soon as she had done;  don't
  remember whether any one was in the keeping room when they came to it;  those with
  witness were Miss. Willis and Miss. De Grasse, &amp;c.; don’t  remember that any
  but Miss Willis asked as to the smell: had no particular  business in the room,
  and did not remain in it more than two or three minutes;  do not recollect whether
  she had spoken to any one of this but Mr. Tyler;  “don’t remember how the conversation
  was then introduced; don’t recollect that  Mr. Tyler said to her that other girls
  had stated a similar story.</p><p>[The defendant’s counsel here rested their testimony.]</p><p>The
  counsel for the prosecution then called</p><p>  <em>Charles Harris,</em>  who being
  asked, if Olney had not been requested by Miss Crandall not to visit  at her house,
  said not to his knowledge, witness has never said so.</p><p>  <em>William Kinne</em>
  \ was called by Miss Crandall to examine her house after the burning, and did  so;
  has looked at it twice; if the fire was introduced under the mop-board it  would
  have gone to the place where the most burning was; for this reason  thinks the fire
  was set from the inside; the inside of the sheathing board was  burned most; thinks
  the fire began on the sill.</p><p>  <em>Cross-examined</em>  Did not ascertain whether
  the bottom of the sill was burnt or not; the line  was discolored in some places,
  in others not; he differed from the majority o  those who examined with him as to
  the origin of the fire.</p><p>  <em>George Middleton</em>  examined the house with
  the committee from the Insurance Company; concurs  generally in their statements
  and thinks the fire caught from within.</p><p>  <em>Andrew Harris.</em>  (Large
  fragments of the house were brought into court, which were put together  by Dr.
  Harris, who explained at length their situation and appearance; Dr  Harris was not
  present at the fire but examined the house carefully at  different times afterwards.
  Being asked his opinion as to the origin of the  fire, he answered that he had not
  been willing to form an opinion on the  subject, and did not think the question
  could be answered except by  probabilities.</p><p>  <em>Mary Harris</em>  was at
  her father’s when the stage stopped at Miss Crandall’s; saw the driver  get down
  and take off bundles; a man alighted and stood on the east side of  the horses;
  tried to ascertain if he was Olney; the man with the driver got  down; the driver
  stood on the box a part of the time; he stepped down to take  the reins from Olney
  and then returned to his place.</p><p>  <em>    Note to self: this was a daughter
  of Andrew Harris, not Sarah Harris’s    sister  </em></p><p>  <em>Mrs. A. T. Judson</em>
  \ saw the stage stop at Miss Crandall’s; the driver left his box and gave the  reins
  to Olney; did not at this time know Olney; saw him afterwards; a woman  got into
  the stage from Miss Crandall’s; did not see Olney get out; witness  left her window
  before the stage started; the driver carried in one box.</p><p>  <em>George S. White</em>
  \ was now called by defendants counsel to explain the appearance of some parts  of
  the timber shown by Dr. Harris; not remembering in relation to them.</p><p>  <em>Albert
  Hinckley</em>  was again called, and gave the explanations.</p><p>  <em>Elkanah
  C. Eaton.</em>  was again called by the counsel for the prosecution, and stated
  that when he  examined the house, the sill was firm upon the mortar; the outer edge
  was  burnt nearly to the bottom; that he assisted in putting the timber together
  as  they were before the fire, and there was no chance of any communication from
  \ without except where the pointing was out; expressed an opinion as before that
  \ the fire caught from within.</p><p>  <em>Betsey Fish</em>  was again called by
  defendant’s counsel, and she stated that she brought the  first pail of water; that
  it was turned in at the corner below, while Olney  was cutting a hole to come at
  the fire.</p><p>  The testimony being closed on both sides, A.T. Judson Esq. opened
  on the part  of the prosecution, D.P. Tyler Esq. opened on the part of the prisoner
  and was  followed by the Hon. Calvin Goddard on the same side; C.F. Cleveland Esq.
  \ closed for the prosecution.—It seemed to be tacitly admitted that the fire was
  \ caused by design. The counsel for the prosecution claimed that the fire was  communicated
  from within and that it was done by Olney. The opposing counsel  insisted that the
  balance of proof was that the fire was communicated from  without, but whether from
  within or from without, no testimony whatever had  been adduced tending to show
  that Olney was guilty. The charge of his Honor  Judge EATON was brief, but distinguished
  for its ability and impartiality. The  jury retired, and after a short absence returned
  a verdict of  <em>not guilty.</em></p><p>  The trial occupied the court from 2 o’clock
  in the afternoon of Thursday, till  6 o’clock P.M. on Saturday. F.</p><p></p>"
Scholarly Notes: Note that there is a missing Part Two. <em><br>  “F” identified elsewhere
  in the paper as Mr. Foster. Henry Foster was a Black<br>  leader in Hartford, and
  Stephen Foster was already familiar with WLG in the<br>  late 1820s. A quick Ancestry
  look reveals plenty of people from Windham county<br>  with that last name. No other
  references to other Fosters in the other<br></em><br>Unionists. Very unlikely to
  be Stephen Foster who was still in school at the<br>time, but not impossible.<br>
Commentary: 'Another one of the most important gems within <em>The Unionist</em>.
  The key is the testimony of Elizabeth Marshall, who corroborates Frederick Olney''s
  reason to be at the school that day '
