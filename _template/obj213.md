Scholarly Notes: 
Commentary: 'Philip Pearl Jr. has a checkered history in the saga of the Canterbury
  Female Academy. His daughter Hannah attended the first version of the Academy, before
  the change to Black students. Philip Pearl Jr. was an elected legislator who helped
  to draft the law in 1833, and lobbied it through the Assembly. He was perceived
  as Andrew Judson''s most important ally in Connecticut state politics. However,
  he was converted to anti-slavery by Theodore Dwight Weld, and in 1837 led the effort
  to repeal the Black Law! On the petition from his town of Hampton, he signed the
  petition at the top in bold pen. Petitions re: Repeal of Act Prohibiting Education
  of Colored Persons RG002, Box 26 General Assembly Papers 1837-1838, folder #16,
  document 14.'
