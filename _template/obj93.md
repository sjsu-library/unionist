transcription: <p align="right">FOR THE UNIONIST.</p><p>  Mr. Editor. It is truly
  astonishing to witness the efforts at  misrepresentation in the last Advertiser
  respecting Miss Crandall’s trial.—It  is the part of wisdom in the many correspondents
  to that paper that they have  not signed their names to the articles communicated.
  An article appears headed  this, “Effects of abolition principles in a Court of
  Justice.” The writer  attempts, in his way, to question the veracity of persons
  who were called upon  to testify, when they said that they had drank tea with Miss
  Crandall and her  scholars but could not recollect the countenances of any who were
  then in  court. From this circumstance the writer wishes to convey the idea to his  readers
  that they were guilty of swearing falsely, and thus were it in his  power, would
  he fix upon them the seal of infamy. The writer of that article  should know, that
  however much honorable men may differ from him in sentiment,  merely a difference
  of opinion does not render them incapable of speaking the  truth, and whenever he
  touches upon an honorable man’s character, he touches a  very tender spot. However
  lightly he may regard it,—character, in the  estimation of some men—some abolitionists
  we trust—ay, even some who have had  the hardihood to  <em>sit at the same table</em>  with
  Miss Crandall and her colored misses—is above all price. The writer  thinks it is
  a most incredible circumstance that a person could drink tea with  20 misses whom
  he never saw before, and 2 or 3 months afterwards, when he  should see misses in
  a public assembly, could not recollect that they were the  persons with whom he
  drank tea. Perhaps they were present at the table, and  perhaps they were not. But
  suppose they were—would it be any thing strange for  a  <em>gentleman</em>  to sit
  down at table with 20 misses, half of them perhaps, sitting in a direct  line with
  himself, (so that it would be extremely difficult for him to see  them) and not
  seeing their countenances so as immediately to recollect them  when seen a number
  of weeks afterwards, with their bonnets on—in a different  attire—in a “court of
  Justice?” Surely these gentlemen—as they said they could  not recollect them—must
  be set down as liars, for no one can doubt—considering  the circumstances—that there
  was a  <em>reasonable possibility</em>  of their not knowing them at a glance—whether
  they were there or not. We would  advise the writer of that article to look up much
  reckless villains and have  them tried for perjury.</p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  JUSTICE.</p>
