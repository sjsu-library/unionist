  8, 1833, 1:2:2, column 5<br></p><p>FROM THE HARTFORD TIMES!!</p><p>  We have received
  the letter of Messrs Rufus Adams and Andrew T. Judson<br>  relating to the negro
  school at Canterbury. It cannot be doubted that these<br>  gentlemen have been much
  abused and misrepresented; [☞] but we believe there<br>  are no new facts set forth
  in this letter requiring its publication. [☞]<br></p><p>So Mr. Judson has wasted
  his paper and ink.</p>"
