transcription: "<p>  <em>Modern Refinement.</em>  —In the slave-holding States it
  has ever been contrary to law to bestow the  advantages of education on a negro.
  For this regulation there is some show of  plausible reasoning. We were not aware,
  however, that in the very heart of  New-England there existed any such prohibition,
  until we saw it stated in the  public prints, that a lady who had been engaged in
  keeping a school for blacks  in Connecticut, had been arrested and thrown intro
  prison. She is placed in  the same cell which has been occupied by a convicted murderer!
  There is  something quite romantic in all this—inasmuch as it savors of the notions
  held  in olden times—for instance, the chivalric days of the Sixth Harry:</p><p>
  \ <em>Cade.</em>  Thou hast most notoriously corrupted the youth of the realm, in
  erecting&nbsp;  a grammar school. It will be proved to thy face that thou hast those
  about  thee, that usually talk of a noun and a verb, and such abominable words as
  no  christian can endure to hear.”  <em>Nantucket Inquirer</em></p>"
