transcription: "<p>  The Unionist says that we “exposed nothing but our own ignorance”—Indeed?
  If  we exhibit nothing else, we may be considered very happy. There are some that
  \ we wot of who  <em>do</em>  expose something besides their ignorance—videlicet,
  a goodly share of  self-conceit—and they are so placed side by side as to be equally
  conspicuous.</p><p>  There is nothing of which we are more sensible than our own
  deficiencies, but  some of the  <em>wise ones</em>  who occasionally put us in mind
  of them, neither point them out nor suggest  their remedy, &amp; we of course must
  remain in our ignorance. We cannot boast  of our acquirements.</p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  “Knowledge  and wisdom, far from being one,</p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  “Have  ofttimes no connexion—</p><p>  *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  \ *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  \ *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  “Knowledge  is  <em>proud that he has learn’d so much</em>  ;</p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  “Wisdom is  humble that he knows no more.”</p>"
