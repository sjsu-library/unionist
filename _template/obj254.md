transcription: "<p>A WORD SUFFICIENT FOR HONORABLE MEN.</p><p>  We know not what Mr.
  Judson and Esq. Adams &amp;c may think—but there are not<br>  a few who do think
  they are in honor bound to defray all the expenses to which<br>  they have subjected
  Mr. Olney, so entirely without cause. He can ill afford to<br>  pay those costs
  of his late trial, and of the previous examination before Esq.<br>  Adams, which
  the law does not allow to be paid out of the public treasury.<br>  Honor and equity,
  if not law, demand, that he who is guiltless of a crime<br>  alleged against him,
  should not be compelled to pay for proving, that his<br>  accusers had no cause
  for their accusation. And who but they should bear the<br>  expense of such prosecution?<br>
  \ <em>A word to the upright is sufficient.</em></p>"
Scholarly Notes: 
Commentary: So true – presuming that they never made good on repaying Olney what they’d
  cost him, this is another of the costs of being Black in a thoroughly racist America,
  and of true allyship in publicly calling them out for that
