transcription: "“The editor of the “Unionist” must bear the disappointment with pious<br>resignation.
  His good intentions towards us are duly appreciated—but he has<br>failed of his
  object entirely. We cannot, particularly with the thermometer at<br>95, be drawn
  into a controversy with<br><em>him</em>on the subject of anti-ism. We have asserted
  nothing of that pestilent doctrine<br>which is not abundantly borne out by facts—besides,
  any thing about “falsehood<br>and ignorance” comes with a very ill grace from that
  quarter. We shall have<br>Satan, by and bye, ringing the parish bell and reproving
  sin with as much zeal<br>as if he had no part nor lot in the matter.”<br>"
