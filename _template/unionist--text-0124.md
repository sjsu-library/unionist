transcription: "<em>Kidnapping.</em>—A man of color, named John Hill, was brought
  before the police magistrate on<br>Monday, charged with abduction, in taking away
  Sarah Jane Demons, a girl of<br>color, aged six years, from the house of Emilia
  Smith, a woman of color, who<br>resides at 99 Greenwich st. On Sunday evening three
  gentlemen observed the<br>prisoner carrying a child, which was crying, and seemed
  very reluctant to be<br>taken away. The gentlemen stopped Hill, and questioned him
  as to how he came in<br>possession of the child. He gave them evasive answers, and
  they then inquired of<br>the child where she lived. The little girl told them her
  place of residence, and<br>signified her entire ignorance of the cause for which
  Hill had taken her away.<br>The gentlemen considered the case sufficiently suspicious
  to warrant them in<br>arresting the prisoner, and one of them, assisted by a man
  of color, named<br>Bristol Martin, lodged him in prison, whilst the other restored
  the little girl<br>to her friends. Hill’s explanation of the affair was, that he
  merely took the<br>child to<br><em>give it some candy</em>. He had been seen the
  same evening endeavoring to take away another child, who,<br>however, struggled
  so hard as to make him abandon his design. The occurrence<br>created considerable
  excitement amongst the people of color in the city, a large<br>number of whom attended
  to hear the case disposed of. Hill was committed to<br>prison.—<br><em>Jour. Com.</em>"
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: Kidnapping of free Blacks in northern cities would have been a major fear
  for the students at the Canterbury Female Academy. This article, and the one preceding
  closely on it concerning kidnapping free Blacks into slavery, are from the New York<br><em>Journal
  of Commerce</em>, another journalistic innovation by Arthur Tappan, in partnership
  with Samuel Morse.<br><br>
