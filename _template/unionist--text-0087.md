  Morris and<br>Morrison were the opposing candidatesâ€”two thousand thirty-five votes
  were<br>polled. In one county Morris had a majority of<br><em>nine</em>votes, in
  the other county Morrison had a majority of<br><em>ten</em>votes, and of course
  was elected by a majority of<br><em>one.</em>
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: I have yet to uncover solid evidence of this vote. Historians of the nineteenth-century
  Indiana State Senate, rescue me!
