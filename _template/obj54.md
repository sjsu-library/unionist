transcription: JUVENILE INTREPEDITY. On Monday afternoon last, a child of four years
  of age,fell from the wharf at the foot of Northmore street into the water; ThomasBennet,
  a lad fourteen years old, immediately jumped overboard with all hisclothes on to
  rescue him. He succeeded in reaching the child, swam with him to asloop, and held
  on until assistance arrived. It is seldom we record conductevincing so much courage
  and coolness, and still more to find it in the case ofa mere lad. He deserves much
  credit.â€”<em>N.Y. Standard</em>
