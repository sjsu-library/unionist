transcription: "<p>  “Our friend of the Providence Patriot is mistaken in attributing
  to us, the  writings of “Inistail.” The credit of those writings, whatever it may
  be,  belongs to another person, though it is, (to adopt the language of our  neighbor
  up stairs) “all in the family.” –  <em>Brooklyn (Ct.) Unionist.”</em></p><p>  “”All
  in the family,:” is it? Then, to use the language of an Irishman who was  once led
  into a similar error, we can only say to Mr. Burleigh,—“faith, sir,  and we thought
  you were your  <em>brother!””</em></p>"
Scholarly Notes: Since there was no "Inistail" in 1.2, that means it is either in
  1.1 or 1.3, with this response being 1.4
