transcription: "<p>“O! SHAME! SHAME!!”</p><p>  ☞“The following paragraph is  extracted
  from the Unionist of last week:” </p><p>  “’The laudable efforts of the Canterbury
  worthies to drive Miss Crandall from  her purpose, by withholding from her the necessaries
  of life, will have the  effect to perpetuate their own well earned fame, if not
  to attain its primary  object. The latest measure which we have heard of their adopting,
  is the  FILLING MISS C’S WELL WITH MANURE FROM THE BARNYARD,  <em>and then refusing
  to give her water from their own wells.’”</em></p>"
