transcription: "<p>  We cannot consent to be drawn, as the Unionist seems desirous
  that we should  be, into a lengthened controversy upon its favorite topic. The whole
  matter  lies in a nut-shell, and the editor knows, or ought to know, what is the
  real  matter in dispute—when confined to  <em>that</em>  there is but little to
  be said on his side of the subject. It is only by  multiplying words, and turning
  off the attention from the true merits of the  debate, that the abolitionists can
  hope to obtain a hearing. No better  evidence is wanted of the weakness of the cause
  than the confessions of the  Genius of Temperance, that Abolition cannot hope to
  succeed without the  destruction of the Colonization Society. That Society has effected
  the  emancipation of may slaves, whereas abolitionism has not yet freed one.  <em>By
  their fruits ye shall know them.</em>  Let us suppose a [..]se—not a very probable
  one, it must be confessed, yet if  the abolitionists are to be believed they expect
  to see a part, at least, of  it fulfilled—and are laboring to bring it about—Suppose
  that every person  north of the Potomac and the Ohio rivers became an abolitionist—as
  dedicated  and fierce as Garrison himself—that those who are south of this line
  remain  just as they are—some few honorable to the Colonization Society, here and
  \ there one [..]ling and anxious to be rid of his slaves, but the great majority
  \ desirous to retain them. Now supposing such a {…]e of public opinion—and  with&nbsp;
  the&nbsp; Constitution directly in their teeth, what course, we  ask, would the
  abolitionists most probably pursue? If they answer,  <em>we do not know,</em>  then
  they are laboring without any definite views—and if they  <em>do know,</em>  we
  should be very glad to be informed. The Unionist has rather inflated (and  probably
  mistaken) notions of its own importance. It brags of being admitted  to the private
  counsels of the leaders, which we must be permitted to doubt.  The Unionist is too
  young to be initiated into all the secrets of the sect.  Doubtless when Garrison,
  or his worthy friend from New York, passes along this  way, they pat the Editor
  on the head—call him a nice little fellow—let him  know some of the least important
  of their plans—tell him to be a good boy,  and, by the bye, he shall know more—and
  anon his vanity makes him believe he  is in their full confidence. As you would
  avoid disappointment, do not trust  it too strongly.</p><p>  The Unionist must excuse
  us from further notice for the present, and probably  for some time to come. Congress
  meet this week, and some very important  subjects will be brought up for discussion.
  We wish to listen, and, if  possible, learn something of their merits.</p>"
Scholarly Notes: there are some problems with folds in the first column that leave
