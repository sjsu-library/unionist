transcription: "<p>THE UNIONIST</p><p>BROOKLYN, DECEMBER 19, 1833.</p><p>  <em>Is
  it safe to obey God?—</em>  Startle not at the query, reader, but answer it candidly.
  Has God commanded us  to do any thing which would be unsafe are [sic-obvious printing
  error]  inexpedient for us to do? If he has, then, painful as it might seem, it
  is our  duty to obey, for surely God will not require an unnecessary sacrifice of
  any  one. But we believe that it is not only always  <em>safe</em>  to obey the
  commands of God, but that our safety consists in such obedience  alone. We believe
  that He commands us to do nothing except what is for our  best good, and that we
  are not safe for a moment while we refuse to obey.  Should we not therefore obey
  \ <em>all</em>  the commands of God—  <em>now‑immediately?</em>  We should—the candid
  and christian reader will echo the reply,  <em>“we should!”</em>  Well—so much for
  the sermon, now for the application.</p><p>  God has commanded—  <em>“Undo the heavy
  burdens and let the oppressed go free.”</em>  Not yet, says the colonizationist—the
  oppressed, though they are happy and  contended in their bondage, would so highly
  resent the gift of liberty and the  proffer of kindness and sympathy that they would
  cut our throats for the gift  and burn our dwellings for the proffer. It would not
  be safe to obey the  command of God NOW—wait, and let us leave off sinning by degrees
  and make a  compromise with God that will leave us in our sins a few years longer.
  Such  is, in effect, the reasoning of the apologist for slavery. When will the time
  \ come in which men will think it sage and expedient to obey the Supreme Ruler  of
  the Universe?</p>"
