transcription: "<em>Mr. Pearl.</em>—We again avert to this gentleman, that we may
  correct an erroneous impressionthat has gone abroad, induced by an article in our
  paper of week before last, inwhich we alluded to his nomination for Senator. A meaning
  was attached to ourremarks by some, which we never intended should be and never
  thought would beattached to them—namely, that because Mr. Pearl is a farmer, and
  not aprofessional man, he is therefore unqualified for the office to which he isnominated.
  Nothing could be farther from our intention than to convey such anidea. Till within
  a few years we were ourself a farmer, and from a more intimateacquaintance with
  that class of working-men than with any other, we take themost lively interest in
  every thing calculated to promote their political ormoral welfare. We are not opposed
  to Mr. Pearl because he is not a professionalman, but because we believe him opposed
  to some of those eternal principles ofright which are to us dear as the apple of
  our eye, and which we feel ourselfsolemnly pledged to defend according to the best
  of our feeble abilities. ForMr. Pearl’s private character we entertain the most
  unfeigned respect—but whilewe believe him pursuing a political course which we consider
  detrimental to ourdearest interests as a people, we must, if we would be honest,
  most strenuouslyoppose his political elevation.”"
Scholarly Notes: Feb 27 1834 Unionist had something opposed to Pearl's candidacy
Commentary: Because the author identifies himself as a farmer, I have defaulted to
  giving authorship here to Charles Burleigh
