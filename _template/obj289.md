transcription: "<p>THE PEOPLE’S MAGAZINE</p><p>  This work is published twice a month,
  is furnished to subscribers at $1 a  year. It contains a large mass of information,
  and is designed as an amusing  and instructive miscellany for families. Each number
  is illustrated by a  number of beautiful engravings on wood, illustrative of some
  object of  interest, some incident in history, or some scene described in the work.
  The  publishers have the satisfaction to state that the number of subscribers is
  \ now about 15,000; and while about 200 journals in the United States have  expressed
  their approbation of it, we know of no instance in which an  unfavorable opinion
  has been expressed.</p><p>  We state these circumstances, in the hope of extending
  the interest in a work,  which is calculated to be of extensive utility. It is among
  the cheapest  periodicals of the United States.</p><p>  The price of this Magazine
  is one dollar a year—six copies for $5—20 copies  for fifteen dollars—or twenty-five
  quarterly parts for five dollars. Payment  in all cases to be made in advance. Nov.
