transcription: "<p>ACQUITTAL OF MR. OLNEY.</p><p>  ☞We are gratified to learn, by
  the last number of the Unionist, printed at  Brooklyn, that Mr. Frederick Olney,
  a reputable and truly excellent citizen of  Norwich, who was taken up by Andrew
  T. Judson &amp; Co. on a charge of having  fired Miss Crandall’s dwelling a few
  weeks since, has been acquitted. The  Unionist says—‘The Jury would probably have
  given their verdict without  leaving their seats, if they had previously chosen
  a foreman. But so  soon&nbsp; as they had returned to their room and organized,
  they gave a  unanimous vote in his favor.’ The same paper gives a long report of
  the trial,  which shows that a more paltry and vile attempt to incriminate an honest
  man  was never made in our land.</p>"
Scholarly Notes: 
Commentary: "<em>The Liberator</em> reports on the acquittal of Olney, and takes a
  sentence from <em>The Unionist</em> coverage. "
