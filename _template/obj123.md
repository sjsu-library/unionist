transcription: "<em>Character of the Dutch,</em>—It is well known that a habit prevails
  almost every where, of underrating anddisparaging Dutch character and Dutchmen.
  Nothing is more unjust, and nothing ismore common—nothing testifies more unequivocally
  the ignorance and prejudice ofthose who indulge in it, than the habit.—England is
  called the mother; but ifsuch of our population, whose ancestors emigrated from
  her shores are proud oftheir origin, much more reason have they, who are descendants
  of the honestburgomasters of Holland, to be proud of theirs.—Holland, though occupying
  aterritory not larger than the state of Maryland, was first among the nations ofEurope
  to take a stand in favor of liberty, and, single handed, maintained a sixyears’
  war in its defence, against the greatest odds. At a time when France andEngland
  were yet involved in bigotry and superstition, Holland achieved forherself civil
  and religious freedom, and opened her bosom as an asylum for theoppressed Huguenots;
  while other, the pilgrim fathers sought a refuge frompersecution in the wilds of
  America. Holland for a long time took the lead ofall the surrounding nations in
  commerce, in science, in arts, and in arms. Forthe inventions of the telescope,
  microscope, thermometer, pendulum, gunpowder,and printing, the world is indebted
  to the Dutch. And the best and most correcttranslation of the original Scriptures,
  in any language, is that of the LowDutch, made under the auspices of the Synod of
  Dort."
Scholarly Notes: Could this be a sly parallel to racial prejudice?
