  great things—expect great things.” (The voice of the departed. [sic  no close parentheses]</p><p>  IN
  consequence of the light poured on the public, and the church, by the  spirited
  exertions of philanthropic individuals, a great change, in relation  to intoxicating
  liquors, has been produced. The eye, heart, and hand of  christian faith looks,
  prays, and acts for its completion.</p><p>  But another reformation is needed in
  the church. It must be as separate from  slavery, as from intemperance. The nation
  groans under the burden and misery  and guilt of both these sins. It is the solemn
  duty of the church to clear  itself from both these tremendous crimes. This is not
  addressed to the world,  for the world legalizes the traffic in rum, and in the
  bodies and souls of  men. But it is addressed to the children of God, who, if they
  know and do  their duty, can have no possible connection with either of these trades.
  If  increasing light has shown that christians ought not to buy and sell ardent  spirits,
  much more it is believed, will increasing light show that christians  ought not
  to buy human beings.</p><p>  The Rev John Newton, even after he became pious, transported
  Africans in  chains across the Atlantic, to be sold with their posterity into slavery.  Could
  he have been a true christian, and have no upbraidings of conscience  while so engaged?
  Yes. How is it possible? It was legal, and, at that time,  honorable, and his mind
  was not enlightened.—Afterwards when it was he  lamented his error. So there are
  in our country those who buy and sell their  fellow beings, who, if their minds
  were enlightened, would lament and  relinquish it.</p><p>  A few years ago, a man,
  whose whole daily earnings were required by his  family, set up forty nights to
  run a distillery for forty dollars, which he  gave to build a house of worship.—How
  could he think that money obtained by  changing the bread of the poor, into the
  liquid fire of death, acceptable to  God? Because his mind was in darkness. Would
  he do it now? No. Neither would  the church now receive it. Why? Because the light
  of the temperance  reformation has burst forth.</p><p>  Christians! who have promised
  supreme obedience to Him, that :tasted death for  every man,: and more for the rich
  man, who, in a superb dress, rides in a  superb carriage, to a superb church, to
  worship in superb style, than for the  poor African, who pulls cotton in the “fields
  of Alabama, and naked as in the  hour of birth, trembles under the blasts of mid
  winter”—on you is this call  for a reformation in the church of that God, who declares
  himself no respector  [sic] of persons.—Why do you exclude the dealer in ardent
  spirits from the  communion table, and invite to it the dealer in human flesh? This
  could not,  would not be, if there had been half so much effort made to show the
  utter  abominations of christian slavery, as there has been to show the abominations  of
  christian drunkenness. Whatever maybe the event of slavery and intemperance  in
  the world a sufficiency of light will show, and cause to be removed  these&nbsp;
  shocking deformities of the christian church. One denomination has  already raised
  thousands of dollars to assist their brethren in becoming free  from the deep stains
  of this awful sin. When will other denominations be  equally sincere and active
  to cleanse themselves from this pollution? The  answer is plain. When they are as
  conscientious and as much enlightened.</p><p>  To have light poured on this subject
  as its importance demands, it is proposed  to raise fifty dollars, as a premium
  for the best essay on this deeply  interesting subject. When the church if pure,
  we may then expect the smiles  and approbation of heaven on our now almost divided
  land. And oh! May none  refuse their mite to reward the close application of time
  and talents to this  most vitally important theme; for it is believed the temperance
  reformation  commenced in this way.</p><p>  Donations will be received by the Editors
  of the Genius of Temperance, and the  Editor of the Emancipator, 126, Nassau street,
  A part of the money has already  been raised by a few ladies in Massachusetts. It
  is hoped that others, who are  opposed to slavery in the church of Christ, will
  speedily forward enough to  make it up to $50, when the sum will be given to him
  who shall show most  conclusively to the christian church and to christian ministers,
  their duty to  “Break every yoke.” The essays which shall be written for the prize,
  are to be  judged, and the premium awarded, by ________</p><p>[N.B.—The blank will
  be filled, when the money is subscribed.]</p>'
Scholarly Notes: Did this essay contest actually run?
Commentary: Charles Denison, editor of <em>The Emancipator</em>, and William Goodell
  of <em>The Genius of Temperance</em> were the two designated people to whom to send
  entries. Both were good friends of the cause and of the Canterbury Female Academy.
