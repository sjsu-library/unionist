  during the late<br>  War.<br></p><p>  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives,
  in General Assembly<br>  convened, That whenever the monies, or any part thereof,
  advanced by this<br>  State, for the defence thereof, during the war with Great-Britain,
  shall or<br>  may be received from the United States, it shall be the duty of the
  Treasurer<br>  of this State, in such form as he may prescribe, to give notice thereof
  to the<br>  several towns in this State; and the said monies, when so received,
  shall be<br>  and the same are hereby refunded to the people of this State, and
  shall be<br>  paid out to them as hereinafter provided.<br></p><p>  Sec. 2. Be it
  further enacted, that within thirty days next after the day on<br>  which said monies
  may be received, by the Treasurer of this State, it shall be<br>  the duty of said
  Treasurer to make an apportionment of said monies to and<br>  among all the towns
  which had been incorporated before the 20<br>  <sup>th</sup>  day of August, 1813,
  as made out and returned to the Comptroller of public<br>  accounts, giving to each
  of said towns a due proportion of said monies,<br>  according to said lists; and
  thereupon each and every town in this State,<br>  which hath not been divided since
  the 20<br>  <sup>th</sup>  day of August, 1813, and the local limits of which remain
  the same as on the<br>  said 20<br>  <sup>th</sup>  day of August, 1813, shall be
  entitled to draw from the Treasurer of this<br>  State, the amount of monies apportioned
  to such town; and the select-men<br>  thereof are authorized to draw an order for
  the same on the Treasurer of this<br>  state.<br></p><p>  Sec. 3. Be it further
  enacted, That in all those towns in this State, the<br>  local limits of which have
  been altered by the incorporation of any new town,<br>  or by taking from any town
  and adding the same to any other town, the<br>  select-men of said original town,
  together with the select-men of that town or<br>  those towns taken in part of in
  all from said original towns, shall within<br>  thirty days from the notice to be
  given by the Treasurer aforesaid, proceed to<br>  ascertain and apportion to such
  original town, and the town or towns taken<br>  from the same, the amount apportioned
  to said original town by said Treasurer,<br>  according to the list of August 20<br>  <sup>th</sup>  ,
  eighteen hundred and thirteen, having reference to inhabitants, and the<br>  location
  of estates on the 20<br>  <sup>th</sup>  day of August, 1813; and said apportionment,
  so made, shall be forthwith<br>  returned to the Treasurer of this State. And should
  the select-men of either<br>  of such towns refuse to make such apportionment, or
  should the select-men of<br>  said towns so divided, be unable to agree on such
  apportionment, it shall be<br>  the duty of the chief judge of the county court,
  within which the original<br>  town thus divided, or either of them, may be situated,
  to notify the towns<br>  interested to hear them, make out and return to the Treasurer
  of this State,<br>  as soon as may be, an appointment of such monies, according
  to the rule<br>  aforesaid; and thereupon the amount apportioned, as last aforesaid,
  shall be<br>  paid over to the towns to which the same shall be apportioned, as
  last<br>  aforesaid, and which may be incorporated at the time when such may be<br>  received;
  and the select-men thereon may draw an order on Treasurer of this<br>  State&nbsp;
  for the same.<br></p><p align="right">SAMUEL INGHAM,</p><p align="right">Speaker
