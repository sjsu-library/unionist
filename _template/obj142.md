  an account of a second trial of Miss Crandall before the Superior  Court of Connecticut,
  Judge Daggett on the bench. The charge on which she was  tried was for teaching
  colored people from other states. The Judge instructed  the jury that free people
  of color are not citizens, and that the law of  Connecticut is, therefore, not unconstitutional.
  The jury went out and after  an absence of 20 or 30 minutes, returned with a verdict
  of guilty. A bill of  exceptions was filed and the case put over to the Supreme
  Court of Errors, to  be holden at Brooklyn next July.</p><p>  On this singular decision
  we remark that if the case be so that free colored  people are not citizens of the
  United States, their condition is far worse  than we had supposed. But we canot
  believe this, the arguments in the decision  notwithstanding; and we cannot account
  for it that such a decision comes from  Judge Daggett, except on the supposition
  that strong feeling, excited in his  native place (New Haven), by an attempt to
  erect a similar school there some  time ago, has biased his judgment.</p><p>Judge
  Daggett says</p><p>  ‘Are the colored inhabitants of this country citizens? It is
  the opinion of  this court that they are not. Are slaves citizens of the U.S.? The
  \ constitution recognizes them only as the basis of representation and taxation.
  \ I refer to the definition of the word citizen as given by Mr. Webster, the  ablest
  philologist of this or any country. (The judge here read the several  definitions
  of the word as given in Webster’s dictionary, the last of which,  and the only one
  applicable to the case is as follows—“In the United States, a  person, native or
  naturalized, who has the privilege of exercising the  elective franchise, and of
  purchasing and holding real estate.”) Slaves, then,  are not citizens, in any of
  the state constitutions. Are Indians citizens? It  is difficult to say what they
  are, but they are not citizens. Kent, in his  commentaries, speaks of them as distinct
  tribes, living under the protection  of the government,—2 Kent, 70. Are the free
  people of color citizens? I  answer, No. They are not so styled in the Constitution
  of the United States,  or, so far as I am aware, in the laws of Congress or of any
  of the states. In  that clause of the constitution which fixes the basis of representation,
  there  was an opportunity to have called them citizens if they were so considered.
  \ But that makes free  <em>persons</em>  (adding three fifths of all other persons,)
  the basis of representation and  taxation.”</p><p>  “They” (the free people of color)
  are not so styled (citizens) in the  constitution of the United States.” What then?
  is it not implied? The  constitution does not so style free  <em>white</em>  persons,
  but does it not imply as much? Again, “I that clause which fixes the  basis of representation,
  there was an opportunity to have called them citizens  if they were so considered.”
  And so there was an opportunity to have called  free white people citizens. If the
  omission excludes the one from citizenship,  why not the other “But that (the constitution)
  makes free  <em>persons</em>  (adding three fifths of all other persons) the basis
  of representation and  taxation.” Now it seems to us that only two classes are here
  spoken of; first,  free persons, who, absolutely, form a basis, and next, slaves,
  only three  fifths of which form a basis. If then, the characteristic of forming
  a basis  for representation and taxation, entire, without division (five fifths
  of a  man and not three fifths) constitutes citizenship, by what logic is it  inferred
  that  <em>free</em>  colored persons are not citizens? The constitution it is true
  says nothing  about complexion, but does the omission therefore exclude free colored
  persons  If so can any one tell why it does not exclude free white persons?</p><p>
  \ Judge Daggett says, “another reason for believing that people of color were  not
  considered citizens is found in the fact&nbsp; that when the United States  constitution
  was adopted, every state except Massachusetts, tolerated  slavery.” We are dull—we
  do not see how this related to the point in question.</p><p>  It was argued in the
  Court, that free blacks own vessels which participate in  the peculiar privileges
  of American shipping, and that blacks may sue in the  United States courts. This
  was overruled on the ground that those points had  never been settled by judicial
  decisions. We suppose it is true that free  colored people have owned vessels, and
  participated in the peculiar privileges  of American shipping ever since the constitution
  was formed, that they have  also had suits in the U.S. Courts, and that they have
  received protections as  American Citizens from British impressment. And it seems
  incredible that this  should have gone of 57 years, unquestioned, if they were not
  in reality  American citizens.</p><p>  What aid the definition of Webster gives
  to the decision we do not see. “In  the United States (a citizen is) a person, native
  or naturalized, who has the  privilege of exercising the elective franchise, and
  of purchasing and holding  real estate.” Now in seven states the persons in question
  have the right of  the elective franchise, and in all the right of purchasing and
  holding  realestate. Does not the definition then make against the decision rather
  than  for it?</p><p>  In this decision also Judge Daggett has gone in the face of
  very high opinion.  In the Convention of New York for amending the constitution,
  on the motion to  insert the wiord  <em>white</em>  before the words “  <em>male
  citizens,”</em>  in the article relating to the right of suffrage, Peter A. Jay
  said, “Is not  the right of suffrage a privilege? Can you deny it to a  <em>citizen</em>
  \ of Pennsylvania, who comes here and complies with your laws, merely because he
  \ is not six feet high, or because he is of a dark complexion?’ Chancellor Kent
  \ said</p><p>  “Suppose a  <em>negro</em>  owning a freehold, and entitled to vote
  in Vermont, removes to this state, can  we constitutionally exclude him from the
  privilege of voting? The constitution  of the United States provides that  <em>citizens</em>
  \ of each State shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of  citizens
  of the several States.”</p><p>Rufus King said</p><p>  ‘Take the fact that a  <em>citizen
  of color</em>  entitled to all the privileges of a citizen, comes here—he purchases
  a  freehold—can you deny him the rights of an elector incident to his freehold?
  \ He is entitled to vote because like  <em>any other citizen</em>  he is a freeholder,
  and ever freeholder your laws entitle to vote.’</p><p>And again,</p><p>  “  <em>
  \   As certainly as the children of any white men are citizen, so certainly the
  \   children of black men are citizens.”  </em></p><p>Abram Van Vechten said,</p><p>
  \ ‘There is another and to my mind an insuperable objection to the exclusion of
  \ free citizens of color from the right of suffrage, arising from the provision
  \ of the Constitution of the U.S. that the citizens of each State shall be  entitled
  to all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several  States.’</p><p>
  \ In 1826 De Witt Clinton demanded of President Adams the release of ‘Gilbert  Horton
  a free man of color and a citizen of this state’ (New York) unlawfully  imprisoned
  in the District of Columbia, on the ground that he was ‘a free man  and a citizen.’</p><p>
  \ Wes cannot believe with Judge Daggett that the whole free colored population  of
  our country is outlawed, that emancipation confers as privilege but that of  rambling
  about. And we hope there is a higher appeal yet than the Supreme  Court of blinded
  Connecticut before which this case may be tried. We believe  the people of Canterbury
  and their abettors are heaping up for themselves a  load of odium, which they will
  find it difficult to bear.”</p>"
Scholarly Notes: 
Commentary: This appears to have content from William Jay's letter to Samuel May (see
  here) which arrived too late for the trial, but was likely included in 1:11 (October
  17) issue of <em>The Unionist</em>.
