transcription: '<p>  WHEREAS, attempts have been made to establish literary institutions
  in this<br>  State for the instruction of colored persons belonging to other states
  and<br>  countries, which would tend to the great increase of the colored population
  of<br>  the State, and thereby to the injury of the people: Therefore,<br></p><p>  Sec.
  1. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives, in General<br>  Assembly
  convened, That no person shall set up or establish in this State any<br>  school,
  academy, or literary institution, for the instruction or education of<br>  colored
  persons who are not inhabitants of this state, nor instruct or teach<br>  in any
  school, academy, or other literary institution whatsoever in this<br>  State, or
  harbor or board, for the purpose of attending or being taught or<br>  instructed
  in any such school, academy, or literary institution, any colored<br>  person who
  is not an inhabitant of any town in this state, without the<br>  consent, in writing,
  first obtained of a majority of the civil authority, and<br>  also of the selectmen
  of the town in which such school, academy, or literary<br>  institution is situated;
  and each and every person who shall knowingly do any<br>  act forbidden as aforesaid,
  or shall be aiding or assisting therein, shall,<br>  for the first offence, forfeit
  and pay to the treasurer of state, a fine of<br>  one hundred dollars, and for the
  second offence shall forfeit and pay a fine<br>  of two hundred dollars, and so
  double for every offence of which he or she<br>  shall be convicted. And all informing
  officers are required to make due<br>  presentment of all breaches of this act.<br>  <em>Provided</em>  ,
  That nothing in this act shall extend to any district school established in<br>  any
  school society, under the laws of this state, or to any school established<br>  by
  any school society under the laws of this state, or to any incorporated<br>  academy
  or incorporated school for instruction in this state.<br></p><p>  Sec. 2.<br>  <em>Be
  it further enacted</em>  , That any colored person, not an inhabitant of this state,
  who shall reside<br>  in any town therein for the purpose of being instructed as
  aforesaid, may be<br>  removed in the manner prescribed in the sixth and seventh
  sections of the act<br>  to which this is an addition.<br></p><p>  Sec. 3.<br>  <em>Be
  it further enacted,</em>  That any person, not an inhabitant of this state, who
  shall reside in any town<br>  therein, for the purpose of being instructed as aforesaid,
  shall be an<br>  admissible witness in all prosecutions under the first section
  of this act,<br>  and may be compelled to give testimony therein, notwithstanding
  any thing<br>  contained in this act, or the act last aforesaid.<br></p><p>  Sec.
  4.<br>  <em>Be it further enacts,</em>  That so much of the seventh section of the
  act to which this is an addition,<br>  as may provide for the infliction of corporeal
  punishment, be, and the same is<br>  hereby repealed.<br></p><p align="right">SAMUEL

scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: 'In reading the text of the actual Black Law carefully, one can observe
  that Judson and his allies substituted psychological coercion (sec. 3) for corporeal
  punishment (sec. 4). They did this knowing that any young free Black person would
  be under intense pressure to obey legal authority. While it was a standard practice
  for newspapers to republish legislative acts, what Charles Burleigh did here was
  place the Black Law, by which Crandall and the Canterbury Female Academy were being
  prosecuted, in the midst of the ''normal'' legislative activities. '
