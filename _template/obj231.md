transcription: On Tuesday afternoon, about 2 o’clock, the House of Miss Crandall,
  inCanterbury, was discovered to be on Fire, in a place and under circumstanceswhich
  render the origin of it inexplicable. The smoke and flame burst out frombetween
  the plastering and outer covering, in the corner of one of the frontrooms, farthest
  from the fire place. The inmates of the dwelling were very muchterrified, but with
  the assistance of the inhabitants of the village, soonextinguished the flames.—<em>Unionist</em>.
Scholarly Notes: 
Commentary: It is interesting that the <em>Norwich Courier</em> publisehd <em>The
  Unionist</em> account of the fire at the academy in January 1834.
