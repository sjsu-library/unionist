transcription: "<p>ACQUITTAL OF MR. OLNEY.</p><p>  ☞We are gratified to learn, by
  the last number of the Unionist, printed at<br>  Brooklyn, that Mr. Frederick Olney,
  a reputable and truly excellent citizen of<br>  Norwich, who was taken up by Andrew
  T. Judson &amp; Co. on a charge of having<br>  fired Miss Crandall’s dwelling a
  few weeks since, has been acquitted. The<br>  Unionist says—‘The Jury would probably
  have given their verdict without<br>  leaving their seats, if they had previously
  chosen a foreman. But so<br>  soon&nbsp; as they had returned to their room and
  organized, they gave a<br>  unanimous vote in his favor.’ The same paper gives a
  long report of the trial,<br>  which shows that a more paltry and vile attempt to
  incriminate an honest man<br>  was never made in our land.<br></p>"
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: "<em>The Liberator</em> reports on the acquittal of Olney, and takes a
  sentence from <em>The Unionist</em> coverage. "
