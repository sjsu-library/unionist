transcription: "<p>We cannot but admire the facility with which the Editor of the
  Advertiser disposes of his promises, which like the poets’ oaths,</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  “Are but words, and words but wind</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Too feeble instruments to bind.”</p><p>It is not every man that can make a promise
  Monday, and “revoke” it by the middle of the same week, but that faculty seems to
  belong in a rather eminent degree to our “courteous” neighbor. Nor is our admiration
  much less, when we notice his ingenious method of convincing those who, he thinks,
  doubt the correctness of his assertions. “I have a letter to show,” says the Editor.
  A “certain person” calls and requests a sight of it. Oh! I have lent it, but you
  shall see it when it is returned. The “person” relates the transaction just as it
  occurred, and without note or comment. “You doubt my word” exclaims the Advertiser,
  “you insinuate that I never had the letter, and now <em>you</em> shan’t see it.”
  Who can resist the conviction that he certainly had the letter, as he said.—Now
  we assure the Advertiser man that we have no desire to see the document if he does
  not wish it. And farther if it will afford him any consolation we will add, that
  it was never our intention to insinuate that it had not been in his possession,
  nor do we believe that our plain narrative contains any such insinuation.</p>"
