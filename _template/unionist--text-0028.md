transcription: It is a matter rather of sorrow than surprise to us, that our erudite
  neighbor should oppose a school at which English Grammar is taught. We would advise
  him rather to patronize one by a personal attendance a few weeks, and then we would
  request him to parse the following sentences. “Arthur Tappan together with Messrs
  Jocelyn, Benson &amp;c. have each paid us a visit.” “The Unionist has been circulated
  gratuitous.” “There <em>has</em> been twice the number of negroes <em>than</em>
  there <em>have </em>ever been before.” To aid him in analyzing the first sentence,
  we will transpose its members. Arthur Tappan have each paid us a visit; together
  with Messrs Jocelyn, Benson, &amp;c.
