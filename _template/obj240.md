transcription: "<p>  “We are in the midst of a revolution,” was the startling, and
  true as<br>  startling, declaration, with which Mr. Clay commenced his speech in
  the Senate<br>  some weeks ago. We are in the midst of a political revolution, which
  is<br>  silently but fatally sapping the principles of our free institutions, and<br>
  \ consolidating the whole action of the Government, into the will of the<br>  executive.
  “The President is far above the reach of anything said in this<br>  House,” said
  Mr Polk; and a passive House of Representatives—the people’s own<br>  House—hear
  without resenting the insolent assertion, and by their silence<br>  admit its truth.
  Yet the minister or favorite, who, on the floor of the<br>  English House of Commons,
  or of the French Chamber of Deputies, should hazard<br>  such a vaunt of the crowned
  monarchs of either of those realms, would be put<br>  to silence and to shame, by
  the indignant voices of men of<br>  <em>all</em>  parties. He would, in those<br>
  \ <em>limited monarchies</em>  be told that the king, like the humblest man in the
  kingdom, was the subject<br>  of the laws and the creature of opinion; and that
  it belonged not to him, or<br>  to any one for him, to claim exemption from that
  dependence upon the people’s<br>  representatives, ordained for the common good
  o all. In this<br>  <em>freest of republics,</em>  infallibility in judgement and
  in action; the right of constructing according<br>  to his own will all laws, and
  of dismissing at his own will all functionaries<br>  who see not with his eyes;
  and finally entire independence of the opinion of<br>  the Legislatures; are openly
  claimed for the Executive; and all who demur in<br>  the least to this sweeping
  claim, or who suggest that, even with the best<br>  motives, and the greatest caution,
  there may be error or mistake in some given<br>  act, are denounced as enemies to
  the “venerable President,” and forthwith<br>  trampled under foot as rebels and
  traitors—not to the country, or to<br>  freedom—but to<br>  <em>the</em>  party.
  We are then in the midst of a revolution, which is habituating us fast<br>  and
  fatally to disregard all those checks and balances which the wise<br>  contrivers
  of the Constitution, thought sufficient and availing, to secure the<br>  independence
  of each department in its proper sphere; and to look to the<br>  Executive head
  alone, as the fountain of all honor, profit and power. Nor is<br>  it to politics
  alone that the revolution is confined. In a country like this,<br>  where every
  citizen does, or may if he pleases, take a part in its public<br>  affairs, no great
  revolution in politics can be effected without a<br>  corresponding revolution in
  morals. Accordingly we find that the spirit of<br>  party, which now directs all
  its discipline and energy to sustain allegiance<br>  and devotion to the person
  of the President—be his measures what they<br>  may—infects the judgement or corrupts
  the principles of men on other subjects,<br>  and the recklessness with which conscience
  is outraged, in approving political<br>  measures, which in fact it disapproved—may
  come at last to pervert entirely<br>  the warning voice of that secret monitor.<br></p><p>
  \ It would seem the very “error of the moon” that men and doctrines such as<br>
  \ these we have this alluded to, should find a place and a bearing in the<br>  Legislative
  halls of a people so practical, and which flatters itself with<br>  being so enlightened,
  as ours—were it not that a sufficient earthly<br>  explanation is at hand in the
  cause we referred to in the outset of these<br>  remarks—the spirit of party—which,
  so that implicit and uncompromising<br>  obedience be rendered to its mandates,
  is little solicitous about any other<br>  qualifications, in the instruments it
  puts forth. Truly indeed did Mr Binney<br>  conclude, that the question now in issue
  in this country is, whether this<br>  “spirit of party” be not more fatal to free
  institutions here, than the spirit<br>  of despotism has proved elsewhere. Its inevitable
  tendency, at any rate, is to<br>  degrade, even though it may not wholly destroy;—and
  in that stage of the<br>  question, most certainly, this State now is.—<br>  <em>N.Y.
  American.</em></p><p></p>"
Scholarly Notes: 
Commentary: 'The quote from Henry Clay that begins this excerpt is a famous one, from
  his speech of December 26, 1833 introducing a motion to censure President Andrew
  Jackson. The entire speech was published in early 1834: <em>Speech of the Hon. Henry
  Clay, on the Subject of the Removal of the Deposites: Delivered in the Senate of
  the United States, December 26, 30, 1833</em> (Washington DC: Duff Green, 1834).
