  CONSIDERED.</p><p>Allowing what we are so continually boasting about, that more
  information is universally diffused among us than among any people on earth, and
  that all are at liberty to acquire knowledge to any extent, still it cannot be denied,
  that there is prevalent a great deal of ignorance on many subjects of paramount
  importance. It is nothing to the purpose—it is no consolation whatever to insist,
  that still we are superior in this respect to other communities. The only question
  for us to consider is—whether the people of this country have as much knowledge,
  as is indispensable to their temporal and eternal well-being—their social or individual
  happiness? Whether there is no need of earnestly reiterating every where among then
  the exhortation of the wise man “get wisdom, get understanding?”</p><p>I am well
  aware that much is <em>said</em> about the necessity of a general diffusion of knowledge
  to the preservation of our political constitution. But in respect to this point
  alone, I question if there be common among us a clear perception, and deep feeling
  of its importance. Else why is it that in many of our States scarcely any provision,
  and in some none whatever, is made for the instruction of youth; and that even in
  those States, which have long been applauded for the great number of their schools,
  a large proportion of these have ever been and still are inadequate to the purpose
  for which they were instituted. Though we have in New England much of the form of
  public education, the reality is generally wanting. Very few, in comparison with
  the whole number of those who attend our common schools, very few leave them possessed
  of those elements of good learning, which it is pretended are taught there. Very
  few indeed who can write their thoughts on any subject with propriety and ease;
  and not many more who can read the thoughts of others with facility and pleasure.
  Most that is really acquired at these schools, even by those who make the best use
  of the advantages afforded in them, is a sort of verbal acquaintance with three
  or four elementary sciences. They do not acquire there the use of the higher powers
  of mind—thinking, reasoning, judging—and our youth, excepting in the few instances
  of those who receive good instruction at home, go forth into the world, mingle in
  the collisions, and assume more or fewer of the offices of society without knowing
  how to distinguish between many things that differ essentially. They at once fall
  into the ranks of this party or that, and are content to swell the number of those,
  who cry out for one popular leader or another—for this system of measures or that.</p><p>Although
  we often hear it said, an every body concurs in the sentiment, that a federal republic
  cannot long&nbsp; be maintained unless the people generally are well informed, yet
  I ask what school, yes what single school can be named, where the great principles
  of civil government t are taught, and the peculiar characteristics of our Federal
  constitution. These, like all other great principles, are simple, and not hard to
  be understood, unless, the mind has been warped by a regard to sectional interests,
  or the schemes of a faction.—What young man of common sense might not easily be
  made, even before he leaves school, to understand these things perfectly? And if
  all young men were, as they should be, thus taught, moreover made to realize deeply
  their individual responsibilities as freemen, how difficult would it be to make
  them the creatures of a party, and to impose upon them as is continually done by
  factious men. But instead of this, how true it is, and sad as it is true, that most
  of our young men are left to learn all they are to know of political science, and
  of their own duties as members of a great Republic, amidst the contests of rival
  factions, and from those whose opinions have been warped by sectional interests
  and party passions.</p><p>Let it not be said, that I would impose upon the private
  citizen a degree of knowledge, which it can be needful only for pubic functionaries,
  or men of great influence in the community to possess. Let it not be objected, that
  I am urging the example even of a king upon every one, who hears me. Let it not
  be urged, that Solomon had a need of great wisdom which any of us have not; and
  that it is not worthwhile for all our young men to seek knowledge with as much ardor
  as he did, because only a few can rise to places of important trust. I say let not
  such sentiments be uttered, especially in this country. For is not the doctrine
  of hereditary right to rank utterly denounced among us? Are we not <em>all</em>
  born kings and princes as much as any one? Does not the supreme power emanate from
  ourselves? Are not <em>the people</em> the sovereign of the land?—Whom they will,
  they set up, and whom they will, they put down. And surely no one can foretell,
  which of our youth will hereafter be chosen by their fellow citizens to offices,
  the duties of which nothing less than the wisdom and understanding of Solomon would
  qualify them to discharge well.</p><p>As every man in the course of events may be
  called upon to serve the public, every man should qualify himself to do so in the
  best manner possible. But suppose that ninety out of a hundred of our youth may
  never be placed in office, be it remembered they are all to take a part in conferring
  offices; and this, though unhappily it is lightly esteemed, is a duty no less than
  a privilege of greatest moment. He is not fit to be a freeman, who does not hold
  his right of suffrage most sacred; too sacred to be prostituted to a party, not
  less than to the will of an individual usurper! He is not fit to have the right
  of suffrage, who does not hold his high prerogative in such esteem, that he will
  not exercise it but upon independent and rational conviction! And such a conviction
  cannot be formed in a mind that is unenlightened. Can any one deny that the more
  wisdom an individual may have, the more valuable he will be to the country, though
  he may never be known in public life?—If all our private citizens were as wise as
  Solomon, would it not be all the better for themselves and for the nation? Surely
  so! else are the fundamental principles of our civil constitution false!!</p>
