transcription: "<p>  How little do we appreciate a motherâ€™s tenderness while living!
  How heedless<br>  we are in youth of all her anxieties and kindness. But when she
  is dead and<br>  gone; when the cares and coldness of the world come withering to
  our hearts;<br>  when we find how hard it is to find true sympathy, how few love
  us for<br>  ourselves, how few will befriend us in our misfortunes; then it is we
  think of<br>  the mother we have lost.<br></p><p></p>"
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: While it would be easy to dismiss this as pious filler, it is a fact that
  Charles C. Burleigh ensured that his mother Lydia Bradford Burleigh would have a
  full obituary in <em>The Liberator</em>.
