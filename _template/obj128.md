transcription: "<em>Next Congress.</em>—The patriotic State of North Carolina will
  present an almost undivided phalanxat Washington next winter against Nullification.
  Carson is beaten, and there arebut two members chosen whose course will run side
  and side with McDuffie &amp;Co. More than two thirds of the Delegation are friendly
  to the re-charter of theBank. It gives us pleasure to learn that in the Fayetteville
  district,represented in the last Congress by Mr. Bethune, a semi-nullifier, the
  newmember is both in favor of the Bank and Mr. Clay’s Land Bill. It is remarkablethat
  Mr. Bethune was beaten by precisely the same majority that he was electedtwo years
  ago.—<em>Boston Atlas.</em>"
