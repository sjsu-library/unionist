transcription: The Unionist has devoted something over three columns to our humble
  self. Alabor which the Editor might have well spared as he has neither overturned
  anypositions of ours, or established those of his own. If he supposes that wedesired
  “to be excused” from further discussion by any fear of his doughty self,he may enjoy
  the illusion if it will afford him any pleasure—it was thefatherest thing from our
  thoughts at the time. He may rest assured that we haveno greater claim to the character
  of Goliah,[sic] than he has to that of David.He slings his stones too wide of his
  mark.
