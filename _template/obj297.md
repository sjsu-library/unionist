transcription: "<p>THE LIFE AND TRAVELS OF THE APOSTLE PAUL</p><p>  LILLY, Wait, &amp;
  Co. have just published a beautiful 18mo volume containing  272 pages, with the
  above title. It is furnished with questions, rendering it  suitable for use in Sunday
  schools. The work has undergone a careful revision,  by a clergyman of the Episcopal
  Church, residing in the western part of this  state, and may be considered a valuable
  addition to Sunday school literature.  We believe it will be acceptable to Christians
  generally, being free from  everything of a sectarian character. To the volume is
  prefixed a neat Map of  the countries traveled and the places visited by the Apostle.
  This map is on  red ground with white letters, a style of engraving which we have
  not before  seen in American books. It produces the best effect.</p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Boston,  Nov,  25.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
