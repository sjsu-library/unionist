transcription: "<p>THE LIFE AND TRAVELS OF THE APOSTLE PAUL</p><p>  LILLY, Wait, &amp;
  Co. have just published a beautiful 18mo volume containing<br>  272 pages, with
  the above title. It is furnished with questions, rendering it<br>  suitable for
  use in Sunday schools. The work has undergone a careful revision,<br>  by a clergyman
  of the Episcopal Church, residing in the western part of this<br>  state, and may
  be considered a valuable addition to Sunday school literature.<br>  We believe it
  will be acceptable to Christians generally, being free from<br>  everything of a
  sectarian character. To the volume is prefixed a neat Map of<br>  the countries
  traveled and the places visited by the Apostle. This map is on<br>  red ground with
  white letters, a style of engraving which we have not before<br>  seen in American
  books. It produces the best effect.<br></p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
