transcription: "<p>COMMUNICATIONS.</p><p>For the Unionist.</p><p>  MR. EDITOR—Old
  Plainfield is “redeemed, regenerated and disenthralled” from<br>  the degrading
  bondage of Jack-onism. “We have met the enemy and they are<br>  ours.” Last year
  we gave a majority for Pearl as Senator, and had besides the<br>  honor and felicity
  of being represented in the Assembly by one thorough-going,<br>  avowed Jacksonman
  and one who though not nominally a Jacksonian is said to<br>  have always acted
  with that party, with as much fidelity as if he had been one<br>  of them. Now you
  know, Mr. Editor, this shows a laudable contempt of party<br>  trannels, for certainly
  no one ought to refuse his support to good measures,<br>  merely because they are
  the measures of the opposite party, and if the<br>  measures of the opposite party
  happen to be<br>  <em>all</em>  right, why, they ought<br>  <em>all</em>  to be
  supported—and yet, you know, it would hardly be right even in that case<br>  for
  a man to<br>  <em>desert</em>  his own party. So we suppose our representative thought;
  but I did not sit<br>  down to tell you about last year, any more than just enough
  to give you a<br>  better idea of what we did this. Considerable activity was displayed
  by both<br>  sides in the electioneering campaign before hand. The Jackson recruiting<br>
  \ sergeants were flying about with great spirit, sensible, doubtless, that their<br>
  \ case being desperate required a desperate effort. And you may depend upon it,<br>
  \ our friends did not look on and see all the bustle of the Heroites with folded<br>
  \ hands and half closed eyes. They were awake and warning the honest people of<br>
  \ the tricks and maneuvres of the self-styled democratic party, and the people<br>
  \ needed only a word of caution to put them on their guard. The Jackson leaders,<br>
  \ after beating up for recruits, and counting noses all about town, came to the<br>
  \ conclusion, it seems, (and a pretty correct conclusion it was too,) that if<br>
  \ they attempted to run a full-blooded, acknowledged worshipper of their idol,<br>
  \ they should only run their head against a post, at the very first push; so<br>
  \ making up their minds that policy (not that which the old proverb calls “the<br>
  \ best policy” neither, for of that our Jackson leaders would be forced to say<br>
  \ as David did of the armor with which Saul girded him, “I have not assayed<br>
  \ it,”) must supply the place of strength, they pitched upon a worthy man whose<br>
  \ temper and disposition they considered such that they could mould him to about<br>
  \ the right shape when elected, but who has never been called a Jackson man, and<br>
  \ whom, in fact, they took care themselves to represent as no Jackson man, and<br>
  \ him they resolved to run for their first candidate. To make the trick work the<br>
  \ better, they took some pains to create an impression among the genuine<br>  republicans
  that this gentleman was to be one of the candidates of the<br>  republican party,
  hoping no doubt thereby to divide our ranks, and by uniting<br>  all the Jackson
  strength with a part of ours, to defeat our regular ticket,<br>  and thus dishearten
  us, and run with increased strength for their second<br>  candidate, who we shrewdly
  guessed would be the Chief Judge of our County<br>  Court—the same who was sent
  from our town last year. But though the plan was<br>  cunningly formed, and all
  preliminary measures taken with admirable skill,<br>  still somehow it wouldn’t
  work. Though some of the republicans—not aware<br>  probably of the plot—voted with
  the Jacksonians, yet the greater part were too<br>  wide awake to be managed in
  that sort, as the vote declared. For the first<br>  representative 287 votes were
  cast, of which Mr Goff, our candidate, received<br>  157, Mr. Cady, the<br>  <em>not
  Jackson</em>  candidate of the Jackson party, 74, Judge Eaton 2 or 3, and two of
  three<br>  others one apiece.<br></p><p>  This result was a damper, and as a natural
  consequence led them to relinquish<br>  the first order of battle, and instead of
  risking the Judge, to try their<br>  former candidate again; but some of the subalterns
  not getting their cue soon<br>  enough, had begun with commendable zeal to distribute
  votes for Mr. Eaton and<br>  had gone at least far enough to satisfy us what the
  original plan was, before<br>  they were stopped by the higher authorities. Not
  that the superior officers<br>  were at all negligent or remiss in checking the
  well meant, but ill judged<br>  activity of their less prudent partizans as soon
  as they discovered what was<br>  going on, for I chanced to see one of them, an<br>
  \ <em>illustrious</em>  member of the bar, as well as sharer in some small degree
  of the “spoils” of<br>  former campaigns, stepping about quite nimbly and giving
  the necessary orders<br>  to restore, as far as possible, that union which they
  had like to have lost by<br>  their own maneuvres. The result of the over forward
  promptitude of the<br>  subalterns appeared on counting the votes for a second representative,
  when it<br>  was found that 238 had been case—153 for Mr. Knight, our candidate,
  —62 for<br>  Mr. Cady, and some dozen or twenty or such a matter for Mr. Eaton.<br></p><p>
  \ The votes for Senator, Governor &amp;c. exhibited a still more cheering<br>  result,
  but as you will probably insert them at length, I shall add nothing<br>  respecting
  them, except that I was pleased to see how the freeman stood at<br>  their posts
  instead of quitting as they too often do, immediately on the<br>  choice of representatives.
  This appears from the number of votes given for<br>  each officer. First Representative
  237, second do. 233, Senator 235, Governor<br>  237. I have already told you how
  the Jacksonites carried matters last year,<br>  and I will add that by referring
  to the Presidential vote in 1832, I find that<br>  Jacksonism has sustained a net
  loss in this town since that time, of about 60<br>  votes.<br></p><p>  (<br>  <em>signed</em>
  \ ) PLAINFIELD REPUBLICAN<br></p>"
