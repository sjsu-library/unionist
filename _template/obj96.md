transcription: We are told in the last Advertiser, that the counsel for Miss Crandall
  in therecent trial, “spoke like men who were paid for it,” but that Messrs. Judson
  andWelch “spoke<em>“con amore.”</em>If Messrs. Ellsworth and Strong argue so powerfully
  and conclusively merely forpay, what, we may well ask,<em>would they do</em>if they
  should speak<em>“con amore.</em>” We have no wish to underrate the merits of the
  counsel for the prosecution; wedoubt not they did their best. The gentleman who
  closed we would allude to inparticular as having displayed ability and ingenuity
  worthy of a better cause.True we could not but think he in some instances approached
  nearer to coarsness[sic] and vulgarity than was altogether seemly under existing
  circumstances, butconsidering he was “trammeled by a bad cause,” he certainly acquitted
  himselfvery creditably. But were we desirous of eulogizing him and his colleague,
  wewould not accuse them of arguing such a cause<em>“con amore”</em>or represent
  them as having on that occasion exhibited “logical precision, andelegance of language
  unusual even to themselves.”
