transcription: "“She was in her own house, and as we suppose in her native State,
  using her ownproperty, talents and time for the noblest purposes, according to the
  sentimentsof President Dwight, which we lately published in this paper. For this
  christianand noble employment, she is taken by the violent hand of persecution andconfined
  in a prison. What were the complaints and censures against Georgia, forsimilar conduct
  towards the imprisoned missionaries? Is such conduct inNew-England, in Connecticut,
  less sinful, shameful, unjust and cruel? Whoselife, liberty and pursuit of happiness
  are safe, if a christian lady is exposedto imprisonment for obedience to the dictates
  of her conscience and the evidentrequirements of piety, patriotism and philanthropy?”"
