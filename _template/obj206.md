transcription: "<p>TO THE MEMORY OF CHARLES B. STORRS,</p><p><em>Late President of
  Western Reserve College.</em></p><p>BY JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER.</p><p>  ‘He fell
  a martyr to the interests of his  <em>colored brethren.</em>  For many months did
  that might man of God apply his discriminating and  gigantic mind to the subject
  of Slavery and its Remedy; and, when his sould  cou’d no longer contain his holy
  indignation against the upholders and  apologists of this unrighteous system, he
  gave vent to his aching heart, and  poured forth his clear throughs and holy feelings
  in such deep and  soul-entrancing eloquence, that other men, who he would fain in
  his humble  modesty acknowledge his superiors, sat at his feet and looked up as
  children  to a parent.’—  <em>Correspondent of the ‘Liberator,’ 16</em>  <em><sup>th</sup></em>
  \ <em>of 11</em>  <em><sup>th</sup></em>  <em>Mo.</em>  1833.</p><p>  Thou hast
  fallen in thine armor—  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp; Thou martyr of the Lord!—  <br />  With
  thy last breath crying—'Onward!'  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp; And thy hand upon the sword.
  \ <br />  The haughty heart derideth,  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp; And the sinful lip reviles,
  \ <br />  But the blessing of the perishing  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp; Around thy pillow
  smiles!  <br />  <br />  When to our cup of trembling  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp; The
  added drop is given—  <br />  And the long-suspended thunder  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp;
  Falls terribly from Heaven,—  <br />  When a new and fearful freedom  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp;
  Is proffered of the Lord  <br />  To the slow-consuming Famine—  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp;
  The Pestilence and Sword!—  <br />  <br />  When the refuges of Falsehood  <br />
  \ &nbsp;&nbsp; Shall be swept away in wrath,  <br />  And the temple shall be shaken,
  \ <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp; With its idol, to the earth, —  <br />  Shall not thy words
  of warning  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp; Be all remembered then?—  <br />  And thy now unheeded
  message  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp; Burn in the hearts of men? —  <br />  <br />  Oppression's
  hand may scatter  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp; Its nettles on thy tomb,  <br />  And even
  Christian bosoms  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp; Deny thy memory room;—  <br />  For lying
  lips shall torture  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp; Thy mercy into crime,  <br />  And the
  slanderer shall flourish  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp; As the bay-tree for a time.  <br
  />  <br />  But where the South-wind lingers  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp; On Carolina's
  pines,—  <br />  Or falls the careless sunbeam  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp; Down Georgia's
  golden mines;—  <br />  Where now beneath his burthen  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp; The
  toiling slave is driven;—  <br />  Where now a tyrant's mockery  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp;
  Is offered unto Heaven;—  <br />  <br />  Where Mammon hath its altars  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp;
  Wet o'er with human blood,  <br />  And pride and lust debases  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp;
  The workmanship of God,—  <br />  There shall thy praise be spoken,  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp;
  Redeemed from Falsehood's ban,  <br />  When the fetters shall be broken,  <br />
  \ &nbsp;&nbsp; And the slave shall be a  <em>man</em>  !  <br />  <br />  Joy to
  thy spirit, brother!—  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp; A thousand hearts are warm,—  <br />
  \ A thousand kindred bosoms  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp; Are baring to the storm.  <br
  />  What though red-handed Violence  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp; With secret Fraud combine?
  \ <br />  The wall of fire is round us,—  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp; Our Present Help
  was thine.  <br />  <br />  Lo, the waking up of nations,  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp;
  From Slavery's fatal sleep;—  <br />  The murmur of a universe,—  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp;
  Deep calling unto deep!—  <br />  Joy to thy spirit, brother!—  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp;
  On every wind of heaven  <br />  The onward cheer and summons  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp;
  OF FREEDOM’S SOUL is given!  <br />  <br />  Glory to God forever!—  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp;
  Beyond the despot's will  <br />  The soul of Freedom liveth  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp;
  Imperishable still.  <br />  The words which thou hast uttered  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp;
  Are of that soul a part,  <br />  And the good seed thou hast scattered  <br />
  \ &nbsp;&nbsp; Is springing from the heart.  <br />  <br />  In the evil days before
  us,  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp; And the trials yet to come—  <br />  In the shadow of
  the prison,  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp; Or the cruel martyrdom—  <br />  We will think
  of thee, O Brother!  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp; And thy sainted name shall be  <br />
  \ In the blessing of the captive,  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp; And the anthem of the free.</p>"

Commentary: 'Charles Backus Storrs (1794-1833) was the first President of Case-Western
  Reserve University in Cleveland. This poem can also be found on Poem Hunter: https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/to-the-memory-of-charles-b-storrs/
  . In addition to the poetic memorial from Whittier, there is this account from Henry
  Wilson of Storrs'' deathbed testimony: "Rev. Amos A. Phelps of Massachusetts earnestly
  supported the resolution. He referred in words of tender eulogy to the Rev. Charles
  B. Storrs, late president of the Western Reserve College, who had recently died
  at Braintree, Massachusetts. He stated that Mr. Storrs, while lying on his death-bed,
  requested that a pen should be placed in his hands, that he might affix his name
  to a declaration of antislavery principles about to be issued. "He commenced," said
  Mr. Phelps, “tracing his name, and had written the first word, ''Charles,'' when
  he discovered that two of the letters had been transposed. Letting the pen fall,
  and turning to his brother, standing by, he exclaimed, with an energy peculiar to
  him: ''I can write no more: Brother, do you finish my name. Those principles are
  eternal truth. They cannot be shaken. I wish to give to them my dying testimony.''"
  Mr. Phelps expressed the opinion that the death of President Storrs had been hastened
  by over-exertion in delivering an address of great vigor and power of more than
  two hours in length, in behalf of the slave. Mr. Storrs was a gentleman of high
  promise and scholarship, of Christian principle and earnest philanthropy, in whose
  untimely death freedom lost one of its earliest and ablest champions. The touching
  scene at his death-bed is one among the evidences that the antislavery struggle
  in this country was born of a zeal and heroic devotion to principle which finds
  not many parallels in the world''s history" (“National Antislavery Convention at
  Philadelphia: Organization of the American Antislavery Society,” by Henry Wilson,
  in <em>History of the Rise and Fall of the Slave Power in America</em>, 1872, accessed
