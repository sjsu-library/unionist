  Ellsworth, after stating the case, and remarking on the prohibitions of the<br>  law,
  said that he proposed not to occupy time in relation to the facts of the<br>  case.
  He would willingly have advised the pupils of Miss Crandall to have<br>  testified
  had he not believed that in so doing they voluntarily surrendered<br>  their most
  sacred rights. True it was, the defendant has kept this<br>  school—‘twas no secret,
  and whether that constituted a crime or not was for<br>  the jury to determine.
  In order to convict my client, said Mr.E., you,<br>  gentlemen, must find on your
  oaths that she has committed a crime. You may<br>  find that she has violated an
  act of the State legislature, but if you also<br>  find her protected by a higher
  power, it will be your duty to acquit. The<br>  court he was fully assured, would
  charge the jury that the law was<br>  unconstitutional, I they so believed, but
  after all, it belonged to the people<br>  to determine whether one of them had been
  guilty of a crime. Each one of the<br>  jury must be satisfied for himself alone,
  that a crime has been committed. He<br>  flattered himself that he should be able
  to lead them to the conclusion that<br>  the law in question was a violation of
  the constitution of this State and of<br>  the United States.—The constitution of
  the United States was the highest power<br>  known in our land. Beyond that, no
  Legislature can go, and if the jury find<br>  the law not to stand well with the
  constitution they must say so.<br></p><p>  The real question for the jury to settle
  Mr Ellsworth apprehended to be this:<br>  Can the Legislature of Connecticut pass
  a law prohibiting the citizens of<br>  other States from coming into this State,
  and there residing, to prosecute the<br>  acquisition of knowledge, in a way open
  to the citizens of this State. This he<br>  believed was the precise question, and
  it reached deep and wide—wider and<br>  deeper than was perhaps imagined. It was
  however claimed by his friend from<br>  Canterbury, that colored persons were not
  citizens, and that the provisions of<br>  the constitution, with respect to citizens
  of the United States, did not apply<br>  to this class of our population. The criterion
  of citizenship was complexion,<br>  in the view of the gentleman who had preceded
  him. I, said Mr E., make the<br>  criterion to be either birth or naturalization.
  Admitting that none but white<br>  persons can be naturalized, it does not touch
  the question of citizenship by<br>  birth. Is it so that a person born on our soil,
  is not a citizen of our soil?<br>  In the days of Revolution, said Mr E., these
  men fought side by side with our<br>  fathers, and shed their blood for this country,
  which as their country—the<br>  country to which they owed indefeasible allegiance.
  Their names were no<br>  inscribed on the Pension Rolls of the Government—they now
  received the<br>  honorable trophies of the services they had rendered. Where, said
  Mr E., does<br>  the gentleman get the doctrine that the rights of man, as a citizen,
  depend<br>  upon his color? A colored man could appeal to the laws for the protection
  of<br>  his rights in every State; could he, if he were not a citizen? (Mr. E. here<br>  read
  a few sentences from the commencement of the declaration of independence,<br>  which,
  he said, according to the argument of the gentleman opposed to him,<br>  ought to
  be changed so as to have the words “except black people” introduced<br>  between
  each clause). Mr E. said he was a republican, he claimed to be as much<br>  of a
  republican as his friend from Canterbury, and he hoped that his friend<br>  was
  not so ashamed of his republicanism, as to wish this instrument, the<br>  Declaration
  of Independence, interpolated in this manner. Our own<br>  constitution, continued
  Mr E., recognized, in express terms, equality of<br>  rights—that men were equal
  in rights, but to this the gentleman would add<br>  “except black men.” He hoped
  he should not live long enough to see such<br>  doctrine go forth from Connecticut.
  The free colored population has, and is<br>  justly entitled, to equal representation
  in the Congress of the United States<br>  with the white population. Could not a
  black man commit treason? The gentleman<br>  would have it that he could not, for
  none other than citizens can. Mr E. here<br>  read from the 2d Kent’s Com. on the
  subject of citizenship, by birth.) I scout<br>  the Idea, said Mr E., that a man,
  born here by the side of me, is not a<br>  citizen because, his father was black,
  while I am a citizen because mine was<br>  white.<br></p><p>  Mr E. said that the
  argument which his friend had drawn from the fact that our<br>  state constitution
  provided that none but white citizens should become<br>  electors, would seem to
  be based on the assumption that the right of voting<br>  was a criterion of citizenship.
  Is this, he asked, the fact? Was the right of<br>  voting a test of citizenship?
  If it is, where are our wives and daughters?<br>  Citizens, or not? Would the gentleman
  denationalize them? How could persons<br>  born here be aliens? Mr E. then proceeded
  to examine more minutely the<br>  abstract question which he had before stated.
  It was, he said, a great<br>  question, one which he had not doubt would make a
  figure in the future history<br>  of this country. If, said Mr E., resident citizens
  of this state may choose<br>  their own instructors, then, he believe, that citizens
  from other states, here<br>  by their sides, may also choose theirs. If the Legislature
  of Connecticut can<br>  say to a black citizen of New York that he shall not come
  here to be<br>  instructed he may say so to the white citizen. Where is the distinction?
  It<br>  comes then to this, our Legislature can say as to the population of an<br>  adjacent
  state, for instance New York, it is corrupt, and its citizens shall<br>  not come
  within our limits—be they white or black it makes no difference. A<br>  barrier
  was thus at once erected around our state. An absurdity so manifest as<br>  this
  must strike every mind. Nothing but a high state of excitement could ever<br>  have
  caused the enactment of such a law as the present. The citizens of<br>  Canterbury
  he had no doubt, would, on reflection, perceive the impropriety of<br>  their course.
  The care and supervision which the Legislature had exercised<br>  over schools in
  this state did not, as Mr E. apprehended imply the right to<br>  exercise any such
  power as that set up in the new law.<br></p><p>  The law, which regulate trades
  and professions, to which allusion has been<br>  made, were also, he said, of an
  entirely different character. These<br>  regulations and restrictions, it must be
  remembered, were the same for all.<br>  Whether one belonged to the state or not,
  these laws knew no difference. The<br>  new law has made a difference, and in that
  consisted the difficulty. The<br>  application of the new law must depend upon the
  fact whether a person was born<br>  in or out of the state. The Legislature leave
  the black man born here, the<br>  freedom of selecting his own instructor, and the
  place of instruction for his<br>  child. This privilege is denied to the black man
  who comes here, if it so<br>  happens that he was born out of the state. But, says
  the gentleman, his<br>  children may go to the district schools, to any of the high
  schools of<br>  academies in the state. The benefits which colored children would
  derive from<br>  these schools, said Mr E. would not be worth a pinch of snuff,
  and the<br>  gentleman knows it.—The blacks in Hartford had petitioned for a separate<br>  school,
  in order that they might have the benefit of the public money, which<br>  they did
  not enjoy now, as they were ever made hewers of wood and drawers of<br>  water,
  and considered the offscouring of the schools which they attended. They<br>  made
  commotion in every school the moment they entered it. There existed then<br>  a
  necessity for separate schools.—He was not going abreast of any principle of<br>  supervision
  which the state could properly exercise over schools, or over<br>  trades and professions,
  by contending for the rights of citizens to choose<br>  their own instructors, and
  the place of instruction, for their children,<br>  whether they were or were not
  citizens of this state. The old statute in<br>  relation to paupers was considered
  as upholding this law. By it, persons<br>  liable to become chargeable might be
  warned to depart, and might be publicly<br>  whipped if they did not obey the mandate.
  He would here thank his friend from<br>  Canterbury for obtaining a repeal of that
  portion of the law by which whipping<br>  was imposed. Mr E. apprehended that a
  state possessed the power of preventing<br>  the settlement, within its limits,
  of those likely to become paupers, but that<br>  the state had the power of keeping
  out very body from other states, he denied<br>  altogether. Will it be said that
  the law in question does not go this extent?<br>  If a citizen of Massachusetts
  may come into this state and settle down, what<br>  is he here for? Must he be a
  drone? What is the privilege of moving worth to<br>  him? Citizens of other states
  may come here and become farmers, or lawyers,<br>  (that would be a poor business,
  said Mr E.) or doctors. They may, when here,<br>  said Mr E. do what citizens here
  may do, or the constitution is not worth a<br>  rush. ‘Twas claimed that blacks
  might come here and go to other schools. Might<br>  not the Legislature then say
  to them, and to all others, you shall send your<br>  children to the Presbyterian
  school—to the Baptist school, or to the Methodist<br>  school? Might not the Legislature
  further say, we do not like Roman Catholics,<br>  and we will therefore have no
  school where Catholics instruct? Gentlemen must<br>  go this length, who advocate
  this law. Would it be claimed that the fact of<br>  putting this power in the hands
  of the select men to exercise, made any<br>  difference? This was a mere parade
  of liberality—the select men of Canterbury<br>  would sooner shed their blood than
  grant Miss Crandall permission to keep this<br>  school. The power to license, said
  Mr E., is a power to deny—and we are to<br>  hold our most sacred rights and privileges
  at the pleasure of the select men;<br>  they can grant or they can prohibit.<br></p><p>  Mr
  E. now proceeded to consider the rights which citizens of each state are<br>  entitled
  to enjoy in the several states. He read from the opinion of Judge<br>  Washington,
  as reported in the 4<br>  <sup>th</sup>  of Washington’s Circuit Court Reps. page
  380, which he claimed showed<br>  conclusively that the new law of Connecticut was
  unconstitutional. He also<br>  maintained that the views he took of this law were
  supported by Judge Story,<br>  in the third volume of his recent work on the Constitution
  and also in<br>  Sergeant’s Constitutional law, page 385. The legislation of Congress
  on the<br>  subject of the Missouri question, he claimed distinctly recognized blacks
  as<br>  Citizens. The law when it says that no person shall keep a school for the<br>  instruction
  of blacks from abroad, says, in effect, that no foreign person<br>  shall come here
  and be taught—How were they to be taught without a teacher?<br>  This law would
  extinguish the light of knowledge—would degrade those who are<br>  now degraded,
  and depress those who are now depressed. It said to the naked,<br>  go unclothed,
  and to the hungry, go unfed. The distinctions which now existed<br>  on account
  of color were sufficiently great—the colored people had now<br>  difficulties enough
  to struggle with—he hoped they would not be increased.<br></p><p>  The general policy
  of this law, continued Mr E., and its connexion with the<br>  subject of slavery,
  though a question touching deep feelings, cannot, without<br>  impropriety, be discussed
  here. Had he been a member of the legislature that<br>  enacted it, he might have
  said something on the subject, but should refrain<br>  from it on the present occasion.<br></p><p>  In
  conclusion, Mr. Ellsworth thanked the jury for the attention they had paid<br>  to
  his remarks, which, he said, were quite unsatisfactory to himself. He hoped<br>  they
  would see their way clear, before they found his client guilty of a crime<br>  for
  endeavoring to elevate and enlighten an unfortunate portion of our race.<br>  Were
  they prepared to say that teaching the word of God was a crime? That it<br>  was
  a crime to teach children the Bible? He left the case with them. He<br>  trusted
  that the court would tell them that the law was unconstitutional, but<br>  if they
  should not, my appeal, said Mr E., is to THE PEOPLE, and to THE PEOPLE<br>  I leave
  my client.<br></p><p>  Mr. Strong said that after the very full, and eloquent, and
  conclusive<br>  argument of his brother Ellsworth, it would be more grateful to
  his feelings to<br>  leave the case in the hands of the jury without adding a word.
  He feared that<br>  he should rather diminish than add to the force of that argument.
  He however<br>  found an apology for occupying a short time, in the magnitude of
  the<br>  case under consideration. It involves the liberties of the people.<br></p><p>  Those
  who advocate the cause of the defendant, said Mr. S., are charged with<br>  endeavoring
  to nullify the laws. What is nullification? An attempt by the<br>  Legislature of
  a state, to destroy a power higher than itself. South Carolina<br>  had done this
  to the fullest extent—our own state had made some progress, but<br>  the right of
  trial by jury was still left us. A culprit is here arraigned—a<br>  female—by the
  courtesy of the court she had not been called upon to hold up<br>  her hand, and
  plead to the information against her, but she nevertheless stood<br>  there as a
  criminal. She was charged with giving instruction, but there was no<br>  pretence
  that she has inculcated bad principles. He had heard of a land where<br>  this might
  be criminal, but it was a land where despots reigned. Her crime<br>  consisted in
  this, that she had given light to those who were in mental<br>  darkness—had taught
  those who were ignorant, to read the bible. It was true<br>  that the persons to
  whom she had given instruction were descendants of that<br>  unfortunate race, who
  were even in a state of slavery in this country. He said<br>  this not to their
  reproach, but to our own. He rejoiced that public sentiment<br>  had changed on
  the subject—but one feeling now exists &amp; that was not<br>  peculiar to our own
  country. The Legislature of Great Britain was engaged in<br>  passing a law of a
  very different character from the one now in question, at<br>  the very time that
  our Legislature passed this. Even in a country where a king<br>  and nobles constituted
  one branch of the legislature, a law had been passed,<br>  almost simultaneously
  with our own, strikingly dissimilar in its provisions.<br>  We complained that this
  class of persons were low, degraded, and addicted to<br>  crime. Has God made them
  so, or have they been made so by ignorance? ‘Twas a<br>  little boon to give them
  liberty, and keep them in ignorance. Better to rivet<br>  the chains of slavery,
  then to break those and rivet again the chains of<br>  ignorance. But one sentiment
  now pervaded the people of this country, with<br>  respect to educating these people—there
  was a difference as to the way. Some<br>  were for colonizing them, others had different
  views, but all agreed they<br>  ought to be instructed in some way. If they were
  carried out of the country in<br>  ignorance, was it not carrying them away that
  they might destroy themselves.<br>  Unless education accompanied them all was in
  vain. What, asked Mr. S., has<br>  been the course pursued by the defendant? He
  rejoiced that her pupils had been<br>  before the jury, and that they had had opportunities
  of seeing them. Were they<br>  not worthy of being instructed? Had not the defendant
  entirely deferred to<br>  public sentiment, in relation to keeping the races separate?
  What more<br>  feasible course for educating these people could be point out, than
  the one<br>  she had adopted? The colored race could not educate themselves—unless
  some<br>  person would step forward and overcome these prejudices, whether rightful
  or<br>  not, he should not decide, they must ever live in ignorance.<br></p><p>MR.
  STRONG, next proceeded to remark on the law.</p><p>  He read the preamble and said
  it put him in mind of the painter, who affixed a<br>  label to his pictures, lest
  the spectators might not otherwise be able to<br>  determine what animal he intended
  to delineate. The question, continued Mr S.,<br>  is often asked, :would you be
  willing to have a school of this description in<br>  your own neighborhood?” What
  if we should not, could we put it down by passing<br>  an unconstitutional law?
  What if I did not wish my neighbor to keep a large<br>  number of dogs, could I
  of course compel him to put them away? This law does<br>  not prevent colored persons
  from coming to this State. They may come and be<br>  idle, and welcome—they may
  come for any earthly purpose except education. That<br>  they are told they must
  get in the district schools. In these schools, the<br>  colored class sit on the
  lowest bench. They cannot go to these schools—as soon<br>  as their minds become
  a little expanded, they must retire from them. He wished<br>  to have an instance
  pointed out where any black had continued to attend, for<br>  any length of time,
  and derived benefit. It was impossible that such should be<br>  the case as things
  now were. What they desired was a school by themselves,<br>  where, and only where,
  they could acquire an education. They asked of us<br>  bread, but we gave them a
  stone—they asked a fish, but we gave them a<br>  scorpion—there was the sting of
  reproach in it. We place our foot on the<br>  black, and hold him down in the dust,
  and then complain that he does not grow<br>  to the perfect stature of a man. There
  was but one Academy in the State where<br>  they could be admitted at all, and this
  was by the munificence of a private<br>  individual—he alluded to the late Mr Bacon
  of Colchester. He should have<br>  supposed by the argument of the gentleman who
  opened the case for the<br>  prosecution, that the new act would open the doors
  [of] every academy and<br>  college in the State. The proviso in the law amounted
  to nothing—it might as<br>  well have provided that nothing in that act should be
  construed to prevent<br>  colored persons from holding all the Bank stock in the
  State. The act exposed<br>  one to penalties who should instruct a colored person,
  from another State, in<br>  a sabbath school. It compelled us to obtain a license
  to seek out the poor,<br>  the ignorant, the destitute, and the benighted.<br></p><p>  It
  is claimed, said Mr S., that the legislature have the power to regulate<br>  schools—be
  it so. He asked however to be pointed to an instance where the<br>  regulation depended
  on the character of the scholar. This law excluded those<br>  whom it pronounced
  bad. He would say, let all be instructed, particularly the<br>  bad that they might
  be made better. He spoke however with confidence, when he<br>  said, that no law
  had ever existed, in this State, to regulate private school.<br>  (Mr S. then read
  from some of the ancient statutes, regulating schools,<br>  appointing inspectors,
  &amp;c.) The legislature, continued Mr S., regulated<br>  these schools because
  they had established them, and they undoubtedly might do<br>  so. Was this power
  claimed in order to prevent bad principles from being<br>  taught? He did not perceive
  that the defendant had offended in this respect.<br>  There was nothing had in teaching
  arithmetic, geography, grammar, and the<br>  bible. If this however was the object
  of the law, whom did it protect? Our own<br>  citizens? No—we might teach them every
  thing naughty that we chose, but were<br>  restrained from doing so to those who
  came from abroad. This, said Mr S., is<br>  really the most<br>  <em>diffusive</em>  kind
  of benevolence I ever heard of. Most of our criminal laws, continued Mr<br>  S.,
  gives the court some discretionary power in imposing punishment, in this<br>  law
  the penalty is fixed, if the law itself be not fixed—if it be not pierced<br>  by
  the spear which emanated from the constitution. All public officers are<br>  sworn
  to support the constitution of the United States, and if any law<br>  interferes
  with that, it must be disregarded—otherwise they would incur the<br>  guilt of perjury.
  Whether any of the jury had taken this oath, he knew not,<br>  nor was it material
  to his argument. The Constitution of the United States was<br>  the supreme law,
  and must be regarded by all citizens, whether public officers<br>  or not. He meant
  to speak with all respect of the opinion of the Court, and<br>  though in civil
  matters the jury were bound to take the law as given from the<br>  Bench, it was
  otherwise in criminal questions. Here the Court advise, and the<br>  jury decide.<br></p><p>  He
  intended no disrespect to the legislature which enacted this law, by the<br>  animadversions
  which he made concerning it. It was notorious that public<br>  feeling frequently
  exercised a strong influence in regard to the passage of<br>  laws. As an instance
  of this, he would refer to a law passed a few years since<br>  in this State, called
  the Steam-boat law. In this law, we cut off many of our<br>  privileges for the
  sake of retaliating on the State of New-York. The law was<br>  passed by acclamation.
  Gov. Wolcott sent a sensible well written message to<br>  the legislature, suggesting
  its impolicy and unconstitutionality, but it was<br>  no more regarded than if he
  had sent a page of the spelling book—it did not<br>  change a vote. The Dartmouth
  College case was another instance of the passage<br>  of a State law, in time of
  high excitement. Again and again had our sacred<br>  constitution been called to
  exert its conservative principle.<br></p><p>  Mr S. said that it was with some surprise
  that he had listened to the<br>  statement of the opening Counsel for the prosecution,
  as to the law of<br>  Pennsylvania, relating to the residence of blacks in their
  limits. What the<br>  gentleman asserted to be the law of that State, which he had
  so properly<br>  styled “the land of Penn,” was a bill reported to the legislature,
  but never<br>  passed into a law. Other bills had been framed and prepared to pass,
  in other<br>  legislatures, which Mr S. apprehended would form a miscellaneous collection.<br>  It
  would greatly gratify his curiosity, could he get a sight of some of them.<br>  It
  was no reflection on the character of our State, that under excitement, it<br>  had
  passed an unconstitutional law—other States had done the same. Mr S. here<br>  referred
  to the second section of the 4<br>  <sup>th</sup>  Article of the constitution,
  on which he said he relied to prove the<br>  unconstitutionality of the law. He
  also read from the articles o<br>  confederation, which he claimed to contain a
  similar provision. By the<br>  adoption of the constitution, we were, said Mr S.,
  made one people. ‘Twas<br>  necessary—‘twas the principle of the proclamation of
  Gen. Jackson, so<br>  deservedly popular throughout this section of the Country.
  If this principle<br>  was impugned, it destroyed that which alone made our government
  worth<br>  anything. (Mr. S. also read from Judge Story what had before been quoted
  by Mr<br>  Ellsworth) In ancient times, continued Mr S., it was a proud boast—“I
  am a<br>  Roman citizen.” A citizen of the United States was entitled to one no
  less<br>  proud—I am an American citizen. We were not to say that we were citizens
  of<br>  Connecticut, but that we were American citizens. A portion of our country
  men<br>  might wish to raise the Palmetto banner, but the eagle and the stripes
  were<br>  our badge. The attorney for the prosecution would improve upon the<br>  Nullification
  of South Carolina. That State had only to pass an act excluding<br>  the standing
  army o the United States from her territory, and the principles<br>  of the old
  General’s proclamation were all nullified, or Mr S. was greatly<br>  mistaken. Were
  blacks citizens? The term “citizen” was to have a technical<br>  sense. He had listened
  with pleasure to this remark from the gentleman who<br>  opened the case, for when
  a word has a technical signification, it was always<br>  easy to get its precise
  meaning. All the technics however which seemed to<br>  attach to the word were that
  a citizen must not be colored. If colored persons<br>  were not citizens, Mr S.
  claimed that they were not inhabitants, which<br>  conclusion was manifestly absurd.
  Color had no connection with the question of<br>  citizenship be birth, though it
  had in respect to naturalization. In deference<br>  to southern views, the Militia
  laws of the nation, passed in 1792, did not<br>  include colored persons—the words
  were, “every free white male citizen”—was<br>  not this an express recognition that
  persons other than whites were citizens?<br>  If “citizens” meant a white person
  only, why was this language used? (Mr S.<br>  here read from Ingersoll’s digest
  745, relative to the protections granted to<br>  American seamen, which, he said
  were always given to blacks as well as<br>  whites.) The war of 1812 was caused,
  continued Mr S., in no small degree, by<br>  the impressment of our seamen who had
  these protections in their pockets. Our<br>  government considered the impressment
  of blacks who had these protections, as<br>  standing on the same ground with the
  impressment of the whites, and the war<br>  was declared and fought as much on their
  account as on account of the whites.<br>  The law in relation to American shipping
  required that in order to be entitled<br>  to discriminating duties at the custom
  house, it must be owned in whole or in<br>  part, by American Citizens. Colored
  persons frequently owned ships which were<br>  uniformly regarded as the property
  of American citizens.<br></p><p>Mr S. named Paul Cuffee as an instance.</p><p>  The
  courts of the United States were open to citizens and also to<br>  aliens—aliens,
  however, must describe themselves as such, on order to maintain<br>  an action.
  The uniform practice was for blacks to sue as citizens, never as<br>  aliens. Mr
  S. here read from Kent’s Com. and claimed from the doctrine there<br>  advanced
  that a black might go from one State to another, and enjoy in that<br>  other, the
  same privileges that a person of the same class enjoyed who<br>  belonged to that
  other State, I do not claim, said Mr S., that a citizen of an<br>  other State coming
  into this State, brings all privileges with him which he<br>  before enjoyed—he
  brings with him however the character of a citizen of the<br>  United States, and
  that entitles him to enjoy here, the same privileges with<br>  our citizens under
  circumstances similar to his own.<br></p><p>  Gen. Jackson, said Mr S., in his proclamation
  at New Orleans, addressed the<br>  blacks as “fellow citizens.” Did he mean to insult
  them? No, he meant to<br>  recognize them as citizens and the law so recognized
  them. They could purchase<br>  and hold real estate, could gain a settlement, and
  could, in fact, do what<br>  citizen[s] could, and what aliens could not do. It
  would be an insult to talk<br>  of naturalizing a man born here. The constitution
  of our State had been<br>  alluded to, in order to prove that blacks were not citizens,
  because it did<br>  not allow them to vote. Voting was not test of citizenship.
  If it was then by<br>  the showing of the gentleman, blacks were citizens, for in
  New York they were<br>  allowed to vote, and were therefore, according to the gentleman,
  citizens of<br>  the United States in New York; of course they were citizens here.<br></p><p>  Mr
  Strong here replied to the arguments which had been drawn from the course<br>  of
  legislation pursued by other States in respect to the blacks—the law of<br>  Ohio,
  &amp;c. He read the law of Louisiana, which affixed a penalty of $500 or<br>  the
  first offence of instruct[ing] a black in the Sabbath Schools, death for<br>  the
  second. The jury, he said, were not to regard the laws of other States as<br>  necessarily
  giving the true construction to the Constitution.—These laws, if<br>  unconstitutional,
  did not support our law, and it was their province to decide<br>  their constitutionality.
  He also referred to a late opinion of Judge Baldwin,<br>  given in the Circuit Court
  of the United States, and also to the opinion of<br>  Judge Washington before referred
  to, with respect to the rights of citizens of<br>  the U. States in the several
  states.<br></p><p>  Our ancient law, said Mr. S., which allowed persons to be carried
  out of the<br>  State, who were not citizens, was restrained from operating on apprentices,<br>  because
  they came for the acquisition of knowledge.—While minors were<br>  prevented from
  contracting for any thing but necessaries, they were allowed in<br>  express terms,
  to contract for the purpose of education.—Was education, he<br>  asked, a fundamental
  right? Ferdinand of Spain, he presumed did not believe<br>  that it was, neither
  did that king who was now chased through Portugal—and<br>  why? because education
  was the basis of liberty. Should such however be the<br>  doctrine of this free
  land? If our law had said that blacks in this state<br>  should not be educated
  at all, though inhuman and unchristian, it would not be<br>  liable to the same
  objections that it now is. The case seemed to him as plain<br>  as any he had ever
  submitted to a jury. The conclusion followed on the heel of<br>  the premises. If
  a school was opened to blacks who belonged to this state, it<br>  was certain it
  must be open to those who came from other states, under the<br>  same circumstances,
  for by the Constitution of the United States, they were<br>  entitled to a community
  of rights.<br></p><p>  As it regarded the license, which, under this law, might
  be obtained of the<br>  select men and civil authority, ‘twas nothing at all—it
  would not be given,<br>  but, if it would, we were not bound to ask it. As well
  might we be told that<br>  we should not eat without their permission. That would
  merely starve the<br>  body—this starved the mind—it kept on husks that which confer
  on man his<br>  immortality.<br></p><p>  It was claimed that we had other laws of
  a similar character. ‘Twas no<br>  matter—it made this law no better—doing wrong
  once was no apology for doing it<br>  again, much less did it create a right to
  do it. Make the law equal as to its<br>  application and he would find no fault.<br></p><p>  He
  took the case of Eliza Glasko—she was an inhabitant of the state, and Ann<br>  Eliza
  Hammond was not. What difference could the Legislature make in relation<br>  to
  these persons as to the right to attend what school they chose? As to the<br>  law
  requiring citizens of other states to give bonds before they could<br>  maintain
  an action in our Courts, it operated equally—citizens of our state,<br>  if they
  resided out, were subject to the law—it depended simply on residence.<br>  The law
  providing against the settlement of paupers would not sustain this<br>  law. That
  required bonds for the support of those likely to become chargeable.<br>  Bonds
  were not sought here, except the bonds which tie the mind, and fetter<br>  the man—not
  bonds of security, but bonds of vassalage. It cannot, said Mr S.<br>  be sustained.
  The people would not endure the alien law of ‘98—‘twas abhorrent<br>  to the principles
  of our government, and drove from power the man that made<br>  it. This law has
  features even more odious than that. The people will not and<br>  ought not to endure
  it. By sanctioning this law, he said the jury would<br>  sanction a principle which
  would prevent them or their sons from emigrating to<br>  the western states.<br></p><p>  He
  trusted he need spend no more time—he believed they would do their duty. He<br>  should
  ask the court to charge them that the law was obnoxious to the charges<br>  he has
  made against it, but should the court do otherwise, his appeal was to<br>  them.
  It was their prerogative to pass upon this law which owed its creation<br>  to an
  excited state of feeling. To them he looked for a verdict which would<br>  maintain
  civil liberty.<br></p><p>  Mr WELCH regretted the duty that had devolved upon him
  his state of health,*<br>  and his recent connexion with the case, would, he said,
  perhaps prevent him<br>  from doing to the case even that justice case which might
  have been in his<br>  power to do under other circumstances. Besides the eloquence
  and ingenuity of<br>  the defendant’s counsel might have diverted the mind of the
  jury from the real<br>  issue. He should discharge his duty without personal feeling.
  If he had before<br>  harbored any, he should strive to banish it from his mind
  now. He wished the<br>  right of the state of Connecticut to be fairly, impartially,
  and<br>  dispassionately examined. The government asked no conviction but upon<br>  principles
  which could be consistently reconciled with justice and the<br>  constitution. The
  fact that the defendant was a female had been alluded to,<br>  but this altered
  not her rights. She had the same and none other rights, than<br>  every citizen.
  Her hoped the jury would not be misled by the impassioned<br>  flashes of eloquence
  which they had heard from her counsel. He would have them<br>  pause and examine.
  The rights of the judge and the beggar were the same at the<br>  bar of justice.
  Rights there, were common, but artificial rights in society<br>  were different.
  The rights of citizens had been pressed upon their<br>  attention—the rights of
  states must not be forgotten.<br></p><p>  Was the law Constitutional? Possibly it
  was not. Laws has been passed which<br>  undoubtedly were unconstitutional, and
  if this was, he asked no conviction<br>  under it. They had but one course to pursue.
  If the law was contrary to the<br>  constitution they were bound to acquit—no one,
  if such was the character of<br>  the law, would acquiesce in the decision more
  cheerfully than himself. The<br>  gentlemen opposed to him has said, very emphatically,
  that they appealed to<br>  the people if the court decided the law to be constitutional.
  The jury, he<br>  said, were the people. It was no doubt true that in criminal cases
  the jury<br>  could decide the in spite of the court, but, was it enviable? Would
  they<br>  desire to do it? Rights were at stake, the rights of the state as well
  as the<br>  rights of the party.—He would have the jury look at the result of their<br>  verdict
  as it respected the effects it would have on these rights. They might<br>  take
  the law into their own hands and acquit the defendant. They sacrificed<br>  the
  rights of the state beyond remedy by doing so—their verdict against the<br>  state
  was final. If, however, they found a verdict against the defendant, it<br>  had
  no such effect on her. The case could be carried to another tribunal where<br>  she
  could have perfect justice, and where her rights would not be at all<br>  prejudiced
  by a conviction here. ‘Twas no hardship to her, and a contrary<br>  course might
  do an irremediable wrong to the state.<br></p><p>  They had been told that they
  had, that day, to decide a great question—an<br>  exciting one. It was true. Why
  then had they been called so loudly to take the<br>  case from the court? If they
  decided the law to be unconstitutional ‘twould be<br>  no evidence except between
  the same parties as a matter of fact. Another jury<br>  might decide the law to
  be constitutional, and this what was a crime at one<br>  time would be no crime
  at another, though tried under the same law. He had no<br>  idea that they had any
  motive but to discharge impartially their duties as<br>  jurors.<br></p><p>  Mr
  W. said, that as the defendant, by her plea, had put all the facts<br>  necessary
  to her conviction in issue, he should now examine the proof. The<br>  counsel for
  the defence had seemed tacitly to admit the facts charged to be<br>  true, but as
  he did not mean to desert any part of the case which the<br>  gentlemen opposed
  to him had not distinctly admitted to be in favor of the<br>  prosecution, he should
  recapitulate the evidence, and see if a case had been<br>  made out. (Mr W. here
  examined the testimony, commented upon it at length, and<br>  claimed that it was
  perfectly conclusive.)<br></p><p>  The gentlemen who had argued for the defence,
  said Mr W., never meant to make<br>  the constitutionality of this law a point in
  the case. They thought they had<br>  thrown a barrier around their client by closing
  the mouths of witnesses. It<br>  was the object of the gentlemen to go out of court
  in triumph for want of<br>  proof to convict, but the grating doors of a certain
  building, though it did<br>  not unstop deaf ears, did open dumb mouths. The witnesses
  then spoke,<br>  notwithstanding the gentlemen had hoped to apply to them the gag
  law. Their<br>  efforts had proved ineffectual—their flag was furled, and when he
  saw the<br>  quivering step of a retreating army he believed that they anticipated
  defeat.<br></p><p>  Mr W. rejoiced that a spirit was going abroad to improve the
  colored race.<br>  ‘Twas one thing however to produce a reformation by proper and
  legal means and<br>  another by improper and illegal ones. He would refrain no longer
  from<br>  considering the constitutional question in the case. The law was called<br>  unconstitutional
  because it was said to prohibit free persons of color from<br>  coming into this
  state, from other states, to be educated. Mr W. said that he<br>  knew no better
  way of testing constitutionality of a law, than a comparison of<br>  the law with
  the provisions of the constitution. Whenever they came in<br>  collision, it was
  easy to decide which must stand.—By this test then, by a<br>  comparison of the
  letter of the law with the letter of the constitution, he<br>  perceived no discrepancy.
  (Mr W. here read the second section of the fourth<br>  article of the constitution
  and then read the law.) Now, continued Mr W. this<br>  law does not prohibit any
  one from coming here for any purpose, if permission<br>  be obtained. If it is on
  the prohibition that gentlemen claim the law to be<br>  unconstitutional. But if
  permission be granted in all cases when asked, as<br>  possibly it may be, where
  is the unconstitutionality of the law? The gentlemen<br>  claim that it is prohibitory
  and therefore unconstitutional—it may never be<br>  prohibitory; how then is it
  unconstitutional? In order, gentlemen, said Mr W.,<br>  to determine that this law
  is unconstitutional, you must look through the<br>  vista of coming time, and with
  a keen prophetic vision, foresee that the civil<br>  authority will never grant
  their license. You must settle a question of face<br>  which you cannot settle.
  If you can find this fact, put it in your<br>  verdict—render this libel on your
  understandings along with it—such a<br>  principle as this ought not to be contended
  for—the tears of contrition should<br>  blot it out, and the blush of shame should
  light a fire to consume it.<br></p><p>  In respect to the meaning of the term “citizen”
  in the constitution, Mr. W.<br>  claimed that the ground taken by Mr. Judson, in
  opening the case, was<br>  tenable—that the term was used in a technical sense.
  He denied that it meant<br>  all persons who lived and moved within certain limits,
  as he understood the<br>  gentleman to claim. (Mr. W. here read from the articles
  of confederation, to<br>  support his construction of the term “citizen.”) He said
  that his brother<br>  Strong had read this quotation of a long trot, as though he
  feared the jury<br>  would understand it, and perceive the fallacy of his argument.
  Mr W. claimed<br>  that there was a distinction between the term “people” or “inhabitants,”
  in<br>  the article of confederation, and the term “citizens” in the constitution.
  He<br>  also read from Dr. Webster’s dictionary the definition of “citizen,” and<br>  insisted
  that blacks do not come within it.—Mr. W. also read and commented on<br>  the subject
  of naturalization, and claimed that Congress had never treated<br>  blacks as capable
  of becoming citizens. It was not the policy of the<br>  government. The Missouri
  question had been alluded to, but the whole of it was<br>  one continued act of
  political juggling—he should not think of appealing to it<br>  as authority for
  any thing.<br></p><p>  Mr. W. said that he derived a strong argument in construction
  which he gave<br>  the constitution from the usages and legislation of other states.
  He then went<br>  on to remark at length upon the statutes of many of the states,
  in relation to<br>  the black population. If blacks were citizens he said the legislatures
  of many<br>  of the states must be called worse than Turkish tyrants—He dwelt with
  much<br>  emphasis and ability on the laws of Massachusetts and Rhode Island,<br>  prohibiting
  the intermarriage of whites and blacks. These laws said Mr. W.,<br>  could only
  be reconciled with the constitution on the ground that blacks were<br>  not citizens.
  The right of education had been called a fundamental right. He<br>  was not disposed
  to contest the truth of this position. The right of selecting<br>  the partner of
  one’s joys and sorrows was however a right no less dear, no<br>  less sacred, than
  the right of selecting those whom we will have to educate<br>  our children. If
  our law was unconstitutional it was clear that all these laws<br>  to which he had
  alluded were also unconstitutional. He did not believe they<br>  were—the fact that
  they had been acquiesced I so long was evidence conclusive<br>  to his mind that
  they were not.<br></p><p>  The case had been so fully gone into by his associate
  who opened the case,<br>  that he would not detain the jury longer. He put the rights
  of the state into<br>  their hands, and also the rights of the defendant, under
  direction of the<br>  court as to the law. They were not to inquire whether their
  verdict would<br>  advance the power of one party of another—whether it would feed
  or allay the<br>  excitement which existed. They should forget all that did not
  legitimately<br>  belong to the case—even the eloquence of the gentleman wo had
  argued for the<br>  defence should be forgotten, so far as it was not relevant.
  Duties were<br>  theirs—consequences devolved elsewhere.<br></p><p>His Honor Judge
  EATON then charged the jury in substance as follows.</p><p><em>Gentlemen of the
  Jury:</em></p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Prudence<br>  Crandall is charged in the information before you, with a violation
  of a<br>  certain statute law of this state, forbidding the setting up of a school
  for<br>  the instruction of colored persons, not inhabitants of this state, or boarding<br>  or
  harboring them for the purpose of instruction. Provided the acts charged<br>  are
  proved to be done, the day is not material, if since the passage of the<br>  law,
  and before the filing of the information. Neither are the names nor the<br>  number
  of the persons instructed material. The facts must be proved to your<br>  satisfaction,
  gentlemen, and whether they are so or not you are the sole<br>  judges—it is not
  the duty of the court even to advise in relation to the<br>  measure of proof.<br></p><p>  As
  to the law of the case, this also belongs to you to decide, but the Court<br>  has
  a duty to perform with regard to it. That duty is, to advise you as to its<br>  validity
  and constitutionality. It has been claimed at the Bar that the law is<br>  unconstitutional,
  and that the state legislature had no power to pass it. It<br>  is gratifying to
  the court, gentlemen, that its opinion is not final—that it<br>  can be revised
  by a higher tribunal, and corrected if erroneous. The opinion<br>  of the Court
  is, that the law is constitutional and obligatory on the people<br>  of this state.—You
  will take the case into consideration, gentlemen, and<br>  render a verdict of guilty
  or not guilty, as to you shall seem just and<br>  proper.<br></p><p>  The jury retired,
  and after an absence of several hours, returned into Court<br>  not having agreed
  on a verdict. They were again ordered out, and again<br>  returned not having agreed.
  The third time they stated to the court that there<br>  was no probability that
  they should ever agree. The court then discharged<br>  them. This operates as a
  continuance of the case to the next term of the<br>  County Court to be holden on
  the second Tuesday of December<br>  next.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>  F.<br></p>
