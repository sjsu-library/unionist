transcription: "<em>Mahomedans.</em>â€”A traveller [sic] says, that during his long
  residence at Malta, and constantcourse of commercial transactions with the professors
  of the Mahomedan creed, henever heard of an unpaid debt, or a violated obligation:
  and that it is a usualmode of traffic in the market towns, throughout Turkey, for
  the farmers andhucksters to leave their fowls, eggs, butter, &amp;c. in baskets
  with the pricesfixed, and to return in&nbsp; the evening in perfect security of
  finding thearticle as they left it or the exact price deposited in the place of
  just somuch as had found a purchaser."
Scholarly Notes: 
Commentary: Many of the radical abolitionists were among those also arguing for religious
  tolerance. This article, in its candid assessment of Islam, and therefore its sideways
  critique of Christianity, is a sign of this gradual change underway (and this, despite
  the cringe-worthy "Mahomedan" moniker)
