transcription: If the provisions of this law can be reconciled with the nature of
  ourgovernment, or the principles of common justice, we greatly mistake itscharacter.
  We know not on what grounds the distinction which it makes can bejustified. Why
  should one portion of our community be deprived of privilegesenjoyed by others,
  merely on account of a difference of complexion? If there isany good reason for
  the restrictions embraced in the law, let them at leastextend to schools and seminaries
  of every description; let all fare alike, thewhite as well as the black. But let
  not the latter be visited with pains andpenalties while the former are exempt. As
  to the clamor which is raised aboutthe fanaticism of those who are friendly to the
  instruction of the blacks, orthe sneers and censures so liberally bestowed upon
  Miss Crandall, they cannot,even if well founded, alter the character of the law.
  The correctness of theirview, and the expediency of their measures, are different
  questions from thejustice of the law by which it is proposed to counteract them.
  The indiscretionof individuals, allowing them to exist, are no justification of
  a legalenactment unequal, oppressive and wrong in its provisions, and at war with
  thegenius of our republican institutions. In some of the papers from the slavestates,
  the law as was to be expected, is commended; it is seen to be inaccordance with
  the rigorous measures adopted under a system of slavery—but inother sections of
  our country, it is strongly condemned, and regarded as a shameand reproach to our
  state.” –<em>Connecticut Courant</em>
