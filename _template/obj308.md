  \ Senatorial District George Spafford has a majority of between three and four<br>
  \ hundred over Philip Pearl, Jr. the Jackson candidate. The 1<br>  <sup>st</sup>
  \ , 2d, 8<br>  <sup>th</sup>  , 14<br>  <sup>th</sup>  and 21<br>  <sup>st</sup>
  \ districts have elected anti-Jacksonian Senators. No returns have been received<br>
  \ from the other districts.<br></p><p>  From a letter received by a gentleman in
  this town we gather the following<br>  returns: Hartford, Monday Evening. Hartford,
  1<br>  <sup>st</sup>  Rep. W. Hungerford 965 to 833; 2d “______ Hanks 932 to 798
  both Anti Jackson<br>  men. In E. Hartford, E. Windsor, (majority 140) Enfield,
  Manchester,<br>  (reported) Wethersfield, Middletown, Durham, Winchester, Coventry,
  (reported)<br>  Avon, have gone Anti-Jackson. Southington doubtful. Glastonbury,
  Suffield and<br>  Mansfield are reported to have gone for Jackson candidates.<br></p><p>
  \ THE ELECTION.—The returns so far as received, give strong indications that<br>
  \ Jacksonism in this State is prostrated. Last year every town in the 13<br>  <sup>th</sup>
  \ District was represented by Jackson men, now only one Jackson man* goes from<br>
  \ this district. The 14<br>  <sup>th</sup>  District had two or three representatives
  who were either wholly Jackson men,<br>  or sometimes acted as such; now we believe
  not a man goes from that district<br>  who is not decidedly Anti-Jackson. Last year
  the Jackson party carried one of<br>  the Senators in this county. This year both
  Senators are Anti-Jackson, and<br>  elected by decisive majorities. Instead of a
  respectable majority<br>  <em>for</em>  Pearl, as was the case last year, the 13<br>
  \ <sup>th</sup>  District now gives more than 300 majority<br>  <em>against</em>
  \ him. The intelligence which we have received from other quarters is of much<br>
  \ the same character. Hartford, represented last year by Jackson men, has now<br>
  \ elected the Anti-Jackson candidates by nearly 150 majority. In several other<br>
  \ towns from which we have heard, similar changes have taken place. There is<br>
  \ scarce room for doubt that Governor Edwards will be elected—to quit the office<br>
  \ as soon as his present term expires, and that the whole Anti-Jackson State<br>
  \ ticket will succeed, if not already chosen by the people. We would not affect<br>
  \ an indifference which we do not feel at this result, for it is the<br>  accomplishment
  of the wish which we expressed in our prospectus, that the rule<br>  of the present
  dynasty might be brief; but though we rejoice, we feel no<br>  disposition to indulge
  in extravagant exultation at the defeat of Jacksonism.<br></p><p>  * With the exception
  of one, who, however, if we have been rightly informed,<br>  generally acted with
  that party in the Legislature.<br></p>"
