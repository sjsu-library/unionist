transcription: <p>  We have pleasure in noticing the following incident in the proceedings
  of the<br>  Legislature of Pennsylvania, which certainly goes far to show that the<br>  politics
  of that important State are sound at bottom:<br></p><p align="center">  HARRISBURGH
  MONDAY, FEB. 24<br>  <sup>th</sup></p><p>  On Saturday last, both Houses met at
  9 oâ€™clock, &amp; the Farewell Address of<br>  WASHINGTON was read, after which they
  immediately adjourned. To-day, in the<br>  House, 1000 copies of the Address were
  ordered to be printed for distribution.<br></p>
Scholarly Notes: 
Commentary: 'The legislature of Pennsylvania apparently made the publication of Washington''s
  Farewell Address an annual event. While I was unable to procure the 1834 edition,
  I have included the title page from 1837, that indicates the same date (Washington''s
  birthday, February 22) and the resolve of the elected officials to publish it. Just
  as the publication of Dymond meant that the students at the Canterbury Female Academy
  were gaining access to high-level current philosophy, the emphasis on the speeches
  of Clay and Washington indicate that, like any students in an advanced academy of
  that time, they were exposed to high-level examples of public speaking and political
  rhetoric. '
