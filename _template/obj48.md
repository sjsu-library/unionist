transcription: "<em>Connecticut</em>BLACK<em>Laws.</em>—We mentioned, a short time
  since, that the Legislature of Connecticut hadpassed a law forbidding under heavy
  penalties, every individual in that statefrom teaching colored people from other
  States to<em>read and write!</em>We took no farther notice of it at the time, supposing
  it to be intended as asort of quiz upon the Yankees, or perhaps a paragraph thrown
  in by somemischievous printer’s<em>imp,</em>to fill out a newspaper column. But
  now seems there was ‘no mistake’ in thematter. A young lady by the name of Crandall,
  of Canterbury, in that state, isnow suffering the penalty of that law in<em>a prison!</em>Yes,
  the State of Connecticut, with all its boasted philanthropy andchristianity—a State
  which annually sends tens of thousands of dollars toinstruct the heathen on the
  opposite side of the globe, in the arts, sciencesand DOGMAS of civilization, will
  not allow the<em>free citizens</em>of our own country to be taught to<em>read and
  write</em>&nbsp;within the limits of their state! How long is it, we would ask,
  since theentire population of the “universal Yankee nation,’ appeared ready to take
  uparms, break open the prison doors of the Georgia penitentiary, release themissionaries,
  Worcester and Butler, and nullify the law for a willful violationof which they had
  been imprisoned: a law, by the way, far less anti-republicanand unconstitutional
  than this Connecticut law, under which a worthy female hasbeen imprisoned. Admirable
  consistency! Pure Christianity! More on this subject,anon.—<em>Liverpool (Pa.) Mercury.</em>"
