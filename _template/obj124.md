transcription: "<em>Kidnapping.</em>—A man of color, named John Hill, was brought
  before the police magistrate onMonday, charged with abduction, in taking away Sarah
  Jane Demons, a girl ofcolor, aged six years, from the house of Emilia Smith, a woman
  of color, whoresides at 99 Greenwich st. On Sunday evening three gentlemen observed
  theprisoner carrying a child, which was crying, and seemed very reluctant to betaken
  away. The gentlemen stopped Hill, and questioned him as to how he came inpossession
  of the child. He gave them evasive answers, and they then inquired ofthe child where
  she lived. The little girl told them her place of residence, andsignified her entire
  ignorance of the cause for which Hill had taken her away.The gentlemen considered
  the case sufficiently suspicious to warrant them inarresting the prisoner, and one
  of them, assisted by a man of color, namedBristol Martin, lodged him in prison,
  whilst the other restored the little girlto her friends. Hill’s explanation of the
  affair was, that he merely took thechild to<em>give it some candy</em>. He had been
  seen the same evening endeavoring to take away another child, who,however, struggled
  so hard as to make him abandon his design. The occurrencecreated considerable excitement
  amongst the people of color in the city, a largenumber of whom attended to hear
  the case disposed of. Hill was committed toprison.—<em>Jour. Com.</em>"
Scholarly Notes: A NYC kidnapping could well have been of interest to numerous students
  at the Canterbury Female Academy
Commentary: These two articles on kidnapping are likely from The NY<br><em>Journal
  of Commerce</em>, another innovation by Arthur Tappan, in partnership with Samuel
  Morse.<br>
