transcription: RANKIN’S LETTERS. Just published at the office of the Liberator, by
  request ofthe Providence Anti-Slavery Society, a new edition of ‘Letters on Slavery,addressed
  to Mr. Thomas Rankin, Merchant at Middlebrook, Augusta Co., Va.—ByJohn Rankin, Pastor
  of the Presbyterian Churches of Ripley and Strait Creek,Brown County, Ohio. Price
  $18 per hundred—25 cents single. Boston, Sept. 7,1833.
Scholarly Notes: 
Commentary: Another important text that almost certainly found its way inside the
  Canterbury Female Academy. Rankin became one of the most fearless and successful
  conductors of self-liberated people fleeing enslavement, due to his location in
  Ohio just over the border from Kentucky. Rankin's <em>Letters</em> were admired
  by William Lloyd Garrison, and read by many Abollitionists in thie 1830s.
