transcription: "<p>A CARD.</p><p>  In directing the attention of their readers to
  the improvements and exertions<br>  that have been increasingly made, to elevate
  the Ladyâ€™s Book to that station<br>  which it now occupies, the Proprietors have
  incurred a very considerable<br>  expence [sic], which deserves on the subscribers,
  a suitable punctuality in<br>  meeting<br>  <em>their</em>  engagements. To them,
  individually, the amount of the subscription is a<br>  trifle, but to the proprietors,
  it is, collectively, of the utmost importance;<br>  and it is confidently expected
  that the early transmission of arrears, will<br>  prove to them that their intentions
  and exertions have not been disregarded or<br>  forgotten, by those for whom they
  have been made.<br></p><p>  After the first of January it is the intention of the
  proprietors to send<br>  circulars to all who are arrears one year. Subscribers
  wishing to avoid the<br>  expense of postage, will please make payment before that
  time.<br></p>"
