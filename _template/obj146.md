transcription: As the Unionist has requested, we have reperused our remarks upon the
  conductand designs of the abolitionists, and we find little to modify and nothing
  toretract. To the charge of severity and injustice towards the characters of theleaders
  in this crusade, we reply—<em>Physician heal thyselfˆ–</em>clear your own eyes of
  motes and films before you proceed to pull out beams fromthe eyes of others. The
  whole vocabulary of abuse and contumely has beenexhausted by the abolitionists in
  their attempts to defame the motives andblacken the characters of the members of
  the Colonization society—so that now wescarcely see aught else in the columns of
  the Liberator and Emancipator, butnumerous repetitions of the same false and unfounded
  charges. Indeed, one wouldthink, from the matter contained in those papers, that
  their<em>sole</em>object is to destroy the Colonization society; as if that being
  accomplished,every thing else was easy. Now let the merits of abolitionism be ten
  times whatits warmest abettors assert, no reasonable objection can be made to theColonization
  Society whatever. It proposes to transport free blacks to Africawith their own consent,
  and if the blacks are willing to go, pray may not<em>free white</em>men give their
  money for the purpose without asking the consent of the Presidentof the Anti-Slavery
  Society? Where was the kindness and charity of Garrison, yeamore, where was his
  regard for moral probity, when he said that his object ingoing to England was to
  raise funds for the establishment of a manual laborschool—and now, since his return,
  he acknowledges that he was induced to thevoyage by a desire to represent (misrepresent
  he should have said) the objectand designs of the Colonization Society to the English.
  That he slandered hiscountrymen in London, there is abundant proof. Since he returned,
  he deniesit—so that no less than four falsehoods lie at his door, without the possibilityof
  any good accruing from either. How much was there “of the law of kindness aswell
  as of the requisitions of justice” in the latter which the patron of theUnionist
  wrote to some students, and which he requested might be published; whenhe said that
  he looked upon the Colonization Society<em>in no other light than an emissary of
  Satan</em>—whose only object is to perpetuate slavery? And who have been more frequentlyaccused
  of falsehood and misrepresentation than Rev. Mr. Gurley and Mr. Finley?We do not
  ask these questions to justify ourselves if we have done wrong, butmerely to, let
  our “brother” see that it ill becomes him to throw stones. Tillhe &amp; his sect
  are free from sin they should be slow in condemning others. Asto what we asserted
  concerning the leaders in the abolition enterprize, we deemit strictly true. When
  they are told that the constitution forbids the freestates from meddling with property
  at the south, they reply in the language ofthe Apostle to the Jewish Ruler—we must
  obey God and not man—thus assertingtheir independence of the laws under which we
  live. If they respect the laws,why does not Miss Crandall dismiss her school? Till
  the decision of Judge Daggetis over ruled, that decision is the law of the land,
  which every honest citizenis bound to respect—and yet we see the Genius of Temperance,
  (the Editors ofwhich call themselves Christians par excellence) encouraging her
  to continue inopposition to a decree of one of the highest tribunals in the state.
  We find theabolitionists endeavoring to cast contempt upon the Colonization Society,because
  the latter speak of what is expedient to be done, in opposition to thedesigns of
  the&nbsp; former—and meeting in the&nbsp; writings of a gentleman oftalents and
  learning, a quotation about&nbsp; expediency being “a wrap-rascal,”they have rung
  the charges upon it, till it has fairly become stale, notforgetting in the excess
  of their charity to insinuate that whoever may doubt ofthe expediency of a measure,
  there can be no question as to the character whichsuch person&nbsp; should sustain
  in their own immaculate conceptions. Did theseover scrupulous gentlemen every hear
  or read of one who said that “all thingsare lawful for me, but all things are not
  expedient.” In the present state ofthe country immediate and unconditional abolition
  is neither<em>expedient</em>nor<em>lawful</em>—and those engaged in promoting it
  are only planting the seeds of sedition. Letthem beware that in sowing the wind,
  the do not reap the whirlwind.
