transcription: THE SENSES FALLIBLE WITNESSES.â€”When we bathe in the sea, or in a cold
  bath, weare accustomed to consider the water as colder than the air, and the air
  colderthan the clothes which surround us. Now all these objects are, in fact, the
  sametemperature. A thermometer surrounded by the cloth of our coast or suspended
  inthe atmosphere, or immersed in the sea, will stand at the same temperature. Alinen
  shirt, when first put on, will feel colder than a cotton one, and aflannel shirt
  will actually feel warm; yet all these have the same temperature.The sheets of the
  bed feel cold, and the blankets warm; the blankets and sheets,however, are equally
  warm. A still, calm atmosphere in summer, feels warm, butif a wind arises the same
  atmosphere feels cool. Now, a thermometer suspendedunder shelter, and in a calm
  place, will indicate exactly the same temperatureas a thermometer on which the wind
  blows.
