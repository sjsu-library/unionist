  align="center">[From a pamphlet recently published in England.}</p><p>  Of the many
  persons who declare themselves averse to slavery and yet afraid to  join in measures
  or its abolition, some perhaps have not paid much attention  to the instances of
  emancipation that have already taken place. If any such  will take the trouble to
  read the following account of the effects of  emancipation as far as it has hitherto
  been tried, they will perhaps see that  their fears on the subject are not justified
  by experience.</p><p>  The History of Hayti when separated from the accidental circumstances  attending
  it, furnishes irrefragable evidence of the safety and advantage of  immediate emancipation.
  It is true that much blood was shed there during the  French revolution; but this
  was not owing to the emancipation of the slaves,  but was the consequence either
  of the civil war which preceded the act of  emancipation; or of the atrocious attempt
  to restore slavery.</p><p>  In September, 1793, Polvirel, one of the Commissioners
  sent to St. Domingo by  the National Convention, issues a proclamation declaring
  the whole of the  slaves in the island free. Colonel Malenfant, a slave proprietor,
  resident at  the time in the island, thus describes the effects of this sudden measure.  “After
  this public act of emancipation, the Negroes remained quiet both in the  south and
  in the west, and they continued to work upon all the plantations.  There were estates
  which had neither owners nor managers resident upon them,  and on those estates
  where no white men were left to direct them, they betook  themselves to the planting
  of provisions; but upon all plantations where the  whites resided, the blacks continued
  to labor as quietly as before.” Colonel  Malenfant says, that when many of his neighbors,
  proprietors or managers, were  in prison, the negroes of their plantations came
  to him to beg him to direct  them in their work. “If you will take care not to talk
  to them of the  restoration of slavery, but talk to them of freedom, you may with
  this word  chain them down to their labor. How did Toussaint succeed?—How did I
  succeed  before is time in the plain of the Culde-Sac on the plantation Gourand,
  during  more than eight months after liberty had been granted to the slaves? Let
  those  who knew me at that time, let the blacks themselves, be asked: they will
  all  reply that not a single negro upon that plantation, consisting of more than  four
  hundred and fifty laborers, refused to work: and yet this plantation was  thought
  to be under the worst discipline and the slaves the most idle of any  in the plain.
  I inspired the same activity into three other plantations of  which I had the management.
  I all the negroes had come from Africa within six  months, if they had the love
  of independence that the Indians have, I should  own that force must be employed;
  but ninety-nine out of a hundred of the  blacks are aware that without labor they
  cannot procure the things that are  necessary for them; that there is no other method
  of satisfying their wants  and their tastes. They know that they must work; the
  wish to do so, and they  will do so.”</p><p>  Such was the conduct of the negroes
  for the first nine months after their  liberation, or up to the middle of 1794.
  In the latter part of 1796, Malenfant  says, “The colony was flourishing under Toussaint,
  the whites lived happily  and in peace upon their estates, and the negroes continued
  to work for them”  General Lecroix who published his “Memoirs for a history of St.
  Domingo” in  1819, says that in 1797 the most wonderful progress had been made in  agriculture.
  “The Colony,” said he, “marched as by enchantment towards its  ancient splendor:
  cultivation prospered; every day produced perceptible proof  of its progress.” General
  Vincent, who was a general of brigade of artillery  in St. Domingo and a proprietor
  of estates in the island, was sent by  Toussaint to Paris in 1801 to lay before
  the Directory the new constitution  which had been agreed upon in St. Domingo. He
  arrived in France just at the  moment of the peace of Amiens, and found that Bonaparte
  was preparing an  armament for the purpose of restoring slavery in St. Domingo.
  He remonstrated  against the expedition; he stated that it was totally unnecessary
  and  therefore criminal, for that every thing was going on well in St. Domingo.
  The  proprietors were in peaceable possessions of their estates; cultivation was  making
  rapid progress; the blacks were industrious and beyond example happy.  He conjured
  him, therefore not to reverse this beautiful state of things, but  his efforts were
  ineffectual, and the expedition arrived upon the shores of  St. Domingo. At length,
  however, the French were driven from the island. Till  that time the planters had
  retained their property, and then it was, and not  till then, that they lost their
  all. In 1804 Dessalines was proclaimed  Emperor; in process of time a great part
  of the black troops were disbanded,  and returned to cultivation again. From that
  time to this, there has been no  want o subordination or industry among them.</p><p>  The
  following account of the character and condition of the negroes of Hayti,  at a
  later period, is taken from “Sketches of Hayti” by Mr. Harvey, who during  the latter
  part of the reign of Christophe spent a considerable time at Cape  François the
  capital of his dominions. “The cultivators who formed the great  mass of the population,
  resided on or near the plantations of which they were  appointed to labor. A great
  proportion of them were engaged in cultivating the  estates of the king; if soldiers,
  they were fed and clothed at his expense; if  regular cultivators, they received
  such a share of the produce as was fully  adequate to yield them a competent maintenance.
  Others were in the employ of  the nobles and officers, who received either stated
  wages or such a portion of  the article they cultivated as was deemed a sufficient
  reward for their  industry, were equally supplied with whatever could contribute
  to their  comfort. And those who by their exertions and economy were enabled to
  procure  small spots of land of their own or to hold the smaller plantations at
  an  annual rent, were diligently engaged in cultivating coffee, sugar, and other  articles,
  which they disposed of to the inhabitants of the adjacent towns and  villages. It
  was an interesting sight to behold this class o the Haytians, now  in possession
  of their freedom, coming in groups to the market nearest which  they resided, bringing
  the produce of their industry for sale; and afterwards  returning, carrying back
  the necessary articles of living which the disposal  of their commodities had enabled
  them to purchase; all evidently cheerful and  happy. Nor could it fail to occur
  to the mind that their present condition  furnished the most satisfactory answer
  to that objection to the general  emancipation of slaves, founded on their alleged
  unfitness to value and  improve the benefits of liberty.</p><p>  Though of the same
  race and possessing the same general traits of character as  the negroes of the
  other West India islands, they are already distinguished  from them by habits of
  industry and activity such as slaves are seldom known  to exhibit. As they would
  not suffer, so they do not require the attendance of  one acting in the capacity
  of a driver with the instrument of punishment in  his hand.—As far as I had an opportunity
  of ascertaining from what fell under  my own observation, and from what I gathered
  from other European residents, I  am persuaded of one general fact which on account
  of its importance I shall  state in the most explicit terms, viz: that the Haytians
  employed in  cultivating the plantations, as well as the rest of the population,
  perform as  much work in a given time as they were accustomed to do during their  subjection
  to the French. And if we may judge of their future improvement by  the change which
  has already effected, it may be reasonably anticipated that  Hayti will ere long
  contain a population not inferior in their industry to  that of any civilized nation
  in the world.</p><p>  While the interior of this island was in this improving state,
  and its  inhabitants were peaceful and industrious, Cape Francois and other towns  presented
  scenes of the utmost order and activity: the great majority of the  inhabitants
  of Cape Francois consisted of trades-people and mechanics, the  former of whom were
  supplied by the resident merchants with cloths, linens,  silks and other manufactures,
  which they sold to the natives in small  quantities. Their business was seldom so
  great as to enable them to amass  fortunes, but it afforded them ample means of
  support. Towards strangers who  entered their shops, whether for the purpose of
  making purchases or not, they  were invariably and remarkably civil; a trait in
  the character of Christophe’s  subjects which I believe to have been universal.
  The mechanics, though many of  them were deficient in skill from having been imperfectly
  instructed, were all  enabled by their industry to gain a competent maintenance.
  On the whole, the  scene which Cape Francois presented was as interesting as it
  was in many  respects surprising. In few places of commerce could there be seen
  greater  regularity in the despatch [sic] of business, greater diligence displayed
  by  those engaged in it, or more evident marks of a prosperous state of things.  Every
  man had some calling to occupy his attention; instances of idleness or  intemperance
  were of rare occurrence, the most perfect subordination  prevailed, and all appeared
  contented and happy. A foreigner would have found  it difficult to persuade himself
  on his first entering the place, that the  people he now beheld so submissive, industrious
  and contented, were the same  people who a few years before has escaped from the
  shackles of slavery.”</p><p>  A gentleman who had been for upwards of twenty years
  past a general merchant  in Hayti, frequently crossing to Europe and America, gave
  the following  account of the condition of the Haytians to Capt. Stuart at Belfast
  last  winter. The present population he supposes consists of at least seven hundred  thousand.
  He said that there was very universal happiness amongst them,—and  that though their
  conduct was not unexceptionable, yet there was a less  distress, than in any other
  country of his knowledge. That they obtained  abundance by their own labor.—There
  were no paupers except the decrepid [sic]  and aged: that the people were very charitable,
  hospitable and kind, very  respectful to Europeans, temperate, grateul, faithful,
  orderly and submissive,  easily governable, lively and contented, good mechanics,
  and that no corporal  punishments are allowed.</p>'
Scholarly Notes: Ye gads this article is objectionable. It is all about how much the
  Haitians fit European and capitalist models. Subordination and submission, and the
  unquestioned superiority of European thought, systems and people is grating.
