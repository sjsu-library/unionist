scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: This epigram has deep New Testament and Socratic roots. It had also been
  recently restated by Samuel Johnson in a 1750 entry in ["The Rambler"] (https://www.johnsonessays.com/the-rambler/suspicious-justly-suspected/)
  . For the growing Peace and Non-Resistant movement, this epigram would become a
  life-guiding maxim.
