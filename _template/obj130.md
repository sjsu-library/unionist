transcription: "<p>  It is stated by a gentleman in Ohio, who had every opportunity
  and anxiety to  be correctly informed on the subject, that the emigrants into that
  State  during the last year were possessed of money to the amount of between six
  and  eight millions of dollars. A few years more of such emigration and Ohio will
  \ be one of the most wealthy and prosperous States of the Union.—  <em>S.C. Gaz.</em></p><p></p>"
Scholarly Notes: Interesting that this comes from South Carolina
Commentary: Many folks from eastern Connecticut – including famously the Cleveland
  family — were among the Ohio migrants
