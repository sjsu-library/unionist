transcription: "<p>  DIED.—At Voluntown, suddenly, Mr Reuben Fenner, aged about 60
  years. The<br>  circumstances attending his departure were lamentably horrid. On
  the evening<br>  of Sunday the 23d ult. being at the Tavern in company with one
  of his comrades<br>  the latter purchased a quart of<br>  <em>Cider Brandy</em>
  \ and they proceeded homeward together, occasionally sipping a little of the<br>
  \ <em>“good creatures”</em>  to drown their cares and exhilarate their drooping
  spirits. Arrived within<br>  sixty rods of the House to which they were going regaled
  themselves from the<br>  bottle till its contents were exhausted &amp; their cares
  being sufficiently<br>  drowned, the subject of this notice was there left by his
  friend to take care<br>  of himself, where on the following morning he was found
  dead<br>  <em>“lying partly on his face,”</em>  having died without a struggle,
  and presenting a striking example of the<br>  careless and easy man(ner) in which
  the votaries of intemperance are<br>  translated from one world to another!! A jury
  of inquest, after due<br>  examination and enquiry, pronounced the following verdict
  that,<br>  <em>    “The deceased came to his death by an intemperate use of ardent
  spirits.”<br>  </em>  This catastrophe and others of a like kind, which seem to
  be multiplying<br>  around us, manifest in a strong light the righteous indignation
  of Heaven at<br>  the vices of this age, and present to the maker, the vender and
  the drinker of<br>  distilled spirits, a subject for solemn and serious reflection.
  Let the<br>  distiller remember that he is opening a fountain, the streams from
  which will<br>  render barren the most fruitful field, and sweep away much that
  is valuable<br>  and lovely from the earth. Let the vender reflect that, for a paltry<br>
  \ consideration, he is sporting with the lives and future well being of his<br>
  \ fellow men, and is calling down upon his own head the unmitigated wrath of<br>
  \ Jehovah for thus “<br>  <em>hollding</em>  [sic]<br>  <em>the cup to his neighbor’s
  mouth.</em>  ” And let the drinker of distilled spirits, if yet the power of resistance
  is<br>  not broken down, beware of the suicidal cup: let him flee to the ark of<br>
  \ <em>total abstinence</em>  where there alone is safety, ere he is fast bound by
  the chains which the<br>  subtle enemy of his peace has forged for him, let him
  escape as for his life,<br>  let him made good his retreat while he can and resolve
  in the majesty of his<br>  strength, the grace of God enabling him, to act in accordance
  with that<br>  resolution, that he will<br>  <em>“touch not, taste not, handle not
  the unclean thing.”</em>  Whosoever will be free, let him be free indeed.<br></p><p></p>"
