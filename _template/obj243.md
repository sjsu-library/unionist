transcription: "<p>  DIED.—At Voluntown, suddenly, Mr Reuben Fenner, aged about 60
  years. The  circumstances attending his departure were lamentably horrid. On the
  evening  of Sunday the 23d ult. being at the Tavern in company with one of his comrades
  \ the latter purchased a quart of  <em>Cider Brandy</em>  and they proceeded homeward
  together, occasionally sipping a little of the  <em>“good creatures”</em>  to drown
  their cares and exhilarate their drooping spirits. Arrived within  sixty rods of
  the House to which they were going regaled themselves from the  bottle till its
  contents were exhausted &amp; their cares being sufficiently  drowned, the subject
  of this notice was there left by his friend to take care  of himself, where on the
  following morning he was found dead  <em>“lying partly on his face,”</em>  having
  died without a struggle, and presenting a striking example of the  careless and
  easy man(ner) in which the votaries of intemperance are  translated from one world
  to another!! A jury of inquest, after due  examination and enquiry, pronounced the
  following verdict that,  <em>    “The deceased came to his death by an intemperate
  use of ardent spirits.”  </em>  This catastrophe and others of a like kind, which
  seem to be multiplying  around us, manifest in a strong light the righteous indignation
  of Heaven at  the vices of this age, and present to the maker, the vender and the
  drinker of  distilled spirits, a subject for solemn and serious reflection. Let
  the  distiller remember that he is opening a fountain, the streams from which will
  \ render barren the most fruitful field, and sweep away much that is valuable  and
  lovely from the earth. Let the vender reflect that, for a paltry  consideration,
  he is sporting with the lives and future well being of his  fellow men, and is calling
  down upon his own head the unmitigated wrath of  Jehovah for thus “  <em>hollding</em>
  \ [sic]  <em>the cup to his neighbor’s mouth.</em>  ” And let the drinker of distilled
  spirits, if yet the power of resistance is  not broken down, beware of the suicidal
  cup: let him flee to the ark of  <em>total abstinence</em>  where there alone is
  safety, ere he is fast bound by the chains which the  subtle enemy of his peace
  has forged for him, let him escape as for his life,  let him made good his retreat
  while he can and resolve in the majesty of his  strength, the grace of God enabling
  him, to act in accordance with that  resolution, that he will  <em>“touch not, taste
  not, handle not the unclean thing.”</em>  Whosoever will be free, let him be free
  indeed.</p><p></p>"
