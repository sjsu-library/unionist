transcription: "<em>Another suspected case of Kidnapping.</em>—Two or three attempts
  to kidnap, here and at Philadelphia, have been recentlyrecorded, and we fear we
  have now to add another. Mary, a colored woman aged 21,a native of Africa, and for
  the last 9 months a resident in the family of IsaacL. Fuller, [colored], attended
  the methodist church in Church street last Sundayevening as usual, since which she
  has not been heard of. As she never beforekept irregular hours, and two or three
  days have elapsed without throwing anylight upon the cause of her sudden disappearance,
  Mr. Fuller is stronglyapprehensive that she has been kidnapped. She speaks very
  little English, havingbeen landed on our shores by a vessel from a foreign port
  less than a year ago.There is a remarkable streak extending down the centre of her
  forehead, nose andchin. Any information which can be given concerning her will be
  thankfullyreceived by Mr. Fuller, No. 33. Thomas st.—<em>Jour. of Com.</em>"
Scholarly Notes: How and why did Mary come to these shores? Was she ever found? Why
  did Burleigh include this news?
Commentary: These two articles on kidnapping are likely from The NY<br><em>Journal
  of Commerce</em>, another innovation by Arthur Tappan, in partnership with Samuel
  Morse.<br>
