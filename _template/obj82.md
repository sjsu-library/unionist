transcription: There is at present, in perfect operation, at the penitentiary, near
  Trenton,<br>(N.J.) a machine for the purpose of punching holes in bars of iron.
  Seven holes<br>can be perforated in one minute and a quarter through bars bars half
  an inch<br>thick, each hole being one and a quarter inches diameter, and the bar
  perfectly<br>cold.&nbsp; This is a very great labor and time saving invention, and
  is worthy<br>the attention of those engaged in that branch of mechanics.<br>
