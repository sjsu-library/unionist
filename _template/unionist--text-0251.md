transcription: "<em>Massachusetts.</em>â€”The delegation in Congress from that State
  is now full. The 8<br><sup>th</sup>trial to elect a member from the 9<br><sup>th</sup>District
  on Monday the 3d inst. resulted in the choice of Wm. Jackson, the<br>Antimasonic
  candidate, by a majority of between 90 and 100 over Dearborn and<br>Thurber, the
  candidates of the National Republican and Jackson parties. Mr.<br>Jackson is a sound,
  sensible, upright man, and endowed with those qualities of<br>head and heart which
  fit him to discharge the duties of his office honorably to<br>himself and beneficially
  to the country. He is decidedly opposed to the present<br>administration, and will
  stand shoulder to shoulder with Adams and Ellsworth and<br>the other good men and
  true of the New-England delegation, in contending for the<br>best interests of the
  country.<br>"

  Congress. He later was active in the Liberty and Free Soil parties, and came to

  Washington D.C.
