  on an eminence a little out of the  village, and arranged to accommodate a large
  number of students.</p><p>  Board, including washing and ordinary mending, can be
  obtained in respectable  families, at $1,50 per week.</p><p>Rates of Entrance and
  Tuition as follows, viz:â€”</p><p>Entrance 1,00.</p><p>  Reading, Writing, Elements
