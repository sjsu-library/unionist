transcription: The cause of Temperance prospers well in Massachusetts. Our good friends
  thereare doing nobly—they have their heart in the work. MR. FROST, the Apostle ofTemperance,
  and an eloquent and able man, has been lecturing in Norfolk County,and his labors
  have been attended with the most gratifying success. Those of ourfriends who have
  had the pleasure of hearing Mr. F. will not be surprised atthis. He possesses to
  an eminent degree the power of awakening and enchainingthe attention. His oratory
  is peculiar to himself—at least we never heard of itsmodel or successful imitation—always
  elevated and always fascinating. His voiceis musical—his gesticulation forcible,
  and, more than all, his acquaintance withhis subject in all its bearing is perfect,
  and his facility in rightly arrangingand applying sarcasm and argument, ridicule
  and persuasion, truly wonderful. ByMr. Frost’s report it appears that when he commenced
  his agency in the County,there were twenty-eight Temperance Societies, embracing
  6,511 members, to whichhave been added 2,375 others, and fourteen new societies
  have been organized,embracing 761 members. This tells well for Temperance effort
  in Massachusetts.Let our Connecticut friends do likewise.
Scholarly Notes: I have not yet determined if the hyper-active Temperance Advocate
  Daniel Frost is the same as the Daniel Frost, Jr., of Canterbury (1787-1863), who
  was among the opponents of the Canterbury Female Academy
