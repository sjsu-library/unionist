  UNIONIST.</strong></p><p>At no time more than at the present, has been felt the
  want, in this county, of a firm, independent press. The acts of our last legislature
  are a sufficient index of the character of that party which has obtained, for a
  brief space we hope, the ascendancy in this State. We cannot, for a moment, believe
  that a majority of the people of Connecticut, approve <em>all</em> the recent enactments
  of our Legislature, but such has been and is still the course pursued by the only
  press existing in this county, that many of the people are probably unapprised of
  the spirit and tendency of their proceedings. It is too evident to be denied, that
  the Advertiser is so devoted to the policy of a party, and the aggrandizement of
  a few party leaders, that a fair discussion of the pretensions and measures of our
  prominent men, cannot find admission to its columns. Hence the necessity of another
  organ of communication to the public, on the great interests of the state and nation,
  which has brought the Unionist before the public.</p><p>This paper will be pledged
  to no party, but will canvass the claims of all aspirants to the public favor, and
  all measures of public policy, on their own merits. On all the great questions upon
  which the mind of the community is divided, a free admission will be given to well
  and candidly written articles on both sides, if offered, but every thing of a scurrilous
  or abusive character will be excluded, come from what source it may.</p><p>The Unionist
  will be the advocate of temperance, virtue and sound morality, and will pursue that
  course which a deep conviction of the truth of the sentiment contained in its motto
  points out. It will also contain items of general intelligence, literary selections
  and the usual variety of miscellaneous matter, and no effort will be spared on the
  part of the editor to make it worthy of the public favor. How far his efforts will
  succeed, the future course of the paper will determine.</p><p>â˜›All who receive this
  number of the Unionist, and approve its plan, or are willing to patronize a work
  of this character, are requested to send us their names as subscribers, taking care
  to specify particularly, the place to which they wish their papers sent.</p><p></p>
