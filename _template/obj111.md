transcription: MAJOR JACK DOWNING.—This celebrated letter writer is about opening
  a school in<br>Downingville, for instruction in all branches of English education,
  including<br>speech-making and gymnastics. In a recent letter he expresses himself
  more<br>certain of being next President, than he is whether the letter<br><em>G</em>in
  gymnastics, should be sounded soft as in “Gineral,” or hard, as in “grog.”<br>

Commentary: 'Seba Smith (1792-1868) was a newspaper editor and humorist from Maine,
  where he created the character Major Jack Downing, a staple of newspapers in the
  antebellum period. He was also a pro-feminist man, the husband of Elizabeth Oakes
  Smith (1806-1893), a feminist writer, poet and activist. Their children adopted
  both of their parents'' names as their last name - Oaksmtih. Her most famous quote
  is "My friends, do we realize for what purpose we are convened? Do we fully understand
  that we aim at nothing less than an entire subversion of the present order of society,
  a dissolution of the whole existing social compact?" This was asked at the 1852
  National Woman''s Rights Conference. This website provides a full list of Elizabeth
  Oakes Smith''s writings and fills in more context - http://www.oakes-smith.org/ '
