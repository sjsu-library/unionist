transcription: COMMERCE OF CHINA. For more than a century past, almost the whole of
  Europeantrade has been restricted to Canton and Macao. But it was not always so.
  Atdifferent times during the reign of the Ming dynasty, the ports of Ningpo andChusan
  in Chekeang, and the port of Amoy in Fuhkeen, were opened to Europeans,and became
  large marts for their commerce. Kanghe in the twenty third year ofhis reign opened
  all the ports of his empire, and allowed a<em>free trade</em>to his own subjects
  and to all foreign nations. This regulation continued inforce for about thirty years.
  But at length it was argued against thisregulation, that foreigners and adventurous
  Chinese who were living abroad wouldimproverish the country by exporting large quantities
  of rice! For this, or someother reasons equally cogent, foreign trade was restricted;
  the emigration ofnatives and the ingress of foreigners, were prohibited; and, if
  we mistake not,the building of vessels on the European model was likewise interdicted.
