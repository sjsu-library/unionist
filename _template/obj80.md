transcription: COMMERCE OF CHINA. For more than a century past, almost the whole of
  European<br>trade has been restricted to Canton and Macao. But it was not always
  so. At<br>different times during the reign of the Ming dynasty, the ports of Ningpo
  and<br>Chusan in Chekeang, and the port of Amoy in Fuhkeen, were opened to Europeans,<br>and
  became large marts for their commerce. Kanghe in the twenty third year of<br>his
  reign opened all the ports of his empire, and allowed a<br><em>free trade</em>to
  his own subjects and to all foreign nations. This regulation continued in<br>force
  for about thirty years. But at length it was argued against this<br>regulation,
  that foreigners and adventurous Chinese who were living abroad would<br>improverish
  the country by exporting large quantities of rice! For this, or some<br>other reasons
  equally cogent, foreign trade was restricted; the emigration of<br>natives and the
  ingress of foreigners, were prohibited; and, if we mistake not,<br>the building
  of vessels on the European model was likewise interdicted. â€”<br><em>Chinese Rep.</em>
