transcription: "<p>  *The Advertiser of the 19  <sup>th</sup>  of last December contained
  the following article:</p><p>  <em>To all whom it may concern.</em>  —From what
  we can learn, we have great reason to believe that a  <em>determination</em>  has
  been formed to BREAK UP the  <em>negro school</em>  in Canterbury by some means
  or other in less than two months. We by no means  wish to encourage such a determination.
  And we seriously hope that our belief  is not sufficiently authorized.—The best
  way is to wait patiently and let the  law take its own course, and to let all doubts
  as to its constitutionality be  indulged to their utmost extent. The peaceable and
  undisturbed manner however,  in which the Instructress has of late been permitted
  to go on with her school,  in violation of a law which the  <em>people</em>  of
  this state have deliberately enacted could hardly have been expected by  her. And
  we have no hesitation in saying that but few towns in this or  <em>any other</em>
  \ State, would have shown so much forbearance towards such an establishment, as
  \ have the people of Canterbury. We were not aware until we were so informed by
  \ our correspondent last week, that the number of the scholars now in attendance
  \ at the abolition school was so great. We know that great efforts have been  made
  by its abettors,  <em>since the decision</em>  of Chief Justice Daggett, to fill
  up the benches of the school house, and to  increase the grievances and insults
  of our citizens, but we did not know until  recently that, those efforts had succeeded
  to the amount of “more than  <em>thirty</em>  wenches,” who are sent from all quarters
  of the globe!</p>"
Scholarly Notes: "<em><br>   There has to be a term, other than disingenuous, for
  the Cyril of<br>  Alexandria-style crocodile tears, or the Trumpesque “dog whistle”
  to describe<br>  this stuff.<br></em><br><em><br>  Kathleen Turner sent me “stochastic
  terrorism” and Marjorie Shelton “a wink<br>  and a nod”<br></em><br>"
Commentary: Note here the insulting language of “wenches” but also the high number
  of thirty students!
