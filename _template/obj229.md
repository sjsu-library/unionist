transcription: In an advertisement for <br><em>Daughter’s Own Book,<br>comprising
  letters from a Father to his Daughter.</em> six positive reviews are cited, including
  the final one being from<br><em>The Unionist</em>. That states “It is the most valuable
  treatise that has been<br>published, and we recommend it to every parent and daughter
  in our country.” <br><br>
Scholarly Notes: One other review quotation of interest comes from <br><em>Zion’s
  Herald</em>, contending that the book<br>“furnishes much excellent instruction on
  the culture and discipline of the<br>female mind.”
Commentary: It is not clear that the quote from <em>The Unionist</em> is really from
  a "review" - it formed part of the copy in the advertisement for the book in the
  December 19, 1833 issue!
