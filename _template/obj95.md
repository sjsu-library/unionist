transcription: <p align="right">FOR THE UNIONIST.</p><p>  MR EDITOR,—I was pleased
  to notice the account of the “training” which  appeared in your columns of last
  week. I have often wondered that a system so  useless—(to say nothing of its pernicious
  influence on public morals) and so  evidently unpopular among the people should
  so generally have escaped the  censure of the press.</p><p>  The evils attendant
  on the training system are great—  <em>they are felt in this community,</em>  and
  ought to be exposed by every friend of justice and by every lover of good  order
  in society.—I rejoice to perceive that you understand the best mode of  treating
  the subject. Sound and sober argument will have no influence with  those who advocate
  the present miserable system of militia trainings. Ridicule  has done more to bring
  about a reform in this system than all the arguments  that have ever been urged
  against it.</p><p>  As it is the professed object of your paper to promote the cause
  of justice  and of sound morals it is to be hoped you will not let this subject
  drop. You  will be sustained by this community, and by exposing the unequal operations
  of  the militia law, its uselessness, &amp; its pernicious consequences, you will  merit
  and receive the thanks of the  people.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  W.</p><p>  P.S.
  I am obliged to you Mr Editor, for the definition of the term  “spirit-stirring-drum.”
  There are some other terms in the soldiers vocabulary  that require a satisfactory
  explanation.</p><p></p>
Scholarly Notes: It is significant that the letter writers all have to use pseudonmys.
  Not an uncommon practice, but potentially indicates community hostility.
Commentary: 'This letter from "W." concerns militia training laws. Apparently a critique
  of these militia training laws had been included in <em>The Unionist</em> issue
  of August 29, 1833 (1:5). This now-missing article also included a critique of the
  "spirit-stirring-drum." These ideas are congruent with Jonathan Dymond''s anti-war
  writings. '
