transcription: "“THE UNIONIST.”—This is the title of a new paper lately established
  in Brooklyn, Conn, and is edited with considerable tact, by Mr. C.C. Burleigh. The
  object of the editor seems to be, to sustain Miss Crandall in her negro business,—and
  to cut short the influence of our brother typo, the editor of the Advertiser. Brooklyn
  is celebrated for creating newspaper establishments, but the people “don’t take,”
  or some other reason, causes them to sicken and die very soon after they are brought
  into being. The practice of starting newspapers in every town containing 500 inhabitants,
  as is prevalent at the present day, is very much to be deprecated. The projectors
  too frequently neglect to “count the cost,” and they soon find that a large amount
  is invested but little profit realized. How the case may be with the “Unionist,”
  we know not. But if the editor fulfils his promise contained in the prospectus,
  to “advocate temperance, virtue and sound morality,” we must earnestly wish him
  success in the undertaking."
