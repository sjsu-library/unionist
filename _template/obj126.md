transcription: "<em>Ten miles of Paper.</em>—Paper used to be sold by the sheet, the
  quire, or the ream;&nbsp; but in “themarch of improvement,” stationary will not
  remain stationary, and so it is nowsold by measure. The following order was received
  from a pottery firm the otherday. The writer, it will be observed, gives his orders
  with as much indifferenceas though they were not at all extraordinary:—“Gentlemen—Please
  to send us tenmiles of your best printing tissue paper, in length; 6 miles to be
  30 inchesbroad, 4 miles 22 inches broad—to be wrapped on wooden rollers, according
  to theplan given to Mr. George Fourdrinier.” The object of having the paper of suchgreat
  length is that it may be printed from engraved cylinders, in the same wayas calicoes,
  &amp;c."
