Scholarly Notes: 
Commentary: 'Prentice & Tibbets was not an ordinary business, but one led by men of
  strong anti-slavery sentiments. John Prentice attended the 1833 organizational meeting
  of the American Anti-Slavery Society. In fact, John Prentice introduced a motion
  at the meeting in approbation of Prudence Crandall and the Canterbury Female Academy.
  Similarly, he was in the Providence Anti-Slavery Association, where, in 1833, he
  served as Treasurer. Others on hte board include Henry E. Benson and Ray Potter.

  Brief Exposition of the Principles and Purposes of the Abolitionists.&nbsp;</em><br>  Providence:
