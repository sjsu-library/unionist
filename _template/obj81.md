transcription: TATTLING. “He that keepeth his mouth, keepeth his life.” It is very
  common foryoung persons to tell every thing they hear, whether they have any grounds
  forthe belief of what they hear or not. To the injury of an individual somethingmay
  be said and spread abroad, when there is not the least shadow of truth inthe story.
  And it is against this species of tattling which I wish to guardmankind. The wise
  man knew how prone the world was to this sin when he said,—“hethat keepeth his mouth
  keepeth his life.” And truly that person who is carefulwhat he says—especially when
  he knows it is in his power to injure the characterof a person, or thwart any of
  his purposes—acts up to the proverb, and gains theesteem and friendship of his fellows.—<em>Juvenile
  Watchman</em>
