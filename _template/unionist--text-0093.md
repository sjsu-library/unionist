transcription: <p align="right">FOR THE UNIONIST.</p><p>  Mr. Editor. It is truly
  astonishing to witness the efforts at<br>  misrepresentation in the last Advertiser
  respecting Miss Crandall’s trial.—It<br>  is the part of wisdom in the many correspondents
  to that paper that they have<br>  not signed their names to the articles communicated.
  An article appears headed<br>  this, “Effects of abolition principles in a Court
  of Justice.” The writer<br>  attempts, in his way, to question the veracity of persons
  who were called upon<br>  to testify, when they said that they had drank tea with
  Miss Crandall and her<br>  scholars but could not recollect the countenances of
  any who were then in<br>  court. From this circumstance the writer wishes to convey
  the idea to his<br>  readers that they were guilty of swearing falsely, and thus
  were it in his<br>  power, would he fix upon them the seal of infamy. The writer
  of that article<br>  should know, that however much honorable men may differ from
  him in sentiment,<br>  merely a difference of opinion does not render them incapable
  of speaking the<br>  truth, and whenever he touches upon an honorable man’s character,
  he touches a<br>  very tender spot. However lightly he may regard it,—character,
  in the<br>  estimation of some men—some abolitionists we trust—ay, even some who
  have had<br>  the hardihood to<br>  <em>sit at the same table</em>  with Miss Crandall
  and her colored misses—is above all price. The writer<br>  thinks it is a most incredible
  circumstance that a person could drink tea with<br>  20 misses whom he never saw
  before, and 2 or 3 months afterwards, when he<br>  should see misses in a public
  assembly, could not recollect that they were the<br>  persons with whom he drank
  tea. Perhaps they were present at the table, and<br>  perhaps they were not. But
  suppose they were—would it be any thing strange for<br>  a<br>  <em>gentleman</em>  to
  sit down at table with 20 misses, half of them perhaps, sitting in a direct<br>  line
  with himself, (so that it would be extremely difficult for him to see<br>  them)
  and not seeing their countenances so as immediately to recollect them<br>  when
  seen a number of weeks afterwards, with their bonnets on—in a different<br>  attire—in
  a “court of Justice?” Surely these gentlemen—as they said they could<br>  not recollect
  them—must be set down as liars, for no one can doubt—considering<br>  the circumstances—that
  there was a<br>  <em>reasonable possibility</em>  of their not knowing them at a
  glance—whether they were there or not. We would<br>  advise the writer of that article
  to look up much reckless villains and have<br>  them tried for perjury.<br></p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>  JUSTICE.<br></p>
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: It is worth noting the sarcastic emphasis this letter-writer gives to
  the notion of sharing the table with the Black students at the Canterbury Female
  Academy. This suggests that there were members of the white community who were "unlearning"
  their racism - and recognizing the racist presumptions in others.
