scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: '<p>  This quote (paraphrased here) made the rounds of the Peace Movement
  in the 19<br>  <sup>th</sup>  century. Bishop Richard Watson of Llandaff (1737-1816)
  had said this during a speech “in the House of Lords, against entering into a commercial
  treaty with<br>  France, as reported in Debrett’s Parliamentary Register” (166)
  – Here is the<br>  full paragraph<br></p><p>  " Would&nbsp; to&nbsp; God,&nbsp;
  My&nbsp; Lords,&nbsp; he&nbsp; said,&nbsp;<br>  that&nbsp; the&nbsp; spirit&nbsp;
  of&nbsp; the Christian&nbsp; religion&nbsp;<br>  would&nbsp; exert&nbsp; its&nbsp;
  influence&nbsp; over&nbsp; the&nbsp;<br>  hearts&nbsp; of individuals&nbsp; in&nbsp;
  their&nbsp; public&nbsp;<br>  capacity,&nbsp; as&nbsp; much &nbsp;as,&nbsp; we&nbsp;
  trust,&nbsp; it&nbsp;<br>  does over&nbsp; their&nbsp; conduct&nbsp; in&nbsp; private&nbsp;
  life;&nbsp;<br>  then&nbsp; would&nbsp; revenge,&nbsp; avarice, and&nbsp; ambition,&nbsp;<br>  which&nbsp;
  have&nbsp; fattened&nbsp; the&nbsp; earth&nbsp; with&nbsp;<br>  the&nbsp; blood&nbsp;
  of her&nbsp; children,&nbsp; be&nbsp; banished&nbsp;<br>  from&nbsp; the&nbsp; councils&nbsp;
  of&nbsp; princes,&nbsp; and&nbsp; there<br>  would&nbsp; be&nbsp; no&nbsp; more&nbsp;
  war.&nbsp; The&nbsp; time&nbsp;<br>  will&nbsp; come,&nbsp; the&nbsp; prophet&nbsp;
  hath said&nbsp; it,&nbsp;<br>  and&nbsp; I&nbsp; believe&nbsp; it,&nbsp; the&nbsp;
  time&nbsp; will&nbsp;<br>  assuredly&nbsp; come,&nbsp; when&nbsp; nation, literally&nbsp;
  speaking,&nbsp;<br>  shall&nbsp; no&nbsp; longer&nbsp; lift&nbsp; up&nbsp; hand&nbsp;
  against&nbsp;<br>  nation.&nbsp; No man&nbsp; will&nbsp; rejoice,&nbsp; My&nbsp;
  Lords,&nbsp;<br>  more&nbsp; than&nbsp; I&nbsp; shall,&nbsp; to&nbsp; see&nbsp;
  the&nbsp; time<br>  when&nbsp; peace&nbsp; shall&nbsp; depend&nbsp; on&nbsp; an&nbsp;<br>  obedience&nbsp;
  to&nbsp; the&nbsp; benevolent principles&nbsp; of&nbsp;<br>  the&nbsp; Gospel;&nbsp;
  but&nbsp; whilst&nbsp; it&nbsp; is&nbsp; simply&nbsp;<br>  made&nbsp; to&nbsp; depend
  on&nbsp; the&nbsp; selfish&nbsp; prospects&nbsp;<br>  of&nbsp; commercial&nbsp;
  policy,&nbsp; I&nbsp; can&nbsp; have&nbsp; no<br>  &nbsp;con-fidence in&nbsp; its&nbsp;
  continuance&nbsp; ;&nbsp; it&nbsp;<br>  will&nbsp; not&nbsp; last&nbsp; a&nbsp;
  moment&nbsp; longer&nbsp; than<br>  till&nbsp; it&nbsp; is&nbsp; the&nbsp; interest,&nbsp;
  real&nbsp; or&nbsp;<br>  apparent,&nbsp; of&nbsp; France&nbsp; to&nbsp; break&nbsp;
  it.” (168)<br></p><p>  <em>    Anecdotes of the Life of Richard Watson, Bishop of
