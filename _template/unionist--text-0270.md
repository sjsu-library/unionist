scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: 'At some point, <em>The Unionist</em> reviewed this work by Orin Fowler,
  as can be seen from this blurb: <p>  "Fowler on the Evils of using Tobacco.—We are
  anxious to see this work<br>  extensively circulated, for we are confident that
  it will do good. The<br>  pamphlet contains much valuable information, and will
  be found well worth an<br>  attentive and frequent perusal."<br></p><p align="right">  <em>The
  Unionist</em>  , Brooklyn, Conn.<br></p>Orin Fowler (1791-1852) is a fascinating
  character, with many connections to the Burleighs. For more on this pamphlet against
  smoking, it can be accessed online here:  https://www.gutenberg.org/files/24366/24366-h/24366-h.htm
  . Tim Crumrin''s blog post, "Noxious Weed," places Fowler''s pamphlet in context
  -  https://www.vchsmuseum.org/post/noxious-weed . But in addition to this prescient
  struggle against tobacco, Fowler was a two-term Congressman, and an anti-slavery
  man. In an 1850 speech on the floor of the House, he spoke these memorable words
  about the despicable institution: <p>  “we must know what American slavery is. A
  constituent element is one thing, a<br>  relation is another thing, an appendage
  is another. What is the intrinsic, the<br>  unchanging, the essential element of
  American slavery? I answer, American<br>  slavery reduces man — a man created free,
  and equal to all other men — it<br>  reduces him to property. It makes free, moral
  agents, chattels. It converts<br>  persons into things — it sinks a rational creature
  into merchandise. An<br>  American slave can own nothing — can acquire nothing.
  Slavery annuls his right<br>  to himself. If he uses these terms — my hands, my
  eyes, my tongue, my body, my<br>  mind, myself— they are mere figures of speech.
  If an American slave uses<br>  himself for his own benefit, he commits a crime.
  If he keeps and appropriates<br>  what he earns, he is thereby a thief. To take
  his own body into his own<br>  keeping, is insurrection ; and death must be his
  doom for the deed, if he<br>  persevere. American slavery subjects men like ourselves,
  to be bartered,<br>  mortgaged, bequeathed, invoiced, shipped in cargoes, stored
  as other goods,<br>  taken on execution, as are cattle, and knocked off at public
  auction. It makes<br>  a man''s rights — a man''s deathless nature — a man''s conscience,
  affections,<br>  sympathies, hopes — a marketable commodity. It robs him, not of
  privileges,<br>  but of himself. It loads him, not with burdens, but makes him a
  beast of<br>  burden. It restrains not liberty — it subverts it. It does not curtail
  rights<br>  — it abolishes them. In a word, American slavery sinks man into a machine
  —<br>  annihilates personality — despoils a human being of rational attributes —<br>  unmans
  a man. Such is American slavery."<br></p><p>Orin Fowler, <em>  Slavery in California
  and New Mexico: speech of Mr. Orin Fowler, of<br>  Massachusetts, in the House of
  Representatives, March 11, 1850 ...<br></em>&nbsp;[Washington, D.C.]: Buell &amp;
  Blanchard, 1850.</p> <p>The direct connection to the Burleighs comes much earlier
  in his career than this, though.  Fowler was a member of the Windham County Peace
  Society (Larned, Vol. II, p. 391), and when Fowler served at the Congregational
  Church in Plainfield, Rinaldo Burleigh (father of Charles and William) served as
  Deacon under him (Larned, Vol. II, p. 418) <br><br><br><br>'
