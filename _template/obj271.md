transcription: "<p>  THE LADY’S BOOK,<br>  <em>    a monthly Magazine, of original
  and selected Tales, Poetry, Essays, and<br>    Music, embellished with several hundred
  engravings, and quarterly plates of<br>    the Philadelphia Fashions, superbly colored.<br>
  \ </em></p><p>  When, about four years ago, the Lady’s Book was submitted to the
  test of<br>  publication; the proprietors made no professions likely to create expectations<br>
  \ which they could anticipate even an improbability of realizing: they were<br>
  \ determined nevertheless progressively to adopt every improvement which<br>  diligent
  anxiety to please their patrons should suggest; and have now the<br>  remunerating
  satisfaction, after having faithfully and steadily pursued their<br>  course, of
  seeing it sanctioned by a circulation more extensive than that of<br>  any other
  monthly journal in the United States, and as this extent of<br>  patronage is the
  most admissible evidence of its past utility, it is offered<br>  as the best guarantee
  for its future excellence. The literary department of<br>  the Lady’s Book is of
  admitted superiority; for in conjunction with the great<br>  but boasted liberality
  with which they encourage the development of<br>  <em>Native Authors,</em>  they
  possess facilities of selection, through their foreign agents and<br>  correspondents
  from works of which<br>  <em>no other copies</em>  are sent to this country.<br></p><p>
  \ Among the many claims which the Lady’s Book has on the patronage of Americans,<br>
  \ the least is not, that it was the first publication to present correct<br>  representations
  of the newest fashions of female costume, and in that respect<br>  it may fairly
  claim a superiority over all other contemporaries: for we<br>  proprietors seldom
  calculate the expense of rendering it altogether deserving<br>  of its increased
  and increasing patrons.<br></p><p>  Never was the title of a book more justified
  by its contents than that of the<br>  Lady’s Book—Literature, foreign and domestic—selected
  and original—Engravings<br>  on steel and wood, of scenery, distinguished persons,
  fashions and embroidery,<br>  all rich and beautiful, and from the hands of the
  most eminent artists. Its<br>  literature select, free from dullness, though teeming
  with usefulness, and<br>  conveying pleasure and amusement through the extensive
  medium of delicate<br>  discrimination. To musical amateurs of both sexes, the Lady’s
  Book offers many<br>  advantages, each number being accompanied by a popular piece,
  arranged with<br>  accompaniments for the piano forte, &amp;c &amp;c. under the<br>
  \ <em>surveillance</em>  of competent persons, and to its pages the general reader
  can always turn and<br>  find amusement, novelty, and instruction.<br></p><p>  Each
  number shall, as hitherto, average 60 pages of extra royal octavo letter<br>  press,
  printed with clear, new and beautiful type, on paper of the finest<br>  texture
  and whitest colour. It will continue to be embellished with the most<br>  splendid
  engravings on copper and steel, embracing every variety of subject,<br>  and the
  quarterly numbers will as heretofore contain figures of Philadelphia<br>  Fashions,
  two and occasionally three, beautifully and faithfully colored, to<br>  commence
  with the January number, being No. 1 of the eighth volume. It may be<br>  necessary
  to say that these engravings are designed, drawn and engraved,<br>  expressly for
  this work, by competent persons, specially engaged for that<br>  purpose.<br></p><p>
