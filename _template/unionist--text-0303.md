transcription: "<p>  ABOLITION OF SLAVERY IN ANTIGUA.—We have received an Antigua
  paper of Feb. 19<br>  <sup>th</sup>  , from which we learn that the Legislature
  of that Colony had passed an Act<br>  for the total Abolition of Slavery on the
  1<br>  <sup>st</sup>  of August next. On the 21<br>  <sup>st</sup>  . November,
  the Governor, at the instance of the Legislature, addressed the<br>  British Government,
  desiring to know whether immediate and unconditional<br>  abolition on the 1<br>
  \ <sup>st</sup>  of August, would be accepted by the Government, in lieu of the
  system of<br>  gradual emancipation contemplated by the Act of Parliament. On the
  13<br>  <sup>th</sup>  of Feb. a reply having been received by the Governor, the
  Legislature met by<br>  special summons. The reply was then read, announcing that
  the wishes of the<br>  Legislature were perfectly consistent with the views of the
  government, and<br>  with the spirit of the Act of Parliament. Thereupon an act
  was passed by the<br>  Assembly on the 13<br>  <sup>th</sup>  Feb., and by the Council
  on the 15<br>  <sup>th</sup>  , of which the following is the principal section:<br></p><p>
  \ Sec. 1.—<br>  <em>May it please your most Excellent Majesty,</em>  That it may
  be enacted, and be it enacted by the Governor and Commander in<br>  Chief of Your
  Majesty’s Islands of Antigua, Montserrat, Barbuda, Saint<br>  Christopher, Nevis,
  Anguilla, the Virgin Islands and Dommica and the Council<br>  and Assembly of this
  Your Majesty’s Islands of Antigua, and it is hereby<br>  enacted and ordained, by
  the authority of the same, that all and every person,<br>  who on the first day
  of August, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-four,<br>  shall be holden in slavery
  within this Colony or its dependencies, shall upon<br>  and from and after the said
  first day of August one thousand eight hundred and<br>  thirty-four, become, and
  be to all intents and purposes FREE, and discharged<br>  of and from all manner
  of Slavery, and of and from the obligations imposed by<br>  the said herein before
  in part recited Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom<br>  of Great Britain and
  Ireland, entitled “An Act for the Abolition of Slavery<br>  throughout the British
  Colonies, for promoting the Industry of Manumitted<br>  Slaves, and for compensating
  the persons hitherto entitled to the services of<br>  such Slaves;” and shall be
  absolutely and forever Manumitted; and that the<br>  children thereafter to be born
  to any such persons, and the offspring of such<br>  children, shall in like manner
  be free from their birth; and that from and<br>  after the said first day of August,
  one thousand eight hundred and<br>  thirty-four, Slavery shall be, and is hereby
  utterly and forever abolished,<br>  and declared unlawful within this colony and
  its dependencies.<br></p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  The vote<br>  was unanimous. When signing the bill, the Speaker said, in a tone
  audible only<br>  to those very near him. “The most important paper to which I ever
  put my<br>  hand.”<br></p>"
