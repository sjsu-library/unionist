transcription: "<em>A New Theory.</em>—Dr. S.M. Metcalf has just published a work
  in which he endeavors to show, that<br>terrestrial magnetism and electricity are
  the same; and that “most striking<br>analogies of caloric and electricity shew that
  they are radically the same<br>subtle, imponderable, and all pervading element;
  that its unequal distribution<br>thro’-out nature, is the cause of all the various
  attractions of ponderable<br>matter.”—<br><em>N.Y. Bap. Reg.</em>"
