transcription: "“MYSTERIOUS AFFAIR. We learn from the Brooklyn Unionist, that on Tuesdayafternoon,
  27th ult. about 2 o’clock, the house of Miss CRANDALL, theinstructress of colored
  youths in Canterbury, was discovered to be&nbsp;<em>on fire</em>, in a place and
  under circumstances which rendered the origin of itinexplicable. The flame and smoke
  burst out from the corner of one of the roomsfarthest from the chimney and fire
  place, but the inmates of the house with theassistance of&nbsp; the neighboring
  villagers succeeded in putting it out. Thiswould readily be supposed to be accidental,
  had not public threats beenpreviously made to&nbsp;<em>effectually break up Miss
  C’s school.</em>&nbsp;If, as is suspected, it shall prove to be the work of any
  of those opposedto the&nbsp; efforts of this young lady—they may take back the ignoble
  epithetof&nbsp;<em>‘incendiary’</em>&nbsp;with which they have frequently hailed
  the abolitionists, and wear it likeCain, branded on their foreheads.—<em>N. Bedford
  Workingmen’s Press.</em>”"
Scholarly Notes: 
Commentary: This account - from the <em>New Bedford Workingmen's Press</em> via <em>The
  Liberator</em> - is best described as a close paraphrase of the material that was
  published in <em>The Unionist</em>
