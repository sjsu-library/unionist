transcription: '<p>  "Mr. Judson’s Circular,” from the<br>  <em>Genius of Temperance</em>  ,
  in<br>  <em>The Unionist</em>  1:2:3, column 4<br></p><p>  MR. JUDSON’S CIRCULAR—
  We have seen a Circular written by Andrew T. Judson,<br>  Canterbury, in vindication
  of his conduct towards Miss Crandall, and in favor<br>  of the new law, under which
  she was imprisoned. It is a very lame affair: much<br>  more so than we should have
  expected from a lawyer, aspiring to a seat in<br>  Congress. He does not even make
  a<br>  <em>plausible</em>  defence. The very<br>  <em>plea</em>  must insure<br>  <em>condemnation</em>  among
  republicans. Miss Crandall’s school, according to Mr. Judson, is to be<br>  legislated
  down—<br>  <em>not</em>  because colored people are not human beings—“created free
  and equal”—not<br>  because they are not entitled to education—<br>  <em>not</em>  because
  the object is undesirable—<br>  <em>not</em>  because Miss Crandall was incompetent
  to teach them—<br>  <em>not</em>  because the town was in danger (as had been pretended)
  of being overrun with<br>  paupers, but because Miss Crandall is an<br>  <em>abolitionist!</em>  A
  fine TEST ACT, truly! Why not because she is a Baptist? A large portion of<br>  the
  Baptists, and of other sects, we trust, are rapidly embracing the heresy<br>  against
  which “His Grace, the” [American] “Lord Bishop of Canterbury” has<br>  fulminated
  his papal bull. And so the abolitionists are legally disqualified<br>  from school
  teaching, are they? From what will they next be debarred? From<br>  preaching? From
  medical and from legal practice? From buying and selling? as<br>  rumor even now
  reports of Canterbury, and as the Revelator of Patmos has<br>  predicted, of the
  latter days?”&nbsp; (Rev.xiii.17.)<br></p><p>  Mr. Judson pleads in favor of Canterbury
  legislation, that the people of<br>  <em>other</em>  towns, would be as unwilling
  as those of Canterbury, to see a similar school<br>  established, and then to strengthen
  this, by<br>  <em>another</em>  plea, he complains because Miss Crandall did not
  accept his offer to remove<br>  her<br>  <em>location!</em>  This savors of the
  Irish, as well as of the Romish bull! Much in the same vein<br>  of logic, Mr. Judson
  defends the<br>  <em>Connecticut</em>  law, by remarking that schools might be established
  in<br>  <em>other</em>  states! Above all, the<br>  <em>present</em>  law of Connecticut,<br>  <em>against</em>  the
  free and unrestrained education of the colored people, Mr. Judson argues,<br>  <em>cannot</em>  be<br>  <em>bad,</em>  BECAUSE
  a<br>  <em>former</em>  law of that state, (as yet unrepealed—a law,—he<br>  <em>might</em>  have
  said—enacted when<br>  <em>all</em>  the people of Connecticut were “abolitionists,”
  and ere the cunning device of<br>  Colonziationism was dreamed of)—is a<br>  <em>good</em>  one
  and contains<br>  <em>contrary</em>  characteristics!”<br></p><p align="center">“A
  Daniel! still I say, a second Daniel!”</p><p>  Mr. Judson must certainly be sent
  to Congress! –<br>  <em>Genius of Temperance</em></p>'
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: The anti-Catholic sentiment that was always bubbling beneath the surface
  of the Reform movements rears its head in the open for a moment here.
