transcription: "<em>Ten miles of Paper.</em>—Paper used to be sold by the sheet, the
  quire, or the ream;&nbsp; but in “the<br>march of improvement,” stationary will
  not remain stationary, and so it is now<br>sold by measure. The following order
  was received from a pottery firm the other<br>day. The writer, it will be observed,
  gives his orders with as much indifference<br>as though they were not at all extraordinary:—“Gentlemen—Please
  to send us ten<br>miles of your best printing tissue paper, in length; 6 miles to
  be 30 inches<br>broad, 4 miles 22 inches broad—to be wrapped on wooden rollers,
  according to the<br>plan given to Mr. George Fourdrinier.” The object of having
  the paper of such<br>great length is that it may be printed from engraved cylinders,
  in the same way<br>as calicoes, &amp;c.<br>"
