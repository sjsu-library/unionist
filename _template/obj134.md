transcription: "<em>The Americans, by an American.</em>—“The Rev. Calvin Colton has
  written a book entitled ‘The Americans,’ in whichhe gives a deserved castigation
  to Capt. Basil Hall, Mrs. Trollope, and theEnglish Reviewers. This work, which is
  said to be a very clever performance,coming on the back of Mr. Stuart’s, will pretty
  well settle the question withthese traducers of American character and manners."
Scholarly Notes: 
Commentary: 'This book, <em>The Americans, by an American in London</em>, by Calvin
  Colton (1789-1857), can be found here - https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=yale.39002007679153&view=1up&seq=7&q1=american%20colonization%20society
  . It is unlikely that Burleigh had read it, as it contains support for the American
  Colonization Society, which he would not have endorsed.  In this 1833 book, Colton
  sees both the impracticality of the American Colonization Society''s project, and
  the evil of slavery, but still thinks that the Colonization Society is a benevolent
  organization that is gradually raising consciousness around the issue of slavery.
  When he returned to the United States in 1835, though, he became a strident anti-abolitionist,
  even writing a piece titled <em>Abolition, a Sedition</em> in 1839. For a full length
  scholarly article on Colton, see James D. Bratt, “From Revivalism to Anti-Revivalism
  to Whig Politics: The Strange Career of Calvin Colton.” <em>The Journal of Ecclesiastical
  History</em>, vol. 52, no. 1, 2001, pp. 63–82.'
