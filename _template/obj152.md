transcription: "<p>  MRS. CHILD’ S ‘APPEAL.” Seldom has any work more richly repaid
  us for the time<br>  spent in its perusal than Mrs. Child’s ‘Appeal,’ of which an
  advertisement<br>  will be found in another column.—Written in a style, easy, simple
  and elegant;<br>  enlivened with occasional flashes of wit, rich in important facts,
  happy<br>  illustrations and forcible, conclusive reasoning—its satire delicate
  but keen;<br>  its appeals touching and powerful; its reproofs grave, just and severe,
  yet<br>  couched in language courteous and dignified—it is altogether one of the
  most<br>  valuable publications which have for a long time fallen under our eye.
  We were<br>  particularly struck with the appearance of extensive research which<br>
  \ characterizes the work/ The gifted authoress lays under contribution; law,<br>
  \ history and political science, the productions of human genius, and the<br>  records
  of divine inspiration, and with admirable skill and taste combines the<br>  materials
  drawn from these several sources, into one finished piece of neat<br>  &amp; polished
  workmanship. As a powerful auxiliary to the Anti-Slavery cause,<br>  we feel unable
  to express our high opinion of its value, and we would only<br>  express our ardent
  wish that a copy might be placed in the hands of every<br>  friend and every enemy
  of our cause, for the former an armory well stored<br>  with&nbsp; weapons of approved
  temper to arm him for combat in the righteous<br>  cause, to the latter the means
  of overcoming his opposition, and bringing him<br>  to enlist under the banner of
  justice, and defend the rights of the oppressed.<br></p><p>  To us it appears impossible
  for any candid mind and unprejudiced person to<br>  read this book with the&nbsp;
  attention it merits both for the importance of<br>  the subject and for the manner
  in which&nbsp; it is treated, without becoming<br>  a decided Abolitionist. We can
  confidently recommend the work to all who feel<br>  interested either way on the
  subject of slavery, Colonization, and Abolition,<br>  to all who would wish for
  a great amount of information&nbsp; on these<br>  interesting topics, compressed
  into a small space, and to all who would see an<br>  important subject handled with&nbsp;
  fairness, ingenuity and ability, and we<br>  need not add—so well is Mrs. Child
  known in the reading community—to all<br>  lovers of fine writing.—<br>  <em>Unionist</em></p>"
Scholarly Notes: guessing at date in Unionist
Commentary: Just as Garrison had shown, by publishing works by Black writers male
  and female, Charles C. Burleigh here shows himself to be pro-feminist in praising
  a woman's writing without diminishing it in any way.
