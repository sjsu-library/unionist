transcription: "<p>  MRS. CHILD’ S ‘APPEAL.” Seldom has any work more richly repaid
  us for the time  spent in its perusal than Mrs. Child’s ‘Appeal,’ of which an advertisement
  \ will be found in another column.—Written in a style, easy, simple and elegant;
  \ enlivened with occasional flashes of wit, rich in important facts, happy  illustrations
  and forcible, conclusive reasoning—its satire delicate but keen;  its appeals touching
  and powerful; its reproofs grave, just and severe, yet  couched in language courteous
  and dignified—it is altogether one of the most  valuable publications which have
  for a long time fallen under our eye. We were  particularly struck with the appearance
  of extensive research which  characterizes the work/ The gifted authoress lays under
  contribution; law,  history and political science, the productions of human genius,
  and the  records of divine inspiration, and with admirable skill and taste combines
  the  materials drawn from these several sources, into one finished piece of neat
  \ &amp; polished workmanship. As a powerful auxiliary to the Anti-Slavery cause,
  \ we feel unable to express our high opinion of its value, and we would only  express
  our ardent wish that a copy might be placed in the hands of every  friend and every
  enemy of our cause, for the former an armory well stored  with&nbsp; weapons of
  approved temper to arm him for combat in the righteous  cause, to the latter the
  means of overcoming his opposition, and bringing him  to enlist under the banner
  of justice, and defend the rights of the oppressed.</p><p>  To us it appears impossible
  for any candid mind and unprejudiced person to  read this book with the&nbsp; attention
  it merits both for the importance of  the subject and for the manner in which&nbsp;
  it is treated, without becoming  a decided Abolitionist. We can confidently recommend
  the work to all who feel  interested either way on the subject of slavery, Colonization,
  and Abolition,  to all who would wish for a great amount of information&nbsp; on
  these  interesting topics, compressed into a small space, and to all who would see
  an  important subject handled with&nbsp; fairness, ingenuity and ability, and we
  \ need not add—so well is Mrs. Child known in the reading community—to all  lovers
  of fine writing.—  <em>Unionist</em></p>"
Scholarly Notes: guessing at date in Unionist
Commentary: Just as Garrison had shown, by publishing works by Black writers male
  and female, Charles C. Burleigh here shows himself to be pro-feminist in praising
  a woman's writing without diminishing it in any way.
