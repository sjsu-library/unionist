  some dozen of his<br>neighbors had followed a constable with a vagrant in charge,
  to see how<br>the magistrate would make out, determined to strike them dumb with
  awe. He<br>sentenced the poor culprit to twenty hours’ imprisonment—and concluded
  with all<br>possible solemnity, “And the Lord have mercy on your soul!”<br>"
