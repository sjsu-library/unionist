transcription: EGYPTIAN NEWSPAPER.—A journal is now published at Alexandria, under
  the title ofMiszer Wekaiesi (Egyptian News.). The Vignette of this paper, in opposition
  tothe Ottoman Crescent, presents half a sun, shining forth from behind a pyramid,on
  the side of which stands a flourishing young palm tree. On the left of thevignette
  are these words:—“Printed at the office of the<em>Divan of Events</em>in the Royal
  Castle.”—This paper, which is in the Arabic and Turkish languages,gives no political
  news, but is confined to civil and military subjects, whichhave merely a local interest.
