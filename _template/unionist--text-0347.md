commentary: '<p>  This same William Hutchins, most likely, gave an address declaiming
  equality<br>  of Blacks and whites to the Windham County Colonization Society on
  July 4,<br>  1834 – in notes in totality here&nbsp; “A Heathenish Doctor: Genuine<br>  Colonization
  Doctrines!!”<br>  <em>The Liberator</em>  9 May 1835<br></p><p>  [From the Brooklyn,
  Ct. Advertiser] –<br>  <strong>this was from a speech given July 4, 1834</strong>  [WLG
  inserts the important footnote – “This is a wilful and flagrant<br>  falsehood.
  The address was ably reviewed, at the time, in the columns of the<br>  Brooklyn
  Unionist, by its intelligent editor, Mr. Burleigh, who challenged the<br>  heathenish
  doctor to a public discussion.—ED. LIB.”] Dr. William Hutchins<br>  (1804-1845)
