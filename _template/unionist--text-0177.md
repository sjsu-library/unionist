  to the public</em></p><p>  In presenting to the public the October number of the
  LADY’S BOOK, the<br>  Proprietors feel much pleasure in inviting attention to a
  comparison between<br>  it and the preceding numbers. It will be perceived that
  a gradual, but decided<br>  improvement, has been effected in its embellishments;
  particularly in the<br>  department of costume fashions, which have been executed
  by KELLY; an artist<br>  who, in the Embellishment which accompanies this, has literally
  excelled<br>  himself; rendering the prints of Fashions of the LADY’S BOOK sufficiently<br>  excellent
  to compete with the best executed in London, and to surpass those of<br>  Paris.
  Hence, the public will perceive that the hopes of progressive<br>  improvement,
  which the proprietors of the Lady’s Book have expressed to their<br>  patrons, have
  been fully realized.<br></p><p>  A very material change is observable in the reading
  department of the Lady’s<br>  Book which improvement will proceed, to, at least,
  be sustained, by the<br>  exertions of its contributors; and, as a further expression
  of their gratitude<br>  to a patronizing community, the publication for January,
  1834, will contain<br>  twenty-four additional pages, and the whole number will
  be exclusively devoted<br>  to and composed of ORIGINAL subjects—every article written
  expressly for the<br>  work.<br></p><p>  Among the contributors on this occasion
  may be enumerated Miss Leslie, author<br>  of the Prize Tale entitled “Mrs. Washington
  Potts”—Mrs. Hentz, author of the<br>  Prize Tragedy—the late Mrs. Gilbert—Joseph
  R. Chandler, Esq.—J.A. Shea, author<br>  of Adolph, Address to the Ocean, &amp;c.—the
  author of “A Tale of Fashionable<br>  Life”­—the author of “Sketches of a Jurist-Consult”—Y.P—A.E.—and
  other<br>  well-known and popular writers, whose productions have given so peculiar
  a<br>  delight to the readers of the Lady’s Book. This publication has been always<br>  distinguished
  for its beautiful engravings of the Fashions, but it is the<br>  intention of the
  proprietors to render the one for January still more splendid<br>  than the previous
  ones. The public will perceive that, without heralding it by<br>  professions, a
  reference to past experience is the best promise of future<br>  exertions, which
  it shall be the publishers’ study to render both prompt and<br>  pleasing.<br></p>
