transcription: "<p>  “If the Unionist is determined not to understand, but to misconceive,
  we<br>  cannot be responsible. If we have been “unjust,” we are ready to make<br>
  \ amends—but the “severity” must in all probability be laid at the door of<br>  truth,
  and the latter will take care of herself. All that we have to say is,<br>  that
  we have not wittingly “misrepresented” any body. We have spoken of the<br>  abolitionists
  with freedom, and shall do it again. Their designs are of a<br>  character that
  do not require that we should be very mincing in our words, or<br>  exceeding choice
  of our language. We mean, at all times, that it shall be<br>  decent and respectful,
  for the sake of the public—but we are not aware of any<br>  peculiar obligation
  that we are under to suit our phrases to the holiday<br>  conceptions of those from
  whom we differ. We disclaimed, expressly, the<br>  justice of retorting railing
  for tailing, and yet the Unionist suppresses the<br>  disclaimer totally, and<br>
  \ <em>yet treats us as if we justified it.</em>  This is a specimen, we presume,
  of abolitionist propriety. The Unionist says—<br></p><p>  <strong>    “We do not
  wish the free states to ‘meddle with property at the south,” or<br>    to interfere
  in any shape or form, with slavery at the south, except by<br>    legal and constitutional
  methods. Our only meddling is such as almost all<br>    the papers in the land have
  been guilty of, whenever they have denounced<br>    Russian tyranny, or sympathized
  with Polish patriots suffering under<br>    imperial despotism. In short the only
  medling of which we are, or wish to be<br>    guilty, is the utterance of the truth,
  the exposure of the evils and guilt<br>    of slavery, the asserting and proving
  that its abolition will be for the<br>    good of all parties concerned, the petitioning
  Congress for its abolition in<br>    those parts of the country which are under
  the exclusive jurisdiction of the<br>    General Government.”<br>  </strong></p><p>
  \ Thus pray what is the use of your keeping up this constant agitation at the<br>
  \ North,<br>  <em>where there are no slaves,</em>  and upon what grounds do you
  justify your opposition to, and wholesale abuse<br>  of, the Colonization Society.
  If any person is to be enlightened, it is the<br>  Southern planter. Why not go
  to the South and disperse your lucubrations—if<br>  they are so very cogent, wise,
  and convincing? You are a citizen of the U.<br>  States, and the Constitution guaranties
  the freedom of speech and of the<br>  press. Go to the South, if your zeal is so
  abundant, your logic so good, and<br>  be sure that your effusions will be read.
  If the above extract is the truth,<br>  (and who shall gainsay it?) how does it
  condemn the leaders, (for the Unionist<br>  is too modest to assume that title,)
  how does it, we say, condemn the conduct<br>  of the leaders in this “crusade” against
  the Colonization Society, and the<br>  Constitution. Such as the Unionist may be
  too timid to avow their real<br>  designs—but that the leaders look forward to some
  modification, and if that<br>  cannot be obtained, some infraction of the Constitution,
  few persons opposed<br>  to them have much doubt. If this extract from the Unionist
  speaks the language<br>  of the main body of the abolitionists, they must moderate
  their tone before<br>  the public mind can be convinced. If the above is all they
  aim at, they are<br>  laboring in a hopeless cause.”<br></p>"
scholarlyNotes: 
commentary: 'There is a paragraph in this excerpt that is actual Unionist content.
  This is a response to something that <em>The Unionist</em> published in the issue
  of November 21, 1833 (or, possibly November 14, 1833) '
