transcription: "<p>  We have been requested to publish the following extract from
  an address<br>  delivered by Doct. Wm. Hutchins, before the Windham Co. Colonization
  Society,<br>  at its anniversary held in this town on the 4<br>  <sup>th</sup>  of
  July last. The address referred to, was delivered at a time when the<br>  community
  was highly excited on the slavery question, and a good number of<br>  those, who
  professed to be abolitionists, were present and heart it. And yet<br>  no attempt
  was made at the time to overthrow its arguments, or to counteract<br>  its influence
  upon the public mind.* [Here, WLG inserts the important footnote<br>  – “This is
  a wilful and flagrant falsehood. The address was ably reviewed, at<br>  the time,
  in the columns of the Brooklyn Unionist, by its intelligent editor,<br>  Mr. Burleigh,
  who challenged the heathenish doctor to a public discussion.—ED.<br>  LIB.”]<br></p><p>
  \ It is well known that<br>  <em>equality</em>  in every respect, between our white
  and black population, is a prominent<br>  feature in the abolition creed. For a
  time, but very few of the abolitionists<br>  themselves, were willing to advocate
  this doctrine in public, but they do not<br>  hesitate to do it now, on all occasions.
  If, therefore, any member of that<br>  association is disposed to answer this extract
  in a<br>  <em>direct</em>  and<br>  <em>explicit</em>  manner, he shall have an
  opportunity to do so in the columns of this paper.<br></p><p>[actual speech follows]</p><p>
  \ But, says the abolitionist, this country is the black man’s home as much as it<br>
  \ is yours, and you have no right to drive him from it. Granted. But is it<br>  inconsistent
  with benevolence to wish to better his condition by removing him?<br>  Still it
  is replied, our duty requires us to make this country a pleasant home<br>  to him,
  by removing the civil and social disabilities which now make him what<br>  he is,
  a poor degraded being.<br></p><p>  Let us examine this point a little. The negro,
  in the present state of<br>  society, is denied several political privileges. He
  is deprived of the right<br>  of suffrage. He is excluded from all offices of honor
  and profit. He is<br>  prohibited by public sentiment from practicing in the&nbsp;
  several<br>  professions. He is virtually shut out from many other employments,
  by which<br>  his white neighbor earns distinction and wealth. Now, let the law
  do what it<br>  can for him—let every political disability be removed,—‘tis a<br>
  \ consummation&nbsp; devoutly to be wished—establish institutions for his moral<br>
  \ and intellectual cultivation, and what then? The outworks are indeed forced,<br>
  \ but the citadel remains yet impregnable. He is<br>  <em>black,</em>  and this
  single circumstance, I am bold to say,<br>  <em>    will always be a barrier between
  him and the white, which he&nbsp; cannot<br>    overleap.<br>  </em>  Educated and
  accomplished he may be, and protected by the whole power of the<br>  civil arm,
  still he<br>  <em>    is forever condemned to occupy the lowest point in the scale
  of social life.<br>    No form of philanthropy,<br>  </em>  no legal enactment can
  prevent this. There is an imperium in imperio, an<br>  empire of sentiment and fashion
  and opinion, an authority of nature and<br>  instinct, altogether paramount to all
  written law, and beyond its control. The<br>  negro, if he be allowed to vote by
  your side, must act with you as your equal<br>  every where else. You must meet
  him with a bright smile of joyous<br>  congratulation. You must extend to him all
  the tender charities and courtesies<br>  of social life. You must give him a seat
  at your table, a welcome to your<br>  fireside and to your parlor, a place beside
  you in your bed. You must<br>  reciprocate with him all the elegances and refinements
  of polished society. He<br>  must be your companion and confidential friend by day
  and by night, by the way<br>  side and in the field, in the drawing&nbsp; room of
  the affluent, as well as<br>  in the hut of the indigent. He must be&nbsp; allowed
  to break to you the bread<br>  of life—to prescribe to you&nbsp; in sickness, and
  decide in courts of justice<br>  and halls of legislation, important questions pertaining
  to your life, liberty<br>  and property. In all these things, there must be no constraint,
  but you must<br>  bind him to your heart of hearts, and most freely and unaffectedly,
  share with<br>  him in the delicate sympathies and fond endearments of domestic
  life. If<br>  fortune smiles upon him and frowns upon you, you must be content to
  sit at his<br>  feet and serve him. Unless you go to this full extent, you degrade
  him. Admit<br>  him to a moiety of these privileges, and he will but more keenly
  feel the loss<br>  of the remainder. The higher he goes, the more will his avidity
  increase, to<br>  reach the summit. Keep back a single social or civil right pertaining
  to<br>  entire equality, and that Mordecai in the gate will embitter all his joys,
  and<br>  render unavailable the blushing honors he bears so thick upon him. Such
  is<br>  human nature.<br></p><p>  Now, fellow citizens, need I ask, if it be possible
  to elevate the black man<br>  to an equality with the white? If it be, I give up
  the argument at once. If<br>  the negro can be treated in this country as it becometh
  a man, in whose face<br>  is lighted up the quenchless fire of an undying intellect,
  and on whose brown<br>  God has stamped the indelible signet of immortality, the
  colonization society,<br>  as far as respects the American negro, is laboring in
  a worthless cause.<br>  <em>    Take the negro home to your heart, and embrace him
  as your brother, and you<br>    will save our society much time and expense.<br>
  \ </em></p><p>  Can this be done? I appeal to you not as inhabitants of Heaven or
  of Paradise,<br>  not as angels or glorified saints, but as imperfect men and women,
  tenants of<br>  this nether sphere, in which bitter is mingled with the sweet, and
  thorns<br>  encircle every rose. Are you willing to go all this length in relation
  to the<br>  black man? Can you so far conquer your antipathies as to make him your
  equal<br>  in the true intent and meaning of this term? ABOLITIONISTS, CAN YOU?<br></p><p>
  \ History furnishes no instances of two distinct races of men, holding no<br>  connection
  by blood with each other, living together on terms of perfect<br>  equality. Turn
  its pages over and look through the long and gloomy annals of<br>  the past, and
  you cannot find a single fact of the kind. In order to equality,<br>  there must
  be<br>  <em>amalgamation</em>  or<br>  <em>separation.</em>  When Rome was inundated
  by a deluge of barbarians, the aboriginals of the<br>  country were not exterminated,
  but Hun, Goth, Vandal, and Roman united<br>  together, and gradually blended into
  the modern Italians. When Britain was<br>  overrun by a successive tide of Danes,
  Saxons, and Normans, the ancient<br>  inhabitants were in part driven into Wales,
  and in still larger proportions,<br>  became incorporated with their invaders. All
  past experience is opposed to the<br>  abolition doctrine of ‘prejudice vincible’
  without amalgamation.<br></p><p>  Fellow citizens, take your stand. Look at the
  ultimate results of the<br>  immediate emancipation scheme, and let the overflowings
  of your benevolence be<br>  directed to a union of the two races by ties of consanguinity,
  or to a<br>  separation between them. If the one be revolting to reason and nature,
  and the<br>  other be deemed impossible, then sit down content under a state of
  things<br>  melancholy indeed, but remediless and desperate.<br></p>"
