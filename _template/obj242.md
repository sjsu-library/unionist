  respectable source, to the editor of the National  Gazette (Philadelphia).</p><p>“LANCASTER,
  22d Feb. 1834.</p><p>  We have this day celebrated the birthday of the Father of
  our Country, by  holding a meeting in favor of a restoration of the Federal Deposites.
  It was  the largest and most respectable ever held in this county. We got between
  two  and three thousand signers to our memorials to Congress. It was held without
  \ distinction of parties. The presiding officers and committee men were  principally
  of the Jackson party.”</p>"
