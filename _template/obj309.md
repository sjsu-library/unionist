  paragraph in<br>  his last weekly with a line from Campbell’s Hohenlinden—<br></p><p>
  \ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “THE COMBAT<br>
  \ THICKENS—ON YE BRAVE!”<br></p><p>  He should also have quoted the next line—“Who
  rush to “glory” or the GRAVE,”<br>  that all might know to whom the battle cry was
  addressed.<br></p>"
