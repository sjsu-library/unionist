  only remnant of war which now remains among civilized<br>  nations, was getting
  to look more favorable for Pedro.<br></p><p>  LONDON, June 14<br>  <sup>th</sup>  .—In
  the House of Commons last night, Mr C. Grant, in a speech of great<br>  length,
  laid before the House, the propositions of Government for regulating<br>  the affairs
  of the East India Company, to the effect that the trade to China<br>  should be
  thrown open; and that it is expedience the Government of India<br>  should remain
  in the hands of the Company subject to regulations to be<br>  prescribed by Parliament.<br></p><p>  LONDON,
  June 12.—The House last night resolved itself into a Committee on<br>  Colonial
  Slavery, when the resolution empowering Ministers to grant 20,000,000<br>  <em>l.</em>  as
  compensation to the West India Planters came under consideration.<br></p><p>The
  resolution was adopted 286 to 77.</p><p>  It was said that a Spanish army, to cooperate
  with that of Don Miguel, had<br>  been ordered to be collected on the frontiers
  of Portugal.<br></p><p align="center">PORTUGAL.</p><p>  OFORTO, June 4.—On Saturday
  night and Sunday morning, the 1<br>  <sup>st</sup>  and 2d inst. the first division
  of the much talked of squadron of steamers<br>  arrived off the bar, with reinforcements
  of troops, money, provisions and<br>  stores. This seasonable addition to the forces
  previously collected here has<br>  infused fresh vigor into the Constitutional party.
  Among the passengers<br>  brought by these four steamers were the Duke of Fayal
  (better known by nis<br>  former title of Marquis de Palmella,) Captain Napier,
  R.N. (the successor of<br>  Admiral Sartorius,) and others.<br></p><p>  The Pedroite
  batteries have completely silenced the Gaya by well directed shot<br>  and shells,
  exploding in its embrasures, and blowing into the air, gun<br>  carriages, bodies,
  &amp;c., till the soldiers have actually refused doing duty<br>  in this slaughterhouse,
  as they call it, from whence they are said to remove<br>  the long guns.<br></p><p>  Admiral
  Sartorius retires from the service on account of ill health, and<br>  Captain Napier
  is to assume the command of the fleet. The latter is<br>  represented to be a very
  smart and efficient officer.<br></p><p align="center">TURKEY AND RUSSIA.</p><p><em>Extract
  of a letter from Constantinople, dated May 22</em></p><p>  ‘We are very glad to
  observe that Government is sending reinforcements into<br>  the Mediterranean. It
  is high time they take some steps, or they will be too<br>  late. Russia has got
  the start of England and France, and notwithstanding the<br>  continued assurances
  given us that peace is made with Egypt, yet Russia<br>  continues pouring troops
  in here as fast as her means of transport from Odessa<br>  will permit; fresh troops
  are daily arriving. They are not, however, landed on<br>  the Bosphorus, but a few
  miles to the eastward of the entrance. By this means<br>  they mask their numbers.
  One or two of the castles at the entrance have been<br>  given up to them, and they
  are strengthening themselves as fast as they can;<br>  they have also a number of
  engineers and men working at the Dardanelles. What<br>  all this may end in we cannot
  say; appearances are any thing but favorable for<br>  a continuation of peace. The
  Ottoman Government, we fear, must fall.”<br></p><p align="center">FROM FRANCE.</p><p>  FRANCE
  AND THE UNITED STATES.—On the 11<br>  <sup>th</sup>  of June the Chamber of Deputies
  received a communication from the Ministers of<br>  Finance, who offered a bill
  opening a credit for above five millions of<br>  francs, for the payment of the
  first fifth part of the 25 millions owing the<br>  United States, according to treaty.<br></p><p
  align="center">TEN DAYS LATER</p><p>  By the packet ship Roscoe, Captain Rogers,
  we have English papers to June 25<br>  <sup>th</sup>  . By the packet ship Rhone,
  we have French papers to June 18<br>  <sup>th</sup>  .<br></p><p>  The bill for
  the abolition of West India Slavery has passed the House of<br>  Commons and been
  sent to the Lords.<br></p><p>  CONSTANTINOPLE, May 28.—(By Express.) Ibrahim Pacha
  has really commenced his<br>  retreat, and preparations are making in the Russian
  camp, which indicate the<br>  speedy withdrawal of the troops.<br></p><p>  ENGLAND.—Mr
  Elliot Cresson<br>  <em>has declined</em>  the challenge of Mr. Garrison to a public
  discussion in London on the merits<br>  of the American Colonization society.<br></p><p>  The
  advices from Warsaw state that the feeling against the Russians was daily<br>  becoming
  more violent. Several Russian officers had been killed in the<br>  streets, and
  Gen Paskewitsch himself narrowly escaped. Another revolt was<br>  contemplated.<br></p><p>  Port
  Lamar or Cobija, in Bolivia, has been declared a free port. Vessels are<br>  permitted
  to anchor and remain during pleasure, without charge of any kind.<br>  Goods which
  are landed have to pay a duty of five per cent. and some other<br>  small rates
  on being carried to the interior.<br></p>
Scholarly Notes: 
Commentary: A few items of interest – seems to be a mild pacifism through here; notices
  of<br>West Indian abolition, and concerning Garrison in London. <br>
