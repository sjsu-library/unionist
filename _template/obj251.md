transcription: "<em>Massachusetts.</em>â€”The delegation in Congress from that State
  is now full. The 8<sup>th</sup>trial to elect a member from the 9<sup>th</sup>District
  on Monday the 3d inst. resulted in the choice of Wm. Jackson, theAntimasonic candidate,
  by a majority of between 90 and 100 over Dearborn andThurber, the candidates of
  the National Republican and Jackson parties. Mr.Jackson is a sound, sensible, upright
  man, and endowed with those qualities ofhead and heart which fit him to discharge
  the duties of his office honorably tohimself and beneficially to the country. He
  is decidedly opposed to the presentadministration, and will stand shoulder to shoulder
  with Adams and Ellsworth andthe other good men and true of the New-England delegation,
  in contending for thebest interests of the country."
