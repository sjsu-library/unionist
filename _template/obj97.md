transcription: "<p>  We feel it our duty to make the fact public, that one of the
  jury refused to  listen to any remonstrance from his brother jurors, because the
  ‘law,’ the  constitutionality of which, he was called on to decide, was ‘Judson’s
  Law!!’—  <em>Advertiser.</em></p><p>  “We feel it  <em>our</em>  duty” to say in
  reference to the above, that we have conversed with one of the  jurors, who informs
  us that he heard nothing said about the law, being  ‘Judson’s law,’ or the “black
  law,” or the “Canterbury Law,” and that no  disinclination was manifested to hear
  remonstrance or to listen to reason, and  no disposition to take into consideration
  in making up the decision, anything  but the law and the constitution, and the facts
  proved, unless the exception  be found in an attempt of one juror to make the bad
  tendency of an acquittal,  an argument for conviction. And “we feel it our duty”
  too, to remind the  Advertiser of the reproofs he has, not many months since bestowed
  upon the  Fall River Monitor for not quietly acquiescing in the result of a fair
  trial  by a jury of the country. Oh! the beauty of consistency!</p>"
