transcription: "<p>  We have heard complaints made relative to the National Anti-Slavery
  Convention  that their sitting was with closed doors.&nbsp; This assertion has been
  \ repeatedly made in our presence, with apparent exultation in the belief that  the
  statement would injure the cause—and though we do not love to goad the  already
  desperate, truth compels us to assert, that the charge is utterly  false. The convention
  did NOT sit, during any portion of their session, with  closed doors. We make this
  assertion fearlessly—for our informant is one whose  veracity is unquestionable—JOHN
  G. WHITTIER, who was himself Secretary of the  convention.</p><p>  We have no doubt
  but the formation of the National Society will madden the  foes of liberty, and
  drive them to the more frequent use of their old weapons,  vituperation and falsehood,
  but the cause of truth and justice is onward,  onward, and its progress cannot be
  staid. Check the flow of the ocean-tide,  fetter the leaping lightning, hold back
  the sun from his course of strength,  but seek not to impede the march of Emancipation.</p><p></p>"
