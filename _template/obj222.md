transcription: <p align="center">THE PEOPLE’S MAGAZINE</p><p>  THIS work is published
  twice a month, &amp; is furnished to subscribers at $1  a year. It contains a large
  mass of information, and is designed as an amusing  and instructive miscellany for
  families. Each number is illustrated by a  number of beautiful engravings on wood,
  illustrative of some object of  interest, some incident in history, or some scene
  described in the work. The  publishers have the satisfaction to state that the number
  of subscribers is  now about 15,000; and while about 200 journals in the United
  States have  expressed their approbation of it, we know of no instance in which
  an  unfavorable opinion has been expressed.</p><p>  We state these circumstances,
  in the hope of extending the interest in a work,  which is calculated to be of extensive
  utility. It is among the cheapest  periodicals of the United States.</p><p>  The
  price of this Magazine is one dollar a year—six copies for $5—20 copies  for fifteen
  dollars—or twenty-five quarterly parts for five dollars. Payment  in all cases to
  be made in advance.</p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Nov.  27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  18</p><p></p>
