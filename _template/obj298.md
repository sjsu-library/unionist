transcription: "<p>  t requires but little foresight or political discernment, to
  know what the  Democratic party in this State, will have to encounter, in the shape
  of a foe,  at the coming election. Thus far, the enemy has been sly in his movements,
  and  silent in his plans. But all this is only to give the more power and effect
  to  his attack, when it is made.</p><p>  In various parts of the State, steps have
  already been taken by our opponents,  which cannot be misunderstood. The spirit
  of hostility is beginning to  manifest itself, and if the signs of the times do
  not deceive us, the votaries  of Democracy, have much to do to render permanent
  their glorious emancipation  from the galling chains of federalism. There is no
  danger, if our friends will  make a proper use of their strength.</p><p>  In this
  county, we are stronger than we were last spring; and what is still  more cheering,
  we have the influence of the Unionist against us!</p>"
