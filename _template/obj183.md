transcription: <p align="center">Parley’s Magazine</p><p>  The work was originally
  undertaken as an experiment to ascertain how far the<br>  public would encourage
  a magazine exclusively devoted to one object, viz. the<br>  intellectual instruction
  and moral improvement of the rising generation. In<br>  order to render the work
  extensively useful, a large circulation was<br>  necessary, and to ensure this,
  a very low price was indispensable.<br></p><p>  Every effort has been made to combine
  all these points in the Magazine, and we<br>  are happy to say that the success
  of our experiment thus far, is very<br>  encouraging. The circulation at present
  is nearly 15,000; a number entirely<br>  beyond that of any similar work ever undertaken
  in this country. But great as<br>  it is, such are the accumulated expenses of the
  publication, from the number<br>  of engravings, and from the care attending it,
  together with the very low<br>  price at which it is afforded, that we need a still
  more extended circulation<br>  to enable us fully to develope [sic] our plan, and
  bring into activity all the<br>  means of rendering the work still more efficient
  and useful.<br></p><p>  The idea of a state of society in which there shall not
  be an individual,<br>  either so ignorant, or so depraved, through the faults of
  education, as to be<br>  blind to his interests, and resist the great end of life,
  is perhaps a mere<br>  chimera, but if it is a point that cannot be reached, it
  may certainly be<br>  approached. But how is this to be done? By an union of heart
  and hand, among<br>  the good and wise, in giving the fullest possible activity
  and energy, to<br>  every instrument which leads to the desired end.<br></p><p>  Now,
  if in your opinion, this work is such an instrument, we suggest, as a<br>  means
  by which you may promote its usefulness, some further recommendation of<br>  it
  to the public attention, and in particular to that of teachers of<br>  [indecipherable
  – students? scholars?] and heads of families. The Work is<br>  issued every other
  week, or in quarterly Parts bound in strong cloth hacks [??<br>  On last word]<br></p><p>  The
  price is one dollar a year—six copies will be sent to any one address for<br>  five
  dollars, or ten copies for eight dollars, as we are willing (that every<br>  family
  may be accommodated) to receive twenty-five subscribers for five.<br>  Dollars paid
  quarterly, remitted in advance to the publishers.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  LILLY,<br>  WAIT, &amp; CO.<br></p><p>  Boston, Mass.
