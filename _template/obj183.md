transcription: <p align="center">Parley’s Magazine</p><p>  The work was originally
  undertaken as an experiment to ascertain how far the  public would encourage a magazine
  exclusively devoted to one object, viz. the  intellectual instruction and moral
  improvement of the rising generation. In  order to render the work extensively useful,
  a large circulation was  necessary, and to ensure this, a very low price was indispensable.</p><p>  Every
  effort has been made to combine all these points in the Magazine, and we  are happy
  to say that the success of our experiment thus far, is very  encouraging. The circulation
  at present is nearly 15,000; a number entirely  beyond that of any similar work
  ever undertaken in this country. But great as  it is, such are the accumulated expenses
  of the publication, from the number  of engravings, and from the care attending
  it, together with the very low  price at which it is afforded, that we need a still
  more extended circulation  to enable us fully to develope [sic] our plan, and bring
  into activity all the  means of rendering the work still more efficient and useful.</p><p>  The
  idea of a state of society in which there shall not be an individual,  either so
  ignorant, or so depraved, through the faults of education, as to be  blind to his
  interests, and resist the great end of life, is perhaps a mere  chimera, but if
  it is a point that cannot be reached, it may certainly be  approached. But how is
  this to be done? By an union of heart and hand, among  the good and wise, in giving
  the fullest possible activity and energy, to  every instrument which leads to the
  desired end.</p><p>  Now, if in your opinion, this work is such an instrument, we
  suggest, as a  means by which you may promote its usefulness, some further recommendation
  of  it to the public attention, and in particular to that of teachers of  [indecipherable
  – students? scholars?] and heads of families. The Work is  issued every other week,
  or in quarterly Parts bound in strong cloth hacks [??  On last word]</p><p>  The
  price is one dollar a year—six copies will be sent to any one address for  five
  dollars, or ten copies for eight dollars, as we are willing (that every  family
  may be accommodated) to receive twenty-five subscribers for five.  Dollars paid
  quarterly, remitted in advance to the publishers.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
