transcription: "“We see it stated in the “Unionist,” a paper published at Brooklyn,
  Ct., that amemorial is in a circulation in the eastern part of the State, the object
  ofwhich is, ‘the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia.’ Personsfrequently
  put their names to papers of this description without sufficientreflection, and
  on the exparte statement of those who are interested, or have anobject in procuring
  signatures. Our object in penning this notice is to cautionthe public against the
  movements of the fanatics, and to request everyintelligent man to consider well
  what he is about before signing this memorial.It as a scheme fraught with dangerous
  and alarming consequences—a project thatcannot be executed—and the very attempt
  to effect it, threatens the tranquilityof the Union. We regard these movements of
  the northern agitators, in asinfamous a light as those of the southern nullifiers,
  and they should meet withuniversal condemnation. It has been intimated that some
  of our members ofCongress would countenance this insane project: but we do not believe
  that themadness of party desperation will carry any one of them so far. Let no man
  signthis memorial who loves his country and would preserve the Union.”"
Scholarly Notes: Guessing at the date in Windham paper of 1833-11-20, and the issue
  number of The Unionist here
Commentary: The notice about this petition could have appeared in late October or
  early<br>November 1833 in the<br><em>Unionist.</em><br>Resolutions to end slavery
  in the District of Columbia were part of the New-England Anti-Slavery<br>meeting
  in January 1833, and the American Anti-Slavery organizational meeting in<br>December
  1833. Samuel J May introduced the resolution, which was seconded by Crandall lawyer
  William Ellsworth in the December meeting. So a local campaign in eastern Connecticut,
  spearheaded by the Unionist, makes sense.<br>
