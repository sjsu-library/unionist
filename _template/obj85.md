transcription: "<p>  How little do we appreciate a motherâ€™s tenderness while living!
  How heedless  we are in youth of all her anxieties and kindness. But when she is
  dead and  gone; when the cares and coldness of the world come withering to our hearts;
  \ when we find how hard it is to find true sympathy, how few love us for  ourselves,
  how few will befriend us in our misfortunes; then it is we think of  the mother
  we have lost.</p><p></p>"
Scholarly Notes: 
Commentary: While it would be easy to dismiss this as pious filler, it is a fact that
  Charles C. Burleigh ensured that his mother Lydia Bradford Burleigh would have a
  full obituary in <em>The Liberator</em>.
