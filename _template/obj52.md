transcription: "<em>Black Laws.—</em>The Charleston Mercury says, that South Carolina
  has a law identical with that<br>recently passed in Connecticut, relating to instructing
  colored children, and<br>censures the authorities for its non-execution. It seems,
  therefore, that the<br>law savors too much of barbarism, to be enforced, even in
  the slave holding<br>State of South Carolina.”<br><em>N.E. Review</em>"
