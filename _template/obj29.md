transcription: The Unionist will be taken, (says our neighbor,) by all the ladies
  in the county. We hail the omen with joy. The patronage of the ladies we should
  value highly, both from the exalted opinions we entertain of the correctness of
  their taste and judgement, and from a knowledge of the great influence they exert.
  “Woman is strongest,” said (and proved) the young Israelite to Darius, “but above
  all things Truth beareth away the victory.” Having both on our side what have we
  to fear.
