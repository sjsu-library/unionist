    "transcription": "<p><em>From the (Brooklyn) Unionist, August 29</em></p><p>  The last Advertiser declares that the story of the exclusion of Miss<br>  Crandall’s scholars from the meeting house “is wholly false.” We expressed<br>  surprise at a declaration so unqualified, and whether we had not some cause to<br>  do so, we leave our readers to decide, after they have read the following<br>  correspondence and the statement subjoined to it.<br></p><p>  We say nothing of the feelings which must have dictated such a course, except<br>  that we envy not their possessor. We wish merely to put on&nbsp; record the<br>  simple fact, that Miss Crandall’s pupils cannot attend public worship on the<br>  sabbath, in the only church within three miles of Miss C’s residence, without<br>  being called in question for so doing,—nay more—that they are virtually<br>  excluded from that place of worship, though some of them it is said are<br>  members of the church which regularly assembles there for public worship. And<br>  this is a land professedly Christian, in a State which boasts of its<br>  benevolent efforts to diffuse the blessings of the gospel among the distant<br>  heathen.”<br></p><p align=\"center\">——</p><p align=\"center\">To Miss PRUDENCE CRANDALL.</p><p>  When the committee visited you last February, stating their objections to your<br>  school, they understood from you, by your voluntary suggestion, that you<br>  should never desire, and never would put your coloured scholars into the<br>  meeting house — that you could have preaching at your own house, either black<br>  or white, and you also added, that the citizens of Canterbury need have no<br>  anxiety on that account, they might be assured, no such request would ever be<br>  made.<br></p><p>  It appears now, that you have departed from this voluntary declaration and put<br>  your colored scholars into pews ever occupied by the white females of the<br>  parish. We ask you to inform us soon, by whose license, you have thus taken<br>  possession of that part of the meeting house.&nbsp; Canterbury July 26th 1833<br></p><p>SOLOMON PAYNE,</p><p>  ANDREW HARRIS,</p><p>ISAAC KNIGHT.</p><p>  Society Com'tee.</p> <p>(A true copy.)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; July 20, 1833.<br></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Please inform Dr. Harris to-day.</p><p align=\"center\">——</p><p align=\"right\">  <em>Canterbury, July</em>  29, 1833.<br></p><p>TO SOLOMON PAYNE, ANDREW HARRIS, and ISAAC KNIGHT,</p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp; Gentlemen—I received a letter from you on the 27<sup>th</sup>  in which you asked me to inform you soon by whose licence I have taken<br>  possession of that part of the meeting house that was occupied by my colored<br>  scholars on the sabbath previous.<br></p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp; I can inform you that the authority, whether lawful or unlawful,<br>  by which I permitted my family to enter the gallery of your church, was<br>  permission received from two of the Society’s committee, viz. Dr. Harris and<br>  Deacon Bacon.<br></p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp; On Saturday the 6<sup>th</sup>  of this month I sent a verbal request by Samuel L. Hough to the gentlemen whom<br>  I address, asking your permission to attend Divine worship with you on the<br>  sabbath. I asked Captain Hough to inform you that I would purchase seats<br>  sufficient for my scholars if agreeable to you, if not, any part or portion of<br>  the meeting house you might see fit for us to occupy, would be acceptable. Of<br>  this Mr. Hough said he informed you. Dr. Harris, in answer, said we might<br>  occupy the seat in the gallery appropriated to colored persons. Mr. Hough then<br>  remarked that the seat would not be sufficient for the scholars—Deacon Bacon<br>  then replied, that we might take the next pews until we had enough to be<br>  seated.<br></p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp; Truly I said to the Committee that visited me in February<br>  last—The scholars who come here shall not trouble you on the Sabbath, for we<br>  can have preaching, either by colored or white ministers in our own house. The<br>  committee made me no reply at the time if I am not mistaken, and I think I am<br>  not.<br></p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp; Upon mature consideration (as regular preaching here was not very<br>  readily obtained) I considered that I had done entirely wrong in depriving my<br>  scholars of the privilege of attending religious worship in this village.<br></p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp; These are my reasons for asking the privilege of entering your<br>  church; and all the licence I have received is as given above.<br></p><p align=\"center\">  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yours<br>  with respect,<br></p><p>P.

Hough, Esq. from<br>  SOLOMON PAYNE, Esq. directing her not to go into the meeting house again with<br>  her pupils. For the truth of this last statement we rely upon the declaration<br>  of Samuel L. Hough, Esq.<br></p>",
    "commentary": "Church attendance, and church membership, were valorized cultural norms. Church seating was institutionalized as a marker of white supremacy, with African-Americans most often being limited to seats in the balcony. In fact, this very issue had led to the walkout by Black leaders Richard Allen and Absalom Jones from St. George's Methodist Church in Philadelphia that launched the [northern Black independent chuch movement] (http://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/pds/maai/community/text3/allenmethodism.pdf).  Therefore this particular battle in Canterbury carried great emotional and strategic weight. For those reading about this controversy in the press - including <em>The Unionist</em> - the idea of denying the students access to attending church created an informal litmus test: spiritual equality before God (favoring the students) or preserving caste privilege in the key social institution that was the Congregational Church in Connecticut.",

But very few of the 30 or 40 scholars who were expected to commence with the term, have as yet attended — owing, probably, to the “fanaticism” which seems to have taken hold on the minds of so many of the sober citizens of that portion of the “land of steady habits;” and which vents itself in vexatious attempts at legally coercing the scholars to leave the town, and the teacher to abandon the enterprise. We have been favored by a correspondent, with the following copy of a proceeding of a town-meeting on the subject, which we publish “for the benefit of whom it may concern”</p><p>“At a town meeting legally warned and held at Canterbury on the 1st day of April, 1833, Asahel Bacon Esq. Moderator—</p><p>Voted, that a petition of the town of Canterbury, to the next general assembly, be drawn up in suitable language, deprecating the evil consequences of bringing from other towns, and other states, people of color, for any purpose, and more especially for the purposes of disseminating the principles and doctrines opposed to the benevolent colonization system, praying said assembly to pass and enact such laws, as in their wisdom will prevent the evil; and that Andrew P. Judson, William Lester, Chester Lyon, Rufus Adams, Solomon Payne, Andrew T. Harris, Asahel Bacon, George S. White, Daniel Packer and Isaac Backus, be agents to do the same.</p><p>Voted, that said agents respectfully request the inhabitants of other towns to proffer similar petitions, for the same laudable object.</p><p>The foregoing is a true copy of Record:</p><p>Examined by</p><p>Andrew Judson <em>Town Clerk</em></p><p>Fine business, truly!—<em>Perhaps</em> those who have been so much in the habit of reading homilies on constitutional law, to the “hair-brained emancipationists,” might be instructed with a peep into that instrument which binds our states together, and there read for themselves, the rights of citizens going from one state to another—<em>“for any purpose,”</em>—or in its favor,—so that they conduct morally and peaceably. But what are the “evil consequences” which are so much to be <em>“deprecated,”</em> in the petitions to the legislature of that state? And how can a “petition” be “drawn up in <em>suitable language,”</em> which “deprecates the evil consequences of bringing” people of color into that town, <em>“for any purpose”</em>—whether to gain moral or literary instruction, cultivate land, vend merchandize, or “make notions”? Garrison is completely “out Garrisoned,” in “fanaticism” and “incendiary” movements,—by a body which <em>ought</em> to have been deliberative! But we do not believe a majority of the citizens of Canterbury favor such “wild schemes,” even though backed by the declaration of a professing Christian, “that before he would see the Green polluted by a negro school, he would oppose it to the shedding of blood!”",
    "commentary": "This editorial, published two months prior to <em>The Unionist</em> even being hatched, is what alerted Samuel J. May to Charles C. Burleigh and his powerful editorial voice. It is included here as an important part of the pre-history of <em>The Unionist</em>, as well as being an outstanding example of Charles C. Burleigh's writing style at this point in his career. <em>The Genius of Temperance</em>, edited by William Goodall, was a mainstay of support to the Canterbury Female Academy. Goodall's long career in reform included a significant level of support for women's rights.",

The acts of our last legislature are a sufficient index of the character of that party which has obtained, for a brief space we hope, the ascendancy in this State. We cannot, for a moment, believe that a majority of the people of Connecticut, approve <em>all</em> the recent enactments of our Legislature, but such has been and is still the course pursued by the only press existing in this county, that many of the people are probably unapprised of the spirit and tendency of their proceedings. It is too evident to be denied, that the Advertiser is so devoted to the policy of a party, and the aggrandizement of a few party leaders, that a fair discussion of the pretensions and measures of our prominent men, cannot find admission to its columns. Hence the necessity of another organ of communication to the public, on the great interests of the state and nation, which has brought the Unionist before the public.</p><p>This paper will be pledged to no party, but will canvass the claims of all aspirants to the public favor, and all measures of public policy, on their own merits. On all the great questions upon which the mind of the community is divided, a free admission will be given to well and candidly written articles on both sides, if offered, but every thing of a scurrilous or abusive character will be excluded, come from what source it may.</p><p>The Unionist will be the advocate of temperance, virtue and sound morality, and will pursue that course which a deep conviction of the truth of the sentiment contained in its motto points out. It will also contain items of general intelligence, literary selections and the usual variety of miscellaneous matter, and no effort will be spared on the part of the editor to make it worthy of the public favor. How far his efforts will succeed, the future course of the paper will determine.</p><p>☛All who receive this number of the Unionist, and approve its plan, or are willing to patronize a work of this character, are requested to send us their names as subscribers, taking care to specify particularly, the place to which they wish their papers sent.</p><p></p>",

    "transcription": "<p align=\"center\">EXTRACT.</p><p align=\"center\"><em>From a </em>4<em><sup>th</sup></em><em> of July address.</em></p><p>What, let us consider, was the specific object of our Fathers’ labors and their sacrifices? It was, that they might secure to their posterity, if not to themselves, the rights of man, the blessings of civil and religious liberty, the prerogative of self-government. Who, when he reflects that this was their object, and how steadily they kept it in view, can hesitate to accord to them a higher praise, than is due to the founders of any other nation? It was, let us repeat, the moral character of the American Revolution, which gave it its peculiar grandeur. Do you feel any veneration, any love for Washington and his com-patriots, merely on account of the bloody battles they fought? You ought not. You should recoil with horror from scenes of blood, let the actors in them have been who they may. The heroes of our Revolution, it is true, fought bravely, desperately. But this alone would be equivocal applause. It was the purity of their intentions, their self-devotion to the cause of Liberty, which makes them deservedly the pride of our country, and the honor of our race. The battles which they fought, the thousands of fellow-beings whom they slew, were incidents in the prosecution of their undertaking, which the benevolent can never think of, but with sorrow and loathing.</p><p>It is then, we say again, the great moral purpose of the Revolution, which commends it, and those who conducted it, to our most grateful remembrance. How ardent and unfeigned they were in their love of Liberty, is evident not more in what they did and suffered during the contest, than in the provisions they afterwards made for the protection of our rights.— Ere they had laid aside their arms, all fresh from the scenes of danger and of loss through which they had passed, our fathers instituted a form of government, which excluded themselves no less than it excluded others from all distinctions of honor or profit, but such as their fellow citizens might freely accord to them. The principles on which they based our civil fabric are broad and deep. Their recognition of these as the only just foundation of human governments, gives us the clearest evidence that they were men of high intellectual power, and of unparalleled integrity. They promulgated doctrines, the truth and value of which are not yet fully realized. Hereafter, their wisdom and foresight will be more justly, that is to say, more highly appreciated. — Certain momentous questions are now agitating our Republic, and others are soon coming up to trouble us, which might at once be settled by a candid appeal to the constitution which they bequeathed us. —If we guide our political and religious affairs by the plain principles therein propounded, we shall avert those evils, which now threaten our very existence as a united people. But if we disregard them, the most fearful consequences are inevitable.</p><p>Our fathers declared that all men are created equal, with a right to freedom — A declaration of infinite import! A glorious, gospel, heaven inspired truth! If we deeply feel and duly regard this, whose rights or feelings shall we violate? This is a truth which ought to be indelibly engraven on every heart. It should control all the measures of government, and the deportment of individuals towards each other. It is <em>the</em> truth, out of which arise those principles, that should guide the intercourse of man with man, and of one community with another, both in respect to their civil and their religious concerns. It is but a new version of our Saviour’s golden rule.</p><p>By the result of those measures, which were determined upon fifty-seven years ago, we have been called unto liberty. Let us seriously reflect upon the nature and extent of the blessing, that we may not use it for an occasion to the flesh, but in willing obedience to God and his Christ, whose service alone is perfect freedom.</p><p>Think not, brethren, that ye are free because your fathers threw of the yoke of colonial subjection. Think not that ye are free because ye have no king, nor hereditary nobility to reign over you. Think not that ye are free because ye live in a country where the supreme power is in the hands of the people. Such are indeed the highly favorable circumstances of your condition; and yet you may be in bondage, more abject than that from which our fathers were delivered. You may be in bondage to the majority, whose will, if the principles of our constitution be forgotten, may become as absolute and arbitrary as the will of any despot. You may be the creatures of your own party or sect, to whose opinions you may be compelled to assent, and in whose projects you may be obliged to toil, on pain of expulsion from their ranks, and the odium of an outcast. Or worse than all, you may be the slaves of some prevailing vice, or of some wicked or foolish custom.</p><p>It was obviously the intention of those who framed our constitution, to sustain every man in forming his own opinions on all subjects, and in acting in accordance with his own opinions, unless they would lead him to violate the equal rights of another. But there are indications every where, that this wise intention of our fathers has already come to be often disregarded. Unmindful of their high individual responsibility, the mass of our people, instead of examining and judging for themselves, seem willing that others should shape their opinions and guide their actions. Though they loudly boast of their freedom, they are the humble servants of “the few.” In consequence, they have become arrayed in parties and sects, the country over, with their general and subordinate leaders, and their organs of inter-communication. What their leaders declare to them, they believe too often, it is feared, without inquiry. Whithersoever their leaders go, they follow, nothing doubting. This is, we believe, too just an account of our religious and political affairs. It is rarely, very rarely, that we see an individual thinking and acting without an undue defence to some party. — How continually do we perceive in large bodies of men, a sameness of opinion and a unity of action, which there could not, would not be, if it were not for some <em>master</em> minds controlling them with absolute authority. Ye have witnessed the struggles of the rival factions in our land. Have ye thought their zeal has been according to knowledge? Have ye seen reason to believe that the individuals, on either side, thoroughly understood the merits of their cause? And that each one acted as his own best judgment and kind feelings dictated? Has it not rather been apparent to you that the individual merged himself in his party, feeling it safe for him to act in concert with numbers; and fearing, that if he should dare to stand alone, withholding himself from both sides, he might be considered trust-worthy by neither, and perhaps would incur some more distinct expression of their displeasure? Do we then exercise and enjoy, as we might and ought to do, that civil and religious liberty of which we are so boastful?</p><p>These are a few of many questions, which should be pressed upon the serious consideration of every one. Our limits forbid us to mention several others, which have been suggested to our minds by the return of this season. We wish to see the anniversary of our independence devoted to higher purposes, than it has usually been. There has been enough, and more than enough of self-gratulation. We have taken too much credit to ourselves for the deeds of our fathers. Let us do them and ourselves a higher honor. Let us emulate their excellences and shun their errors.—Indeed let us not be satisfied until we surpass them in knowledge and in virtue; as the superior advantages they procured for us should enable us to do. Let us make a wider and a higher application, than they did, of the great principles for which they so nobly contended. Let us not rest satisfied with our liberty, while aught of slavery abides in our land.</p>",

    "source": "The Unionist",
    "subject": "Allied Reform Movements - general",
    "transcription": "<p align=\"center\">THE SPIRIT OF REFORM.</p><p>What is the spirit of reform? What is it that has animated and enabled men from time to time to become reformers, not disturbers, but true reformers; and not religious reformers alone, but moral reformers of all descriptions? Has it not been a sense of independence and personal responsibleness, and of superiority to what are usually termed existing circumstances and the spirit of the age?</p><p>A very large proportion of the evil which has always existed in society, may be traced to the want of personal independence, and disregard of personal responsibility. We do not mean by independence that fiery essence of pride and selfishness, which is quick to resent a slight or wrong; which is always ready to meet aggression more than half way; and which delights to show itself in rudeness or haughtiness, as its condition may happen to be low or high. For such independence we have little sympathy and less respect, and so far from thinking that there is a want of it in the world, can only lament that there is such a superfluity. By independence we mean another and a far different thing.—We mean the resolution which adopts, and maintains, and obeys its own standard of right and wrong; which refuses to render an unquestioning homage to the voice of the many; which, being based upon principle, is not to be driven to and fro by the popular breath, even should that breath rise into a whirlwind; which acknowledging allegiance to a higher than any mortal authority, will not forfeit it at the behest of any. This is the independence which leaves to a man his own views and convictions, his own conscience, and his own conduct. Without inciting or suffering him to be forward or boisterous, it makes him steadfast and sure. Without obliging him to feel an uncharitable scorn of public opinion, it offers a rule to his admiration and observance which is alone worthy of serious study, and entitled to his faithful submission,—the great rule of right, the solemn law of God. It teaches him to consider himself as responsible for his thoughts and actions, in the first and highest place, not to the multitude, but to his Maker; and in the second place, not to the multitude, but to his own soul. It leads him into a safer, happier, and more glorious path, than the broad, dusty, soiled and soiling road, which is beaten by the multitudinous and crowding world. It sets his feet and his heart at liberty, and breathes into his soul the consciousness of individual existence and value, and the sense of individual duty.</p><p>This is the independence, to the want of which may be traced and referred very much of past and existing evil. Not possessing it, men lose themselves, their accountability, their dignity, all that constitutes them men, in the absorbing mass; where they acquire the color, and motions, and tendencies of the mighty vortex which has engulphed them. Instead of uttering a voice of their own, they wait for an acclamation, and then they join in; instead of having opinions of their own, they listen for the prevalent opinions, and then they repeat them; instead of having a morality of their own, a religion of their own, they are content to be just as moral and just as immoral, just as religious and just as irreligious, as other people; taking the tone of the world around them, which is seldom the highest, and imbibing its sentiments, which are not always the purest. They do not test and try opinions by any self-instituted process. They do not examine manners and actions according to a fixed and exalted standard. They trouble themselves with nothing of the kind. They fall in with the great procession, without inquiring whither it is going, upwards or downwards, to a good end or a bad one; it is enough for them that they are going with it. Thus it comes that so many think evil is metamorphosed into good, when they see the multitude practise it, and good is turned into evil, when they see the multitude slight, or forsake, or forbid it. And thus it comes, that the amount of evil is so vastly increased, because there are so many who blindly and carelessly, or cowardly, without using their own eyes to observe, or their own minds to prove, follow the multitude to do it.</p><p>But must we be singular? Must we be eccentric? Must we do nothing that others do; say nothing that others say?—Must we be perpetually quarrelling with society about its usages and habits? No. We are to do none of these things. It is best that we should follow the many in all ways which are indifferent; perhaps it is best that we should follow them in some ways which are inconvenient; but we must not follow them to do evil. “Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil.” That is the simple commandment. It is very true that singularity and eccentricity, when they come from a causeless, wilful, diseased principle of opposition to general custom and sentiment, are no virtues; but even then they partake no more of the nature of sin, than does a servile acquiescence in general custom and sentiment.—Without doubt, public opinion, on most points, is worthy of respectful attention and examination; but, after you have examined it by the great and permanent light within, after you have weighed it in the balance of truth and the gospel, and found it false and wanting, reject and oppose it, and if your decision is to be called singularity and eccentricity, let it be called so, and, in the name of all that is true and holy, be singular and eccentric. We are not required to dispute with the world step by step; we are not required to be solitary and to forsake the world; we are rather called upon to do all the good we can in it, and receive all the good we can from it. But we are required to recognize a higher authority than the world’s will; to obey a more sacred commandment than the world’s law. We are required to form moral and religious principles of our own, and to regulate our commerce with the world. If we will not do this, we shall do evil; for we shall do whatever the multitude does, and the multitude often does evil. The reason why so many follow a multitude to do evil, is, that they want moral independence, and do not hold themselves individually accountable to their own spirit, or to the Father of Spirits.</p>",

    "transcription": "<p align=\"center\">POPULAR EDUCATION,</p><p align=\"center\">POLITICALLY CONSIDERED.</p><p>Allowing what we are so continually boasting about, that more information is universally diffused among us than among any people on earth, and that all are at liberty to acquire knowledge to any extent, still it cannot be denied, that there is prevalent a great deal of ignorance on many subjects of paramount importance. It is nothing to the purpose—it is no consolation whatever to insist, that still we are superior in this respect to other communities. The only question for us to consider is—whether the people of this country have as much knowledge, as is indispensable to their temporal and eternal well-being—their social or individual happiness? Whether there is no need of earnestly reiterating every where among then the exhortation of the wise man “get wisdom, get understanding?”</p><p>I am well aware that much is <em>said</em> about the necessity of a general diffusion of knowledge to the preservation of our political constitution. But in respect to this point alone, I question if there be common among us a clear perception, and deep feeling of its importance. Else why is it that in many of our States scarcely any provision, and in some none whatever, is made for the instruction of youth; and that even in those States, which have long been applauded for the great number of their schools, a large proportion of these have ever been and still are inadequate to the purpose for which they were instituted. Though we have in New England much of the form of public education, the reality is generally wanting. Very few, in comparison with the whole number of those who attend our common schools, very few leave them possessed of those elements of good learning, which it is pretended are taught there. Very few indeed who can write their thoughts on any subject with propriety and ease; and not many more who can read the thoughts of others with facility and pleasure. Most that is really acquired at these schools, even by those who make the best use of the advantages afforded in them, is a sort of verbal acquaintance with three or four elementary sciences. They do not acquire there the use of the higher powers of mind—thinking, reasoning, judging—and our youth, excepting in the few instances of those who receive good instruction at home, go forth into the world, mingle in the collisions, and assume more or fewer of the offices of society without knowing how to distinguish between many things that differ essentially. They at once fall into the ranks of this party or that, and are content to swell the number of those, who cry out for one popular leader or another—for this system of measures or that.</p><p>Although we often hear it said, an every body concurs in the sentiment, that a federal republic cannot long&nbsp; be maintained unless the people generally are well informed, yet I ask what school, yes what single school can be named, where the great principles of civil government t are taught, and the peculiar characteristics of our Federal constitution. These, like all other great principles, are simple, and not hard to be understood, unless, the mind has been warped by a regard to sectional interests, or the schemes of a faction.—What young man of common sense might not easily be made, even before he leaves school, to understand these things perfectly? And if all young men were, as they should be, thus taught, moreover made to realize deeply their individual responsibilities as freemen, how difficult would it be to make them the creatures of a party, and to impose upon them as is continually done by factious men. But instead of this, how true it is, and sad as it is true, that most of our young men are left to learn all they are to know of political science, and of their own duties as members of a great Republic, amidst the contests of rival factions, and from those whose opinions have been warped by sectional interests and party passions.</p><p>Let it not be said, that I would impose upon the private citizen a degree of knowledge, which it can be needful only for pubic functionaries, or men of great influence in the community to possess. Let it not be objected, that I am urging the example even of a king upon every one, who hears me. Let it not be urged, that Solomon had a need of great wisdom which any of us have not; and that it is not worthwhile for all our young men to seek knowledge with as much ardor as he did, because only a few can rise to places of important trust. I say let not such sentiments be uttered, especially in this country. For is not the doctrine of hereditary right to rank utterly denounced among us? Are we not <em>all</em> born kings and princes as much as any one? Does not the supreme power emanate from ourselves? Are not <em>the people</em> the sovereign of the land?—Whom they will, they set up, and whom they will, they put down. And surely no one can foretell, which of our youth will hereafter be chosen by their fellow citizens to offices, the duties of which nothing less than the wisdom and understanding of Solomon would qualify them to discharge well.</p><p>As every man in the course of events may be called upon to serve the public, every man should qualify himself to do so in the best manner possible. But suppose that ninety out of a hundred of our youth may never be placed in office, be it remembered they are all to take a part in conferring offices; and this, though unhappily it is lightly esteemed, is a duty no less than a privilege of greatest moment. He is not fit to be a freeman, who does not hold his right of suffrage most sacred; too sacred to be prostituted to a party, not less than to the will of an individual usurper! He is not fit to have the right of suffrage, who does not hold his high prerogative in such esteem, that he will not exercise it but upon independent and rational conviction! And such a conviction cannot be formed in a mind that is unenlightened. Can any one deny that the more wisdom an individual may have, the more valuable he will be to the country, though he may never be known in public life?—If all our private citizens were as wise as Solomon, would it not be all the better for themselves and for the nation? Surely so! else are the fundamental principles of our civil constitution false!!</p>",

On this signal occasion, the city decreed a public expression of their gratitude to the negroes, in a sort of triumph, and at the same time awarded the freedom of eighty of their leaders. One of them having shown his claims to the boon, declared that to obtain his freedom had all his life formed the proud object of his wishes; his claim was indisputable; yet now however, to the amazement of the judges, he refused his proffered freedom! The reason he alleged was a singular refinement of heartfelt sensibility: ‘My kind mistress,’ said the negro, ‘once wealthy, has fallen into misfortunes in her infirm old age. I work to maintain her, and at intervals of leisure she leans on my arm to take the evening air. I will not be tempted to abandon her; and I renounce the hope of freedom that she may know she possesses a slave who will never quit her side.</p>",

    "source": "The Unionist",
    "subject": "Journalistic Debate",
    "transcription": "<p align=\"center\">THE UNIONIST.</p> <br><p align=\"center\">BROOKLYN, AUGUST 8, 1833.</p><p>The Advertiser has taken us to task quite severely, for what, with his moral accuracy, he calls our “false pretences” or “gross inconsistency.” The irresistible reasoning, by which he arrives at a conclusion so unfavorable to us, deserves a passing notice. After quoting from our prospectus, a sentence showing our disapprobation of the dominant party in our last Legislature, he goes on with the confident air of a man who thinks he cannot be mistaken, “what is this but an acknowledged preference for, and a devotion to a political party?” How conclusive! Because we disapprove one political party, we must necessarily—not merely approve, but be <em>devoted</em> to another. Because we have expressed a hope that one party will not reign long, “it follows” that we shall endeavor to transfer the rule to another. Admirable logic!</p><p>To the Advertiser’s assertion that the paper originated in party feeling and from unworthy motives, we answer, (first asking by the way, who probably knows our motives best, we or the Advertiser,) that it matters little to what motives the establishment of the Unionist is attributable, so long as its <em>course</em> is fair, upright and consistent with its professions. If the Advertiser will pursue such a course, we will promise to say nothing about the motives which induced its change from the “bitter hostility to President Jackson and his friends” which it manifested “for nearly five years,” to a course and character diametrically opposite. We will not even hint that the <em>disinterested</em> Advertiser which resolves to “continue firm and unflinching in the pursuance of its duty, so long as it has one reader left,” was <em>bought up</em> by the Jackson party.</p><p>But it is said that we are not consistent with our professions. We will not take it upon us to say whether, in making this charge, the Advertiser man has exposed his incapacity to comprehend the plain import of language, or has shown a disposition, wilfully to pervert the truth. One of the two is evident. That we do not possess experience “in getting up independent papers,” headed with professions at variance with our intended practice, or in any other species of deception, which would enable us to impose upon the public and yet escape suspicion, we freely confess; nor is it our desire at present to avail ourselves of the superior experience in such matters of any of our editorial brethren. When we engage in an enterprise which requires that kind of experience, we shall doubtless call in the assistance of such of our acquaintance as are best versed in the mystery of making promises to be “revoked.” But that we are incompetent to the easy task of telling the truth, (for we consider it easy, whatever the Advertiser may think of it,) in plain, intelligible language, we are unwilling yet to admit. We refer any candid man, to our prospectus, and the leading article of our first number, for evidence that we have spoken intelligibly; and to the whole of that sheet, and of this also, for proof that, so far as we can be judged by our acts, what we said was <em>truth</em> that we have been consistent with our professions. We ask our readers to compare with the evidence thus collected, the leading article and several other pieces in the last Advertiser, and say if that paper has not misrepresented us. We have never represented ourselves as indifferent or neutral on the questions moral or political, at present agitating the community, nor are we so. We have opinions which we shall defend to the extent of our poor ability, for their defence this paper was established. In our leading article last week, we alluded to the fact that “the majority had no organ of communication,” as one reason why some gentlemen opposed in sentiment to the Advertiser, had put in operation this press, one object of which would be, to counteract the effect of the Advertiser’s unfair course. Now does not this show clearly, that in charging us as guilty of inconsistency because we oppose the measures he advocates, the Advertiser editor brings against us a groundless accusation.</p><p>But it will perhaps be said, we are pledged to no party. And so we are. Can the Advertiser see no difference between opposing his party and supporting another? Cannot this paper be made the organ of the majority, and yet be the exclusive organ of no party? If he will lay his finger on the passage in our paper in which we advocate any party as such, or in any way depart from our expressed design of canvassing the claims of men and the propriety of measures on their own merits, then will we acknowledge our offence, and humbly ask forgiveness and promise amendment, nor will we “revoke our promise” before the week’s end, even should he tell his readers we have made it.</p><p>While we thus openly declare that we are not indifferent on the subjects which have been noticed in our paper, we still adhere to our avowal, that we shall discuss them and give our opinions upon them, without reference to the circumstances that this or that party holds sentiments similar to, or differing from ours, we shall also admit properly written communications against, as well as in favor of our views. If this will not constitute our paper as independent one, we acknowledge our ignorance of the meaning of the term.</p><p>When the Advertiser detects us departing from this course, he may then complain of us, as we have done of him, for being one sided, and may call ours a “counterfeit independent paper.” And when we perceive him pursuing a course like this, we will acknowledge his right to the praise of <em>genuine</em> independence. But till then we shall consider ourselves justified in adhering to our original assertion, that the <em>want of fairness and independence </em>in the Advertiser, led to the establishment at this time, of another paper.</p>",

A “certain person” calls and requests a sight of it. Oh! I have lent it, but you shall see it when it is returned. The “person” relates the transaction just as it occurred, and without note or comment. “You doubt my word” exclaims the Advertiser, “you insinuate that I never had the letter, and now <em>you</em> shan’t see it.” Who can resist the conviction that he certainly had the letter, as he said.—Now we assure the Advertiser man that we have no desire to see the document if he does not wish it.

EDITOR.—It is often said that the perpetuity of our peculiar form of government, and the preservation of our free institutions, which are in truth the chief glory of our land, depend upon the INTELLIENCE and VIRTUE of the people; this has been so often repeated and so universally assented to, that it has come to be a trite political maxim. Now suppose, or rather admit, the people of Connecticut to be an <em>intelligent people, </em>what will be one of the necessary consequences resulting from the admission? Surely that the people themselves examine the spirit and tendency of all laws which are to be enforced among them; and further that they see and know that their Representatives in the exercise of their delegated power, do not transcend the limits prescribed them by the Constitution, which is a gauge in the hand of the Constituent to be applied to acts of the delegate.</p><p>The Constitution was not made for the Executive, nor the Legislative, nor the Judicial department of the Government! For whom then was it made? The people made it, and they made it for themselves and for their posterity; it is then emphatically the people’s; and on its provisions they rely, for its support they will contend, and by its spirit and its letter shall their privileges and immunities be adjudged. It is a mighty shield, which the humblest citizen may lift up between himself and the inflictions of injury by arbitrary, assumed authority; it is a sanctuary, to which the persecuted may flee and find ample and free protection; and it is a Haven, so safe that he who <em>anchors within </em>&nbsp;it, needs no <em>insurance</em>!</p><p>Such being the Constitution, how invaluable a treasure! What should be done to preserve it? Diffuse knowledge through the land,—open the fountains of intelligence,—be as Catholic in matters of Education, as you are tolerant in religion,—be in fact, what you are in profession,—a Democracy, and let the INTELLIGENCE be, where the POWER is, in the People! Then, and not till then, will the symmetry of our inimitable form of Government shine forth in the full splendor and beauty of its exact proportions; then, and not till then, will the harsh notes of discord cease, and be succeeded by a deep and national euphony sweeping over the land, and by its magic strains charming to the standard of the Constitution, every lover of his race,—of his Country and of his God. Who that is at all competent to examine with understanding the Constitution of the U. States—to perceive its checks and balances—where power is imparted and where again, it operates with restraining force—where provisions are made for an efficient and energetic administration of the government, and in case of abuse, the <em>Cavesson</em> placed in the hands of the people—to see with a philanthropic ken, the beautiful and harmonious distributions of the functions of Government, among the various departments, and above all to perceive and realize that, with the framers of this revered instrument, the ultimate object, after all was the security and happiness o the people,—who that can do this, will not wish the Constitution of his country to remain inviolate, and be desirous that to the Constitutional test should be brought every doubtful or ambiguous enactment of State Legislatures? Although I detest all petty litigation by which the peace of community is many times disturbed, yet I most heartily rejoice when ever I see one of my fellow citizens on whom a law, novel in its provisions and doubtful in its tendency, is made to bear, pursuing “the peaceful and rightful remedy” by laying his complaint before a tribunal, constituted, among other things, to protect the citizen from all unconstitutional enactments upon his personal liberty, or his right of private property. The citizen who does this evinces a vigilance, and a respect for the great charter of our rights, commendable to himself, and worthy the emulation of others. What will be the prospect of the Republic, when such a deep and sickly apathy shall overtake our citizens, as that they can witness even with partial indifference any infractions upon the Constitution, their richest earthly treasure; and if its integrity be preserved, the best inheritance of their children, but, when crippled and polluted, their sorest calamity!</p><p>UNIONIST.</p>",

    "subject": "Education; Canterbury Female Academy",
    "transcription": "<p align=\"center\">THE QUESTION.</p><p><strong>Considerable pains are taken to keep the question respecting the Canterbury School from coming fairly before the public. The following extract from Mr. May’s letter to Andrew T. Judson, Esq. presents it in the true light.</strong></p><p>Nothing, I am confident, could have been further from Miss Crandall’s intention, than to do her neighbors any injury. And Sir, you may rest assured, the gentlemen referred to in her Advertisement would not uphold her a moment in violating any of your rights. The determination she has formed to devote herself to the education of colored females, we cannot but highly approve. Her residence in your village is altogether a providential circumstance. We should encourage her benevolent enterprise, wherever it might be undertaken. And if a suitable situation can be provided for her, in some place where her neighbors would assist and cheer her, or where they would only not molest her, we should rejoice to have her remove thither. But you declared, in the town meeting, that the school should not be located in any part of Canterbury—and also that there is not a town in the State which would admit such a seminary within its borders. It is therefore all the more necessary that she should be sustained where she now is. It is to be deeply regretted that yourself and others are opposed to her. We think you are doing yourselves no honor; and more than that, we are persuaded you are helping to perpetuate the great iniquity, and the deep disgrace of our country. The question between us is not simply whether thirty or forty colored girls shall be well educated at a school to be kept in Canterbury; but whether the people in any part of our land will recognize and generously protect the “inalienable rights of man,” without distinction of color? If this be not done, in Connecticut, where else in our land can we expect it will be done, at least in our day? That it cannot be done even in this State without a struggle, is not most shamefully obvious. A year or two since, some benevolent individuals proposed to erect an institution, at New Haven, for the education of colored young men. The design was defeated by violent opposition. If the citizens had opposed merely its location in that City, they might have escaped condemnation, for such a seminary there might have been very prejudicial to Yale College. But it was only too apparent, that their hostility to the institution was peculiarly embittered by their prejudices against the color of those, who were to be educated at it. So too in the case at Canterbury; no one pretends there would have been any opposition to Miss Crandall’s school, if her pupils were to be white. The tincture of their skin then it is which has called out the men of influence in array against her; and has even procured from the freemen of the town an expression of their “unqualified disapprobation” of her plan.</p><p>Here then, in Connecticut, we have had two recent instances of outrage committed upon “the inalienable rights of man.” Among these rights, to use the language of the Declaration of Independence “are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” Now Education has from the first, been regarded in this State highly conducive to private happiness, and the public weal. Yet have our colored brethren been twice angrily denied permission to seek this blessing, to the extent they have desired. Will the people of Connecticut generally, countenance these violation of our civil and religious principles? If they will, let them no longer claim to be a republican, much less a christian people!</p>",
    "commentary": "Samuel J. May (1797-1871) was the Unitarian minister of Brooklyn - the only Unitarian in the entire state of Connecticut at the time - and the best strategic thinker among Prudence Crandall's local white allies. Here he names the problem quite precisely: \"Education has from the first, been regarded in this State highly conducive to private happiness, and the public weal. Yet have our colored brethren been twice angrily denied permission to seek this blessing.\" The \"twice angrily denied\" refers to the New Haven Manual Labor College effort of 1831, while the second denial is the Black Law against the Canterbury Female Academy.",

We do so, because we understand it to be a sort<br>  of official declaration of the grounds upon which the law and proceedings<br>  under it, relative to the school for colored children in that town, are to be<br>  defended. We are certainly willing it should have all proper weight. Yet we<br>  must think the ground taken will be very difficult to maintain. The opposition<br>  to the school then, is made because it is a school of immediate abolition<br>  doctrines. This is not the ground of defence which has ever before been taken.<br>  The Report to the Legislature and the Law, both set forth the injurious influx<br>  of blacks from other states as the evil to be prevented. But whether new or<br>  old, the position now assumed is one which cannot be maintained under our<br>  institutions. We have learned, and our constitutions are based upon the<br>  knowledge, that the best way to put down error is by argument, not by law.<br>  That the best way to maintain truth and sound opinions is to leave error<br>  unrestrained. Admitting therefore, that the doctrines of the abolitionists are<br>  never so erroneous, it amounts to nothing in defence of the law; for error,<br>  whether religious, political, scientific, or of whatever sort, is entitled, so<br>  far as the laws are concerned, to set up schools and colleges, and propagate<br>  itself by all peaceable means, as entirely unrestrained as if it were pure<br>  truth. Surely in Connecticut, that focus of toleration, the doctrines of this<br>  defence will find no countenance. As to the improprieties in the manner of<br>  introducing the school, and the abusive anonymous letters which were sent to<br>  the gentlemen, they are certainly not matters which full grown men should set<br>  forth in so formidable a manner. Indeed we think that such a defence as this,<br>  must be with sensible men, their last effort before abandoning the cause.<br></p>",

    "transcription": "<p>Canterbury, CT. July 19, 1833</p><p align=\"center\">CIRCULAR OF MESSRS ADAMS AND JUDSON.</p><p align=\"right\">CANTERBURY, CT. July 19, 1833</p><p>  It may be due the public, as well as ourselves, and the town in which we<br>  reside, that a concise answer should be made to some of the most prominent<br>  aspersions cast upon us, and our fellow citizens, in connection with the<br>  subject of a school set up in Canterbury for “colored misses.” We had supposed<br>  that the principal facts were understood by the community, so that any<br>  exaggerated statements, false accusations, or artful insinuations, would find<br>  no resting place in the mind of any honest man. Lest it may be supposed that<br>  we acquiesce in these numerous and perverted statements, we think proper to<br>  present for consideration, a few circumstances, trusting that those who know<br>  us, will not so readily receive for truth, the assumptions of those who have<br>  so liberally bestowed so great a variety of epithets upon us.<br></p><p>  PRUDENCE CRANDALL came here with a proposition to remove her School from<br>  Plainfield to this place, and establish one here, for the instruction of Young<br>  Ladies. The citizens of Canterbury readily embraced the offer, and gave her<br>  their patronage. The School, continued from the Fall of 1831, until January or<br>  February, 1833. At that time, as we have since learned, Miss C. was proselyted<br>  to the<br>  <em>immediate Abolition</em>  faith. She started for Boston under a fictitious pretence, and saw<br>  <em>Mr. Garrison,</em>  the leader of that party. She returned home and immediately went to New York<br>  and came back, as she told us, with an engagement and under a contract, to<br>  receive into her school, twenty colored girls, with an expectation of<br>  increasing the number to the full extent of her accommodations. The dismission<br>  of her former school, and the announcement of this new project, was the first<br>  knowledge given to those who had patronized her. It was soon ascertained upon<br>  what ground the school was to be established, and what principles were to be<br>  inculcated. The levelling principles of the immediate abolitionists, had taken<br>  full possession of her mind, and it was soon made known to us,<br>  <em>who</em>  were to be the patrons of the school. When we saw Arnold Buffum, and others<br>  associated with him, assert what they denominated her rights, and when their<br>  threats were poured out upon the town, and all its inhabitants, we could<br>  anticipate the ultimate effects upon the town.<br></p><p>  We distinctly state to all who may feel an interest in this matter, that we<br>  are not opposed to the education and kind treatment of the colored people. It<br>  is not in the power of any man, in truth, to say, that we have ever<br>  ill-treated a person of color. We desire to see them free and happy. This is<br>  the universal sentiment of the inhabitants of the town, so far as we know it.<br>  Our schools admit colored children to equal privileges, and we rejoice that<br>  they do so. Those schools are all visited and are under the superintendence of<br>  proper boards, excluding all danger, from the inculcation of erroneous<br>  principles. The law now in force, makes schools for foreign blacks subject to<br>  the assent of the civil authority and select men of each town, so that it is<br>  an easy matter to have such a school now, provided that board could be<br>  satisfied that no pernicious principles are to be inculcated, and no danger<br>  could arise to the town or state. Is not this right? Why should any person<br>  desire to force upon any community, a school of any sort, against all their<br>  wishes? Have the inhabitants no right to be heard in reference to the location<br>  of such an institution among them, and more especially when they know the<br>  dangerous consequences to which such measures would tend? Are the people of<br>  this State ready to admit that the abolitionists, as they are called, are<br>  diffusing sentiments and opinions consistent with the constitution and the<br>  peace of society? Is there any individual in the State of Connecticut, who<br>  would feel willing to have such a school. Together with all the necessary<br>  evils, situated within his own town or village? The answer, will be, no. Then<br>  let the same feeling be extended to us. This is the only way to ascertain<br>  whether the town of Canterbury has done right or wrong. The distinct objection<br>  which has been made by the inhabitants of the town, to the location o this<br>  school within its limits, consists in the dangerous tendency of the principles<br>  pressed by the abolitionists wherever they go, in language peculiar to<br>  themselves.—These principles are well understood, and it would be with deep<br>  regret, that any school should be established and continued, for their<br>  advancement, in a community where our friends are compelled to reside.*<br></p><p>  The manner in which Miss C. effected the change in her school, was very<br>  objectionable, and no friend that we have met with, can furnish any<br>  justification. We know of nothing that could have been done by the town, that<br>  has not been done, to induce her to remove the school, to some place where<br>  there were no objections. She has been urged by individuals—and entreated by<br>  committees, who have waited upon her, to give up this location of her school.<br>  We have heretofore stated, and we now repeat it that we offered to take the<br>  house at the price she had contracted to pay for it, and relieve her from any<br>  loss on that account. This was declined, and then the town petitioned the<br>  General Assembly, and the law which she, with the advice of her friends, now<br>  resists, was passed. Nearly a month after the rising of the Legislature, she<br>  was notified that a suit would be commenced by the Grand Juror. At the trial,<br>  her counsel gave in a demurrer to the complaint, admitting the facts true, and<br>  submitted to the finding of the court without argument. The Court required her<br>  to give bonds of $150 to appear at the net Court, which she refused to<br>  give.—This she had a right to do, and be committed if she chose. No one will<br>  say that she could not have given the bond on the spot. But it had been agreed<br>  before hand, by those who directed her what to do, that she should go to jail.<br>  She went and staid as long as suited her purposes, less than 24 hours, and<br>  then gave the bond. Some person has put in wide circulation, the story that<br>  she was confined in the cell of Watkins the murderer. This is part of the same<br>  contrivance to “get up more excitement!” She never was confined in the<br>  “murderer’s cell.” She was lodged in the debtor’s room, where every<br>  accommodation was provided, both for her and<br>  <em>her friends,</em>  whose visits were constant. She was confined no where else. It is said in<br>  justification of this untruth, that Watkins, some of the last days of his<br>  life, was taken out of his cell to receive the clergy and his friends, in the<br>  debtor’s room, because it was more convenient. How does that accord with the<br>  statement made? Just as well might it be said by those who go into the<br>  meeting-house, where Watkins attended meeting some of his last Sabbaths, that<br>  <em>they</em>  had been in the “murderers cell.”<br></p><p>  Does any one think or believe that this school, with all its evils, should be<br>  fixed, and permanently located here, we will just ask them to consider the<br>  manner too, in which this has been pressed upon us, by foreigners or persons<br>  residing out of town and State. If they are actuated by the pure principles of<br>  benevolence, how much more of that virtue they would evince to the world, by<br>  taking the school home to the places of their own residence. What necessity is<br>  there to bring persons from New York, or Philadelphia, to Canterbury? They<br>  certainly can be educated there quite as well, and more especially if we are<br>  so much like barbarians as is pretended. We wish this to be well considered,<br>  before blame is cast upon the town of Canterbury. Is not the peace and safety<br>  of community, of consequence? It will not be understood that the town ever<br>  entertained any danger from the girls themselves, but every person must know<br>  that many others will of necessity, be drawn around this nucleus, and<br>  connected with the principles of the abolitionists, who will not say that our<br>  habitations, our persons and our peace, will be insecure? In answer to this<br>  question, we will exhibit to the public, some of the principles,—some of this<br>  christian benevolence,—some of this milk of human kindness, extended to us.<br>  During the last week, the<br>  <em>“Climax”</em>  has been circulated, and sent us from the Post office in New York, marked with<br>  double postage, when the gentleman from whose press it issued, might as well<br>  have brought it himself to us, as to others. We unequivocally say, the<br>  ”Climax” is a wanton perversion of truth.<br></p><p>  We will invite the reader to go one step further. We have received through the<br>  Post Office, from some zealous abolitionist, a tract, upon which is<br>  ingeniously written, in connection with the title of the tract, so that when<br>  taken together it reads as follows—viz:<br></p><p>“Thus saith the Lord, consider your way.</p><p>The Eternal Misery of Hell: this place is for whom?</p><p>For Judge Adams and A.T. Judson.”</p><p>  If the reader will not be wearied, one other specimen of this benevolent work,<br>  which is going on to coerce this State into these Christian measures, as they<br>  are denominated, shall also be exhibited to public view. On the 18<sup>th</sup>  inst., one of the signers of this communication had delivered to him by the<br>  Post Master, a letter mailing in Pittsburg, Penn. July 12, in the following<br>  language:<br></p><p align=\"right\">‘Pittsburg July 10, 1833.</p><p>  “Disgraceful Scoundrel—I have just read in the Boston Advocate, that you have<br>  had a white young lady put in prison, for taking in her school some colored<br>  girls. From all that I have seen and heard of your conduct in this matter, I<br>  must say my opinion of you is this—You is (are) a poor, dirty, mean, pitiful,<br>  dastardly puppy. Hypocritical villain, a rascal of the lowest order. I cannot<br>  or will not waste any more paper with such a Hell deserving hypocrite as you<br>  is. (are.) But this much I will tell you, I will be in Canterbury in 3 weeks,<br>  and you may prepare yourself for me, for I mean to beat you under the earth,<br>  if I can lay my hands on you. If not I will take a shot at you. You poor dead<br>  dog.”<br></p><p>  “N.B. If you don't change your course of life and conduct towards that good<br>  young woman, in case I do not meet with you myself, I will hire some Irishman<br>  to mould you. It<br>  <em>shall</em>  be done if I have to [pay] five hundred dollars to have it done.”<br></p><p>  “I leave you a poor Devil. G.P.”<br></p><p>  “The name of the young lady is Miss Prudence Crandall. At the advice of a<br>  friend, [I] erase my name, as I shall be in your little Hell.”<br></p><p>  Fellow citizens, such is the temper, and such the means employed, to fasten<br>  upon this town, and its inhabitants, an institution of<br>  <em>benevolence.</em>  When it shall be fastened here, what will be the effect? We leave them to the<br>  sober judgment of reflecting men.<br></p><p>RUFUS ADAMS.</p><p>ANDREW T. JUDSON.</p><p>  *The charge implied in this sentence, is a FALSE ACCUSATION.

    "transcription": "<p>TO RUFUS ADAMS, ESQ.,</p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AND ANDREW<br>  T. JUDSON, ESQ.<br></p><p>  Gentlemen: I presume that the foregoing communication contains a statement of<br>  the case, between yourselves &amp; Miss Crandall, as favorable to yourselves,<br>  as you were able to make. The request to all the Editors of newspapers in the<br>  state, that they would republish the article is proof sufficient of the<br>  estimation in which it is held. Still, gentlemen, it appears to me to be any<br>  thing but an exculpation of yourselves. This I shall now attempt to show.<br></p><p>  You evidently intend it should be believed, that Miss Crandall gave the<br>  citizens of Canterbury just cause of offence, at first, in having so soon<br>  discontinued the instruction of their daughters. The charge has indeed been<br>  explicitly brought against her in another periodical (“the Colonizationist No.<br>  2”) in a letter from Canterbury, written very probably by one or the other of<br>  yourselves. It is there stated, that she “made numerous and solemn engagements<br>  with the citizens of Canterbury, that if they would aid her in the<br>  establishment of a school, she would continue the school for their children.<br>  “These engagements” says the letter-writer “she has violated without excuse.”<br>  If you could prove all this, Gentlemen, you would certainly prove that<br>  <em>she</em>  did very wrong, but not that<br>  <em>you</em>  have done right.” I will venture to say however, that if she had given up the<br>  office of an instructress altogether, we never should have heard a<br>  syllable about her “numerous, solemn engagements.” And discontinued the<br>  instruction of your children, if she had not first been threatened with the<br>  loss of your patronage, unless she dismissed from her school a colored girl,<br>  whom she thought it her duty to educate.† Now, gentlemen, if it be true, as<br>  you assert, that you and your neighbors are not opposed to the education and<br>  kind treatment of colored people, if you really desire to see them free and<br>  happy, why was Miss C. threatened with loss of patronage if she permitted<br>  Sarah Harris to continue as one of her pupils? You tell your readers that the<br>  common schools in your town admit colored children to equal privileges with<br>  white ones, and that you rejoice that they do so. Why then did you not rejoice<br>  that Miss Crandall admitted a colored girl into her school? Why! unless you<br>  chose that the children of colored people should enjoy the blessings of<br>  education, only in a very stinted measure? Answer me this if you please?<br></p><p>  Again. You complain, and have elsewhere complained that Miss C. made the<br>  change in her school abruptly—that she did it without asking the consent or<br>  even the advice of her former patrons. I apprehend that the blame for<br>  this must attach to yourselves rather than to her. If you had ever evinced,<br>  that interest in the education and freedom and happiness of our colored<br>  brethren, which you now profess to feel, there can be little doubt that she<br>  would have disclosed to you her feelings and her purposes; and gladly have<br>  availed herself of your assistance. But she perceived that you, like most of<br>  our white brethren, regarded the colored children of our Heavenly Father as<br>  doomed to degradation, and not to be admitted to equal privileges even in this<br>  land of boasted liberty. Therefore she did not reveal her plan until it was<br>  matured. She anticipated that you would oppose it. The event has proved that<br>  she judged correctly.<br></p><p>  But you assure your fellow-citizens, and have made the declaration before,<br>  that the main ground of your opposition to the school, has been and is that<br>  you know certain erroneous principles were to be inculcated there. What those<br>  principles are, you have not stated. You<br>  <em>assert</em>  that they are very dangerous—thinking perhaps that you may thus frighten the<br>  community into the belief that your persecution of Miss Crandall has been<br>  altogether reasonable, and praiseworthy. Have not the enemies of truth, and<br>  freedom, and the Gospel in all ages pursued a similar course? Let us see how<br>  you have proceeded.<br></p><p>  Miss Crandall advertised in several newspapers, that she would receive into<br>  her family “young ladies and little misses of color” and give them instruction<br>  in certain branches of knowledge, which she specified. You and others in the<br>  village were offended at her proposal. And I venture to say that no one of you<br>  will deny that the real ground of your offence was, that her pupils were to be<br>  colored girls. If her proposals had been to receive into her family “young<br>  ladies and little misses” from New-York and Boston and other cities, whose<br>  parents would be able and willing to pay more liberally for their education,<br>  than we in the country are accustomed to pay for ours. I suppose not one of<br>  her neighbors would have dreamt of denying her the right to do so. It was then<br>  without doubt the color of her pupils, that was the whole ground of the<br>  objection made at first to her school. Instead however of frankly<br>  acknowledging this—acknowledging that you are unbelievers (practically at<br>  least) of the great truth that all men are created equal, and have an<br>  unalienable right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness—instead I say<br>  of frankly acknowledging your unbelief or your dislike of this truth, as the<br>  ground of your opposition, you have gone about (like the opposers of human<br>  improvement in all ages) to make it generally believed that the school was<br>  established for purposes very different from those avowed in the<br>  advertisement. You have tried to awaken the apprehension that the existence of<br>  such a school will be directly or indirectly most dangerous to the peace, and<br>  welfare of the country. And you now set this forth as your principal objection<br>  to the school.<br></p><p>  How should you, gentlemen, like to be dealt with in this mode? How would Col.<br>  Judson like to find his neighbors opposing his location in their village, on<br>  the presumption, that he had set up his office there, for other purposes than<br>  those of his profession—on the presumption that he came there to disseminate<br>  certain pernicious doctrines in politics or religion? How would be like it, if<br>  he found the people of Canterbury combined to make him discontinue his<br>  practice as a lawyer, or leave the town, because he is known to be a<br>  freemason. If his neighbors should succeed in diffusing unfriendly feelings<br>  towards him throughout the town, and at length procured a general meeting of<br>  the inhabitants to express their unqualified disapprobation of his purpose to<br>  continue as a lawyer among them, what would he think, what would he say, if<br>  after having heard himself accused of holding and intending to disseminate<br>  pernicious principles, his fellow citizens should refuse his permission to be<br>  heard in explanation and defence of his real views and purposes? Would he not<br>  cry out against the unrighteousness? Gentlemen, you must reverse the case, if<br>  you would see how your conduct appears to many, and will appear to many more.<br></p><p>  That some of Col. Judson’s principles are actually bad, dangerous to the peace<br>  of Society &amp;c. has now become most notorious. For has he not been laboring<br>  from the first to prevent the dissemination of what he believes to be<br>  erroneous and dangerous opinions, not by<br>  <em>showing</em>  them to be erroneous, but by exciting the popular prejudices, and calling for<br>  the interference of the civil arm? And is there any principle, which has<br>  wrought more mischief in the world that this? All history answers, No.<br></p><p>  In this connexion, I will notice a false accusation which you have again<br>  brought against me. You accuse Mr Buffum and myself of pouring out threats<br>  upon the town and inhabitants. The same charge you alleged more explicitly<br>  against us in the Norwich Republican of March 27<sup>th</sup>  . But you have never informed the public what those threats were.—Nor can you.<br>  None were uttered. I now declare, that I heard not a word from Mr Buffum in<br>  the tone or spirit of threat; and that not a syllable of the kind escaped my<br>  lips. I call upon you to contradict me if you please—and make your<br>  contradiction good if you can.<br></p><p>  You have taken no little pains, gentlemen, in your communication, &amp; on<br>  other occasions, to make it appear as if you and the people of Canterbury are<br>  the injured, suffering party. That you may have suffered some injury in the<br>  course of the unhappy collision, which you have awakened, is possibly true.<br>  But that any injury, any disregard to your rights and feelings was intended in<br>  the establishment of Miss Crandall’s school on its present plan, there is not<br>  the slightest reason to suppose. I can most solemnly declare, that from the<br>  first I have been willing to treat even your prejudices with some<br>  consideration. Witness my letter to Miss Crandall, dated Feb. 28<sup>th</sup>  , written so soon as I heard of the opposition you were preparing to make to<br>  the prosecution of her plan. If I had been permitted to speak for her at your<br>  town meeting, as<br>  <em>she</em>  requested I might be permitted to do, you would soon have learnt that neither<br>  Miss C. nor her patrons had any wish to force the continuance of her school in<br>  your village. They were, and I trust still are, willing to have it removed to<br>  any<br>  <em>suitable</em>  place, that might be obtained for it. In a conversation with Col. Judson a few<br>  days after the meeting, I gave him this assurance distinctly; as he doubtless<br>  remembers. His reply I shall never forget. ‘No,’ said he, ‘that school shall<br>  not be located in any part of the town of Canterbury; no—not in part of the<br>  State of Connecticut. I will get a law passed,’ he continue, ‘by our next<br>  Legislature, prohibiting the introduction of colored from other States into<br>  this for the purpose of attending school.‡ I can obtain thirty thousand<br>  signers to a petition for such a Law.’ The same overbearing, tyrannical spirit<br>  was conspicuous in that gentleman’s language and manner, at the town meeting;<br>  and has been too apparent in many of his doings since. To protect, if I may be<br>  able a lone woman from the operations of such a spirit, I have felt it my duty<br>  to stand with others between her and her oppressors. If she has done wrong, or<br>  spoken unadvisedly, let her be rebuked. I would not attempt to justify her<br>  error. But she has rights, and they must be respected. If her location in your<br>  village is disagreeable to you, and you can enable her to procure suitable<br>  accommodations elsewhere, I for one should advise her to remove, &amp; I<br>  believe all her patrons would concur in the advice. But your attempt to compel<br>  her to abandon her school, we regard as a flagrant violation of her privileges<br>  as an American citizen, and we have therefore advised her to resist, peaceably<br>  but firmly. The law which you have procured from our last Legislature, we are<br>  confident is unconstitutional, and have been so advised by able civilians.—We<br>  have therefore thought it best for Miss C. to continue her school, until the<br>  validity of that Law shall have been ascertained. If it shall be found to be<br>  indeed a good and a valid law of Connecticut, then of course Miss Crandall and<br>  her patrons will peaceably abide the consequences of her violation of it. Her<br>  school must be abandoned; and it must then be acknowledged before the world<br>  “that all men are not permitted to enjoy their unalienable rights even in<br>  New-England.\"<br></p><p>  I have more to say in reply to your communication; and shall resume my remarks<br>  next week; when I shall particularly notice the charge so often repeated by<br>  you, that false and dangerous principles are to be taught at Miss C’s school.<br></p><p>SAMUEL J. MAY</p><p>  *To preclude the possibility of an inference that the truth of this accusation<br>  is admitted, we would simply express our conviction that Miss C. has made no<br>  engagements, of which the discontinuance, or the change of her school could be<br>  considered a violation. She went to Canterbury, at least as much to confer a<br>  favor as to receive one, and was never under any more obligation to teach the<br>  children of that village, than are the merchants there to sell their goods to<br>  her or others, nor did she suppose the people of Canterbury to be obligated to<br>  send their daughters to her school, more than they were, on than she was, to<br>  purchase the commodities offered by those merchants.<br></p><p>  † See Miss Crandall’s Letter published in the Advertiser of May 9<sup>th</sup>  .<br></p><p>  ‡ Col. Judson in the earnestness of his determination to overthrow Miss<br>  Crandall’s school, threatened that there should also be a clause in his Law,<br>  by which the colored people in the State should be restrained within the towns<br>  to which they now belong, so that even their children could not be sent to<br>  Miss C. for instruction. But it seems that for some wide reason he has since<br>  concluded to omit the proposed clause.<br></p>",

JUDSON’S CIRCULAR— We have seen a Circular written by Andrew T. Judson,<br>  Canterbury, in vindication of his conduct towards Miss Crandall, and in favor<br>  of the new law, under which she was imprisoned. It is a very lame affair: much<br>  more so than we should have expected from a lawyer, aspiring to a seat in<br>  Congress. He does not even make a<br>  <em>plausible</em>  defence. The very<br>  <em>plea</em>  must insure<br>  <em>condemnation</em>  among republicans. Miss Crandall’s school, according to Mr. Judson, is to be<br>  legislated down—<br>  <em>not</em>  because colored people are not human beings—“created free and equal”—not<br>  because they are not entitled to education—<br>  <em>not</em>  because the object is undesirable—<br>  <em>not</em>  because Miss Crandall was incompetent to teach them—<br>  <em>not</em>  because the town was in danger (as had been pretended) of being overrun with<br>  paupers, but because Miss Crandall is an<br>  <em>abolitionist!</em>  A fine TEST ACT, truly! Why not because she is a Baptist? A large portion of<br>  the Baptists, and of other sects, we trust, are rapidly embracing the heresy<br>  against which “His Grace, the” [American] “Lord Bishop of Canterbury” has<br>  fulminated his papal bull. And so the abolitionists are legally disqualified<br>  from school teaching, are they? From what will they next be debarred? From<br>  preaching? From medical and from legal practice? From buying and selling? as<br>  rumor even now reports of Canterbury, and as the Revelator of Patmos has<br>  predicted, of the latter days?”&nbsp; (Rev.xiii.17.)<br></p><p>  Mr. Judson pleads in favor of Canterbury legislation, that the people of<br>  <em>other</em>  towns, would be as unwilling as those of Canterbury, to see a similar school<br>  established, and then to strengthen this, by<br>  <em>another</em>  plea, he complains because Miss Crandall did not accept his offer to remove<br>  her<br>  <em>location!</em>  This savors of the Irish, as well as of the Romish bull! Much in the same vein<br>  of logic, Mr. Judson defends the<br>  <em>Connecticut</em>  law, by remarking that schools might be established in<br>  <em>other</em>  states! Above all, the<br>  <em>present</em>  law of Connecticut,<br>  <em>against</em>  the free and unrestrained education of the colored people, Mr. Judson argues,<br>  <em>cannot</em>  be<br>  <em>bad,</em>  BECAUSE a<br>  <em>former</em>  law of that state, (as yet unrepealed—a law,—he<br>  <em>might</em>  have said—enacted when<br>  <em>all</em>  the people of Connecticut were “abolitionists,” and ere the cunning device of<br>  Colonziationism was dreamed of)—is a<br>  <em>good</em>  one and contains<br>  <em>contrary</em>  characteristics!”<br></p><p align=\"center\">“A Daniel! still I say, a second Daniel!”</p><p>  Mr. Judson must certainly be sent to Congress! –<br>  <em>Genius of Temperance</em></p>",

I have seen</p><p>The husbandman go out to labor, singing</p><p>Contentment’s song. I’ve seen the smiling harvest</p><p>Rising to meet his hopes and pay his toils.</p><p>I’ve seen his home—like Paradise, when first</p><p>The morn of Adam’s happiness beamed on it—</p><p>A wife so lovely, babes so innocent,</p><p>That earth’s best blessings seemed to centre there.</p><p>I’ve seen the busy village, and the city,</p><p>Where gathered wealth finds by a thousand channels</p><p>New means to bless mankind. I’ve also seen,”</p><p>(And angry clouds, from up the west arising,</p><p>Proclaimed a tempest near,) “I’ve also seen</p><p>Much misery.—The armies joined in battle,</p><p>The shock, the falling ranks, the vict’ry won,</p><p>The battle field, where, satiate with the carnage,</p><p>Death’s dreadful angel had retired awhile.</p><p>The widow and the widow’s boy were there,</p><p>Searching, among the mangled flesh and bones,</p><p>For what they once had husband called, and father.</p><p>The frantic maid was there, whose blue eyes streamed</p><p>Love’s last but bitterest flood, while on the clay</p><p>That once had been her lover, she arranged</p><p>The vestment, taken from a neighb’ring corpse.</p><p>True, this was sad, but far more sad the sight</p><p>Of those who sought their friends among the living,</p><p>Where liquid death mocks at the play of battle.</p><p>I saw the more than widow seek her husband</p><p>Among the bacchanals: she found him out,</p><p>And said, ‘when will you come and visit us—</p><p>Your wife and daughter—for we have no bread.’</p><p>He turned and looked a look that froze her heart,</p><p>And then, relenting, offered her the glass</p><p>To cheer her spirits! I have also seen”—</p><p>(And on his face he drew a veil of clouds,</p><p>And in the rolling thunder told the story,)</p><p><em>“I’ve seen the manacled and wretched slave</em></p><p>Lie down to take his punishment: The scourge,</p><p>Made at the shop where Patience, wearied sat,</p><p>And told Invention how ti braid the thongs,</p><p>Was brandished in the air; The slave cried out,</p><p>  ‘Good master spare, O!<br>  <em>am I not a man&gt;’</em></p><p>But cried in vain, the whip went gaily round</p><p>‘Till ‘forty stripes save one’ were fully told.</p><p>A woman came:—They heard the earnest prayer</p><p>That nature prompted.

    "description": "Extract from an Abolitionist pamphlet by Elizur Wright",
    "source": "<em>The Sin of Slavery, and its Remedy, containing some reflections on the moral influence of the American Colonization,\"</em> New York: Published for the Author, 1832",
    "subject": "Abolition",
    "transcription": "<p>  (We extract the following from Professor Wright’s pamphlet, entitled “The Sin<br>  of Slavery, and its Remedy.)<br></p><p>  The American revolution was incomplete. It left one sixth part of the<br>  population the victims of a servitude immeasurably more debasing, than that<br>  from which it delivered the rest. While this nation held up its declaration of<br>  independence—its noble bill of human rights, before an admiring world, in one<br>  hand; it mortified the friends of humanity, by oppressing the poor and<br>  defenceless with the other. The progress of time has not lessened the evil.<br>  There are now held in involuntary and perpetual slavery, in the southern half<br>  of this republic, more than 2,000,000 of men, women, and children, guarded<br>  with a vigilance, which strives, and with success appalling as it is complete,<br>  to shut out every ray of knowledge, human and divine, and reduce them as<br>  nearly as possible to a level with the brutes. These miserable slaves are not<br>  only compelled to labor without choice and without hire, but they are<br>  subjected to the cruelty and lust of their masters to an unbounded extent. I<br>  the northern states there is very generally a sympathy with the slave-holders,<br>  and a prejudice against the slaves, which shows itself in palliating the crime<br>  of slave-holding, and in most unrighteously disregarding the rights, and<br>  vilifying the characters of the free colored men.<br></p><p>  At the same time, slavery, as a system, is (in a certain sense) condemned. It<br>  is confessed to be a great evil, “a moral evil,” and, when the point is urged,<br>  <em>a sin.</em>  The slaves, it is admitted, have rights—every principle of honesty, justice,<br>  and humanity,<br>  <em>“in the abstract,”</em>  calls aloud that they should be made free. The word of God is in their favour.<br>  Indeed, there is no ground claimed by the abettors of slavery, on which they<br>  pretend to justify it for a moment, but a supposed—a begged—<br>  <em>expediency,</em>  baseless as the driven clouds. I say baseless, for while not a single fact has<br>  ever been produced, going to show the danger of putting the slaves, all at<br>  once, under the protection of law, and employing them as free laborers, there<br>  have been produced, on the other side, varied and fair experiments showing,<br>  that it is altogether safe and profitable.<br></p><p>  In this state of things where had the American church stood? Has she too<br>  sympathized with the hearts of the Pharaohs? Or has she in the spirit of the<br>  martyrs of former times, borne an unflinching testimony against this sin?<br>  Alas! The painful truth stares us in the face. She has come down from the high<br>  and firm foundation of scripture truth, and is professedly at work upon a<br>  floating<br>  <em>expediency,</em>  doing against slavery what cab be done upon the checked current of popular<br>  prejudice.—Speaking through the organ of the Colonization Society, she has<br>  admitted all that the most determined slave-holder could ask, and she is doing<br>  just that, and no more, which so far as he understands the subject, he hails<br>  with pleasure as a safeguard to is property in human bodies and<br>  <em>souls.</em>  This is the testimony of slave-holders themselves—most competent witnesses.<br></p><p>  Is further evidence needed? When the American Colonization Society, as a<br>  remedy for slavery, has been called in question, as well it might be for its<br>  tardiness, if for no other reason, there has been manifested a determination<br>  to hush inquiry. There has been a most pusillanimous shivering and shrinking<br>  from the probe. Nay, the few men who, in the uncompromising spirit of<br>  Christian benevolence, have urged this inquiry, have been slandered as<br>  disturbers of the public peace,—have been assailed with abusive epithets, not<br>  be slave-holders only, but by their brethren in the bosom of the church.<br></p><p>  A most singular spectacle is presented in this enlightened and Christian age;<br>  a handful of philanthropists, dare denounce a system of legalized oppression,<br>  and to charge guilt upon all who uphold it; upon this, not only do the<br>  principals in crime, as might be expected, ascribe the whole to sheer malice,<br>  but the leaders of the Christian church, as ought not to be expected, endorse,<br>  and give currency to the charge, and throw the whole weight of their cold and<br>  crushing influence to smother in its cradle this attempt at a gospel<br>  reformation.<br></p><p>  What does all this mean? Are Christians in these northern states interested in<br>  upholding slavery? Are they unwilling to be convinced that their colored<br>  brethren are better than the slanders of their oppressors would make them? Are<br>  they sure, beyond a doubt, that the colonization scheme will relieve our<br>  country of the might evil which is crushing it? that it is the<br>  <em>Christian</em>  way to relieve it? Are they on good evidence convinced that it is not<br>  <em>expedient</em>  to say to the wicked, “O wicked man, thou shalt surely die?” Must they have<br>  PEACE at any rate—peace, though the groans of millions should ascend and<br>  mingle with the muttering thunders of coming wrath? Will they have it, that if<br>  a word is said against a mere experiment to test the practicability of<br>  rescuing the victim by flattering the oppressor, the whole cause of Christian<br>  benevolence is attacked? If not, why not welcome inquiry? A thorough<br>  investigation—a looking on<br>  <em>both sides,</em>  would surely do no harm. Those defenders of truth who have shunned such<br>  inquiry, have always proved themselves short-sighted. The cause of God courts<br>  scrutiny—its advocates are thrown into no unseemly agitation when they are<br>  most rigorously sifted.<br></p><p>  The subject cries aloud for more earnest consideration than it has yet<br>  received. More than two millions of outraged, downtrodden men cry out, shall<br>  we die in this sore bondage that white Christians may have the pleasure of<br>  attempting to shun God’s wrath without repenting of sin?—Half a million of<br>  free colored men cry out—America is our country—the land for which<br>  <em>our</em>  fathers bled as well as yours. Why will you seek to banish us? The wrongs of<br>  the poor Indian cry aloud, There is no safety in league with transgressors!<br>  The present political aspect of the South [cries out, that tyrants do not<br>  regard law! Six hundred millions of idolaters cry out to the American church,<br>  “Why pluckest thou the mote out of thy brother’s eye, and behold a beam is in<br>  thine own!”<br></p>",

Their<br>  fair images of human perfection, must chaunt their joys to “babbling<br>  brooks”—must sigh out their griefs to an accompaniment of aquatic melody, and<br>  “mingle their tears with the torrents as they fall.”<br></p><p>  Nor do rivers appear by any means contemptible in the pages of the historian.<br>  Who has not heard the fame of the Nile, that source of Egypt, prosperity, and<br>  that proverbial emblem of a truly benevolent man? As signs the poet,<br></p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Bounteous<br>  as the Nile’s dark waters,<br></p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>  “Undiscovered as their spring.”<br></p><p>  And who has not read of the Jordan, which beheld the course and fled backward<br>  at the approach of Jehovah’s chosen tribes? Of the Granicus, where the world’s<br>  conqueror first met and scattered the countless hosts of Persia? Of the cold<br>  Cydnus, which had well nigh checked the rash victor’s headlong career? Of the<br>  sacred Ganges, whose waters cleanse from moral pollution? Of the yellow Tiber,<br>  that laves the walls of the Eternal City? Of the Rubicon, where the aspiring<br>  Roman decided between his ambition and the better feelings of his heart, and<br>  threw the torch of civil war among the combustible materials of the old<br>  world’s proudest empire?<br></p><p>  The traveler who visits lands renowned in ancient story, finds nothing in the<br>  relics of their former grandeur, better fitted to impress the mind with that<br>  sensation of pleasing sadness which memorials of other days call up, than the<br>  broad streams, {unreadable due to a fold} reflected tower, palace, and temple,<br>  glittering in the sunbeams, and whose shores echoed to the ceaseless hum of a<br>  crowded city’s busy population, where now, solitude, desolation, and silence,<br>  reign amid the fallen arches, the broken columns, and the mouldering ruins of<br>  structures which the vain architect of former days reared in ponderous and<br>  massy strength, as if defying the destroyer Time. How forcibly is he impressed<br>  with the vanity of human greatness, as he surveys the quiet stream, rolling on<br>  its channel, heedless of the desolation around, unchanged by the mighty<br>  revolutions that have swept from the face of day, cities, states, and<br>  empires—regardless alike of chieftains, kinds, and conquerors, who once dyed<br>  its waves with the purple tide of slaughter, or received on its banks the<br>  homage of conquered millions, and of the slaves who basely bowed the knee in<br>  servile adoration, to the mortal god. The noble Tigris still holds its onward<br>  course, unaltered since the haughty walls of Nineveh overhung its banks, and<br>  her six score thousand inhabitants who knew not the right hand from the left,<br>  listened to the prophet of the Lord warning them of speedy destruction. The<br>  famed Euphrates ceases not to flow, though the “queen of cities” is a desert<br>  waste, and long ages have elapsed since Chaldea heard the voice of wailing and<br>  the loud lament, “Babylon is fallen, is fallen.” Xanthus and Scamander still<br>  water the plains of Asia Minor, though the towers of Priam have crumbled into<br>  dust, and the bright glory of Ilium has vanished like a vision of the night.<br></p><p>  And when the grave in its silence and its gloom shall have closed over all of<br>  life and activity the earth now contains; when the grand and beautiful works<br>  of art which we behold, shall be as the magnificence of Babylon or of Troy;<br>  when we shall have taken up our abode in the cold chambers of darkness, “and<br>  the places that now know us shall know us no more;” when our names shall fall<br>  on the listener’s ear like the faint echo of a distant voice, or the dim<br>  recollections of a half forgotten dream; when the finger of decay shall have<br>  erased the records of our achievements, and our deeds shall be remembered as<br>  the traditionary legends of antiquity; when the generations that succeed us<br>  shall have faded from the earth like the passing shadow of a thin and fleecy<br>  cloud; the lovely streams by which we delight to rove, will still wind through<br>  the vallies [sic], diffusing verdure and fertility in their path; the cataract<br>  will still leap “in thunder and in foam,” from the rocky brow of the<br>  precipice, sending up its sparkling spray to glitter in the dazzling<br>  sun-light, and to crown its front with a halo of varying and respondent hues;<br>  the calm and stately current of the might river will still sweep on in majesty<br>  to the ocean, shaded perhaps by the thick boughs of the giant oak or gloomy<br>  pine, and fringed with shrubs and blooming wild flowers, where<br>  <em>we</em>  behold reflected in its pellucid mirror, the spire of the village church, and<br>  the thickly crowded habitations of men; and where now it visits but the forest<br>  haunts of roving savages and beasts of prey, or glides through glens untrod by<br>  human footsteps, and undisturbed by voice or sound, save the ripple of the<br>  waters below &amp; the rustle of leaf and branch above, shall then be seen the<br>  snow-white sail wafting along its tranquil tide the rich product of<br>  agricultural industry and commercial enterprise.<br></p><p>  A new race shall have risen to possess the heritage of their fathers, to walk<br>  among the ruins of our splendid edifices, to gaze on the streams that we<br>  admire, and while they gaze, to muse as we do now, and as hundreds before us<br>  have done, on the fleeting evanescence of earthly fame, and the shadowy<br>  illusiveness of human grandeur.<br></p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “So passes<br>  this world’s glory.”<br></p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>  <em>We, the People.</em></p>",

She entered a demurrer to the complaint, the Court<br>  judged the complaint sufficient and thereupon ordered Miss Crandall to give<br>  bond with surety in the sum of $150, for her appearance before the next County<br>  Court to be tried on said complaint, and abide the judgment of said Court<br>  thereon. Failing to procure bonds, she was committed to prison. The cause came<br>  on for trial before the County Court on Friday, August 23d: C.F. Cleaveland,<br>  Esq. the Attorney for the State, being absent from indisposition, the Court<br>  appointed Jonathan A. Welch, Esq. special attorney to conduct the prosecution.<br>  A.T. Judson and I. Bulkley, Esqrs. were associate counsel.&nbsp; Hon. Calvin<br>  Goddard, Hon. W. W. Ellsworth and Henry Strong, Esq. appeared for the defence.<br>  The jury being empannelled and sworn, the counsel for the defence objected to<br>  one of the jurors from Canterbury on the ground that he had signed petitions,<br>  &amp;c. in respect to Miss Crandall’s school, and taken active measures to put<br>  it down. The Court sustained the objection, and the juror was excused. They<br>  also objected to another of the jurors on the ground that he was a member of<br>  the Legislature which passed the law, was one of those who voted for it, and<br>  had, of course, formed an opinion with respect to its constitutionality. The<br>  Court decided that the juror was competent to sit. (He got excused, however,<br>  on account of sickness.) The information against Miss Crandall consisted of<br>  two counts. The first charged “that the said Prudence Crandall, on the 24<sup>th</sup>  day of June last, with force, and arms, in a certain school which before that<br>  time had been and then was set up in said Canterbury, for the instruction and<br>  teaching of colored persons, to wit: Theodosia De Grasse, Ann Peterson, Amelia<br>  Elizabeth Wilder, Ann Eliza Hammond, and others whose names are unknown, who<br>  at the time so taught and instructed were not inhabitants of any town in this<br>  state, which said acts were done, by the said Prudence Crandall, without the<br>  consent, in writing, first had and obtained of a majority of the civil<br>  authority and select men of the said town of Canterbury, within which said<br>  school was then instructed, against the peace of this state, and contrary to<br>  the form and effect of the statute in such case made and provided.”<br></p><p>  The second count charged “that the defendant, with force and arms did wilfully<br>  and knowingly harbor and board, and aid and assist in harboring and boarding<br>  certain colored persons (named above,) who, when so harbored and boarded, were<br>  not inhabitants of any town in this State—without the consent in writing of<br>  the civil authority and select men, &amp;c.”<br></p><p>Plea, Not Guilty.</p><p>The following witnesses were then called on the part of the prosecution.</p><p>  <em>Asahel Bacon</em>  said that he had called at Miss Crandall’s house in the month of June last,<br>  having heard that she had taken some scholars from abroad. Capt. Sanger<br>  accompanied him. They were both select men of the town. Miss Crandall invited<br>  them into her house very politely. They asked her in relation to her scholars.<br>  She said she had four who were from New York and one from Hartford.—She called<br>  them in and introduced them. Theodosia De Grass, Amelia Elizabeth Wildes, and<br>  Catherine Ann Weldon, he thinks were the names of those called. Witness did<br>  not remember the day of the month that he called—thinks it was the day after<br>  the girls came—certainly soon after.<br></p><p>  <em>Ebenezer Sanger</em>  coincided in the statement of Mr. Bacon.<br></p><p>  <em>George Cady</em>  had conversed with Miss Crandall—went to her house on Friday last to summon as<br>  witnesses to support this prosecution, some of the girls who were attending<br>  the school. One of those named in this subpoena said that she had been sent<br>  for him, on account of the sickness of her mother, and wished him to excuse<br>  her attendance at Court—told her that he could not, but would state the<br>  circumstances to the public prosecutor. Miss Crandall said that she did not<br>  see that there was any need of witnesses at all, for she should confess that<br>  she had broken the law.<br></p><p>  <em>Ann Peterson,</em>  This witness was a colored girl, said to be a pupil of Miss Crandall, and was<br>  one of those named in the information to whom Miss C. had given instruction.<br>  Mr. Ellsworth objected to the examination of the witness on the ground that<br>  she could not testify without implicating herself. Mr. Welch read the clause<br>  of the statute under which this prosecution was sustained, in which it was<br>  enacted that the pupils in a school kept contrary to the act, might be<br>  compelled to testify. Mr. Ellsworth said that he denied, altogether, the<br>  competency of the Legislature to compel a witness to testify, or answer<br>  questions that might implicate him, even to render himself liable in<br>  debt—otherwise a witness might be compelled to testify to what would charge<br>  him with the crime of murder. He alluded to the State Constitution and Bill or<br>  Rights which he claimed protected every person from criminating himself by<br>  being compelled to give testimony. It was contrary to fundamental principles.<br>  In this case the witness might make herself an aider and abettor, and subject<br>  herself to the penalties imposed by the statute. Mr. Judson claimed that the<br>  witness would not by her testimony implicate herself. The law was penal, and<br>  must be construed strictly. Even if she was aware that she was instructed by<br>  Miss Crandall, it would not charge herself with any crime. Mr. Judson read at<br>  length from Starkie on evidence, to show that the witness ought, on common law<br>  principles, to be examined, and was bound to answer questions as to what she<br>  knew of Miss C.’s school. At all events he claimed that, in this instance,<br>  such must be the case as the Legislature had expressly enacted that the pupils<br>  should be witnesses. Mr. Ellsworth, in reply, said he apprehended the question<br>  to be whether the Legislature possessed the power to compel a witness to<br>  convict himself. He read from the opinion of Chief Justice Hosmer, in the 8<sup>th</sup>  Con. Rep. and also from the case of the people vs. Mather, in 4<sup>th</sup>  Wendell’s Reps on the subject of examining witnesses.&nbsp; By the principles<br>  decided these cases, which were the settled law of the land, he claimed that<br>  the witness was not compelled to answer any questions in relation to her<br>  knowledge of this school. The Court decided that the witness, under the<br>  circumstances, was not protected, but must be examined.—The examination was<br>  about to proceed, when Mr. Ellsworth rose and stated to the Court that the<br>  witness had been advised not to answer interrogatories in regard to her<br>  knowledge of this school. He felt it to be his duty now to repeat this advice.<br>  He wished the Court, however, distinctly to understand that the counsel for<br>  the accused had taken this course not with a view to embarrass the trial, but<br>  solely from a sense of duty. He conscientiously believed that the legal rights<br>  of the witness were such that she should not be compelled to testify. The<br>  Counsel for the prosecution, asked the witness when she came to Canterbury,<br>  but she declined answering the question. A number of other questions were then<br>  proposed to the witness, the principal of which were—“Has Miss Crandall kept a<br>  school for colored girls not inhabitants of this state?”—“Will you say whether<br>  the defendant has or has not instructed any person of color other than<br>  yourself since the 10<sup>th</sup>  of June last, or boarded and instructed colored persons not inhabitants of<br>  this state?” To all these and other questions of a similar character, the<br>  witness decline giving an answer, on the ground that she could not do so<br>  without criminating herself. The counsel for the prosecution then called<br>  <em>Catherine Ann Weldon</em>  and<br>  <em>Eliza Hammond,</em>  both girls of color, and charged with being pupils of Miss Crandall, and<br>  propounded to them the same questions as above; but they for the same reason,<br>  and by the advice of counsel, declined answering. The prosecuting Attorney<br>  reserved to himself, though he waived for the present, the right of moving for<br>  an order that these witnesses be committed for a contempt of court.<br></p><p>  <em>Jacob C. Gould</em>  said he was acquainted with Ann Eliza Hammond. She belonged to Providence R.I.<br>  had known her since she was a child—was the daughter of Thomas Hammond, who<br>  died in 1826. Her mother now lived in Providence—the father at his death was<br>  worth from 1500 to $2000 in real estate.<br></p><p>  <em>Levi Kneeland,</em>  Was not connected with Miss Crandall’s school except as an adviser in relation<br>  to it—was pastor of the Church to which Miss Crandall belonged—had seen<br>  several of the colored girls who were present at his church during the summer.<br>  In reply to a question whether he had seen one of the girls elsewhere than at<br>  his church declined answering. In reply to the question whether he had not<br>  seen one of them at Miss Crandall’s, declined answering—decline to answer<br>  whether he had advised Miss Crandall in relation to her school. Declined<br>  answering whether or not he had been in Miss Crandall’s school since the 10<sup>th</sup>  of June last. The court, having decided that he was bound to answer the<br>  questions put to him, and that the reasons he offered for refusing to do so,<br>  namely, that he might subject himself to a prosecution, and entangle himself<br>  in difficulties, were insufficient, granted a motion for a mittimus to commit<br>  him to prison and he was taken into custody by the Sheriff.<br></p><p>  <em>Eliza Parkis</em>  (a woman of color) was acquainted with Ann Eliza Hammond, one of the girls<br>  that Miss Crandall was charged with having instructed. Has seen her in<br>  Providence—has also seen her at Miss Crandall’s, and slept in a room with Miss<br>  De Grasse a colored girl from New York. Miss Crandall employed witness to work<br>  for her, because she said she did not wish to keep her scholars out of school<br>  to do the work. Never saw any of the girls in school.—Have seen them have<br>  books and study them.<br></p><p>  <em>Rowland Greene</em>  (affirmed) Has often heard that Miss Crandall kept a school for colored girls<br>  in Canterbury—has been at the house often, was called as a physician—went<br>  there and saw several colored girls—heard some of them recite in grammar,<br>  geography, &amp;c. Some of the girls has been at his own house. Has seen a<br>  little girl there, said to be from New York—has heard Miss Crandall talk<br>  concerning her scholars from abroad—does not recollect to have heard her say<br>  that they were from New York.<br></p><p>  <em>Mr. Kneeland</em>  was not placed at the bar by the Sheriff at his request, and said he intended<br>  no disrespect to the Court by declining to answer the interrogatories put to<br>  him, and being advised that he should not implicate himself by doing so, he<br>  was ready to answer. He proceeded to state that he had visited Miss Crandall’s<br>  school twice. Once it was under the charge of another person. He had prayed in<br>  the school and conversed with the girls on religious subjects—does not<br>  remember faces as well as people in general—could not therefore positively<br>  identify any one of those present as being the ones seen at Miss<br>  Crandall’s—should think they were—his best belief on the subject would be a<br>  guess—has taken meals at Miss Crandall’s and eaten with her pupils—has heard<br>  them recite their lessons—thinks he has heard Miss Hammond spoken of either by<br>  the defendant or her sister. Miss Crandall has conversed with him in relation<br>  to her scholars—thinks she has told him that some of them were from New York,<br>  and some from Providence and New-Haven.<br></p><p>  <em>Albert Hinckley,</em>  has been at Miss Crandall’s several times since the month of June last—does<br>  not know whether he has been in her school room as he knows not in which room<br>  it is kept, has not conversed with her on the subject of the residence of her<br>  scholars—called on her as a friend and conversed on various topics—has heard<br>  that she kept a school for colored persons—has heard her speak of her scholars<br>  and school—has seen colored ladies at her house and has taken tea with<br>  them—cannot say whether any of those present were the ones or not.<br></p><p>  <em>Eliza Glasko,</em>  This witness was a colored girl belonging to the school but an inhabitant of<br>  this state. The same objection was made to examining her as was before made in<br>  respect to the others, but the objection was overruled by the Court. She<br>  however declined answering the questions propounded to her. The prosecuting<br>  attorney moved the court for a mittimus to commit the witness for contempt of<br>  court. The court granted the motion and ordered the clerk to make out a<br>  mittimus.<br></p><p>  <em>Hezekiah Crandall,</em>  (affirmed) His sister Prudence keeps a school at Canterbury for colored<br>  girls—knows Ann Eliza Hammond—could not certainly recognize any other that was<br>  present except perhaps Ann Peterson—has never been in the school nor heard the<br>  pupils recite—has seen Ann Eliza Hammond at his sisters, often, during June<br>  and July,—supposed she boarded there and was instructed by his sisters with<br>  others—knows by sight and name Amelia Wildes—does not know where she is<br>  now—has not heard his sister say any thing on the subject of her school for<br>  some time—she has resided in Canterbury some portion of the time for twelve<br>  years past.<br></p><p>  <em>James Chandler</em>  said he was at Miss Crandall’s several times last spring (not being able to<br>  say with certainty whether he had been there since the passage of the law he<br>  was not interrogated farther.)<br></p><p>  <em>George Roberts</em>  went to Miss Crandall’s about five months ag and carried a colored girl, Miss<br>  Hammond to the school—Miss Hammond it was said belonged to Providence, has<br>  been at Miss C’s since that time perhaps within ten weeks and drank tea—he<br>  then saw Miss Hammond but does not know whether she boarded there constantly<br>  or not—he heard her and other colored girls recite in Miss Crandall’s<br>  school—should think this was two or three months ago—has been at Miss C’s<br>  within a week but did not as he remembers see any of the girls present there<br>  at that time.<br></p><p>  <em>Mary Benson</em>  (affirmed) Has been at Miss Crandall’s school and found it very<br>  interesting—was never present but for a short time—‘tis for colored<br>  persons—saw Ann Eliza Hammond there—she is one of the scholars and boards with<br>  Miss C.—Witness recognized several of those present as among the number she<br>  had seen at Miss Crandall’s—one of the pupils, Ann Weldon was from<br>  New-York—Miss Hammond was from Providence—witness was at Miss Crandall’s five<br>  weeks since and took tea—several colored girls were at the table—does not know<br>  where any of them belonged except by report—visited the school when it was<br>  near closing and heard Miss C. give the girls instruction in Geography and<br>  Arithmetic. The prosecuting Attorney here rested his evidence, and the sheriff<br>  having served his process on Eliza Glasko was about committing her to prison,<br>  when Mr. Ellsworth interposed and stated to the court that rather than have<br>  the girl committed he should advise her to testify—again repeating that the<br>  course of the defendant’s counsel in relation to the testimony of these girls,<br>  was dictated by an imperious sense of professional duty.<br></p><p>  <em>Eliza Glasko</em>  the proceeded to give testimony. She said she was a member of Miss C’s school,<br>  and that the other girls near her were also members—one of them from<br>  Providence, the other said to be from New-York—the ordinary branches were<br>  taught them by Miss C.—reading, writing, grammar, geography, &amp;c., witness<br>  begun to go on the first of April—the school was usually opened and closed<br>  with prayer—the scriptures were read and explained daily in the school—some<br>  portions were committed to memory by the pupils and considered a part of their<br>  education.<br></p><p>Mr. Judson then opened the case on the part of the prosecution.</p><p>  He first stated the case and read the Act of the Legislature which he claimed<br>  that Miss Crandall had violated. He said that this act did not prevent any<br>  black from attending the district schools in the State, or any higher<br>  schools—that they had all the benefits of the school und, and might attend the<br>  academies, high schools, or colleges, and that too whether they were citizens<br>  of this state, of other states, or of any part of the world. The sole<br>  intention and provision of the act was, that colored persons, from another<br>  jurisdiction, should not be intruded into any town in this state, without a<br>  written permission from the select men and civil authority of the town in<br>  which they proposed to reside. This was all, and this was perfectly lawful.<br>  The whole tenor and effect of the law was to place a school for colored<br>  persons under the care and supervision of the select men and civil authority<br>  of each town. He should ask the attention of the Court to the face that the<br>  Legislature had exercised a controlling power over schools within the limits<br>  of the state since 1717. (Mr. Judson here read from an old edition of the<br>  statutes, in respect to the power which the Legislature had exercised over<br>  schools in respect to preventing disorders and the application of the public<br>  money.)—These said Mr. Judson, were schools for the instruction of all<br>  classes, and the acts which he had read, showed that the Legislature thought<br>  proper to exercise care over these schools. Such was the ancient policy of the<br>  state, and this new law was no change of policy. The state owed its present<br>  honors, its present glories, to pursuing this policy of keepings its schools<br>  under a supervising power. Nor was there anything in the Constitution of the<br>  United States to prevent it. Towns, he claimed, had a right to say who should<br>  be allowed to become inhabitants be residence in their limits and this law<br>  gave them no more power than was necessary for the exercise of that right.<br>  That the law was illiberal and reflected disgrace on the State, on the<br>  Legislature which enacted it, he denied. On the contrary, said Mr. J., there<br>  are now more than 1500 schools in the state, supported by our fund of<br>  $1,800,000, to which blacks may go without the payment of a cent. Small as the<br>  state was, smaller than single counties in some other states, these facts were<br>  true concerning it. For himself he was proud of it. Where could a parallel be<br>  found in the universe?<br></p><p>  Public policy, continued Mr. J., absolutely demands that a law of this<br>  description should be maintained. It was claimed to be unconstitutional<br>  because exclusive in its operation on a particular class. Other laws of the<br>  state were liable to the same objection. Physicians and lawyers were instances<br>  of the operation of our exclusive law. Tanners, Taverners, Surveyors, &amp;c.<br>  must all be licensed. Manufactories were liable to be visited by the select<br>  men and civil authority for the purpose of seeing that the children employed<br>  in them were properly educated. If persons came here from other states and set<br>  up manufacturing establishments they were equally liable to be visited in this<br>  way though no such provisions existed in the laws of the states from whence<br>  they come. Lawyers in this state could not purchase choses (??) in action. All<br>  these laws, with many similar ones, were passed in derogation of rights<br>  originally common to all; public policy however, required the enactment of<br>  them, as it did of the one in question, and in his opinion they all stood on<br>  similar grounds, and were, without question, in accordance with the<br>  Constitution.<br></p><p>  Mr. J. next referred to the course which other states had pursued in<br>  legislating on the subject of the blacks. He remarked on the law of Ohio. Our<br>  law is not, said Mr. J., an act of exclusion, nor an act of prohibition. It<br>  does not pretend to send away those who belong here, nor does it prohibit any<br>  from coming, but only makes it necessary that permission be first obtained.<br>  The laws of Georgia and North Carolina went so far as to authorise the<br>  imprisonment of blacks who came within their limits, even though they came in<br>  the capacity of cooks and stewards of vessels. In Tennessee blacks could not<br>  come from other states and remain within the state above twelve days without<br>  incurring penalties. In Maryland a man could not manumit his slave without his<br>  leaving the state. Even in Pennsylvania, “the land of Penn,” no free negro<br>  could remain without giving bonds for his support. All these laws Mr. J.<br>  claimed to be obnoxious to equal and indeed to greater constitutional<br>  objections than the one in question. The article in the constitution of the<br>  United States with which this law was supposed to conflict, he understood to<br>  be, the 2d section of the 4<sup>th</sup>  article:—“The citizens of each state shall be entitled to all the privileges<br>  and immunities of citizens in the several states.” Mr. J. claimed that the<br>  term “citizens” in this place, and throughout the constitution, had a<br>  technical signification—a legal meaning—that it did not include colored<br>  persons—that they were not be the constitution recognized as citizens. A<br>  certain class of colored persons, slaves) were in it considered as property.<br></p><p>  Mr. J. here referred to the laws of the United State on the subject of<br>  naturalization, reading from Ingersoll’s Digest, the several acts of Congress,<br>  and insisted that from them all, the language being precise, technical, and<br>  certain, none other than white persons could be naturalized citizens of the<br>  United States. He also read from the 2<sup>nd</sup>  Kent’s Com. 70, 71, 72, by which he further illustrated these views.<br></p><p>  There have been, continued Mr. J., concurrent acts of the State of Connecticut<br>  which give the same construction to the constitution. If “citizen” do not mean<br>  a white person only—if it be claimed that a black is a citizen, then is the<br>  constitution of our own State a nullity, for it allows “free white males”<br>  alone to be electors. The privilege of being a freeman, he claimed, to be a<br>  higher one that the right of being educated. Why should a man be educated who<br>  could not be a freeman? A person who pays a single cent State tax, or who does<br>  military duty, is entitled to the privilege of voting. In Massachusetts these<br>  qualifications were not sufficient. Each state in the Union has these local<br>  laws and customs peculiar to itself—these must all be abrogated at a blow, by<br>  deciding the law in question to be unconstitutional. Full effect however,<br>  might be given to the clause in the constitution, referred to without<br>  producing this result, and that was, by construing the term “citizen” in the<br>  manner he had before pointed out.<br></p><p>  The first act in our own statute would be nullified by a decision that this<br>  law was unconstitutional—a citizen of another State cannot maintain an action<br>  in our courts for any cause unless a substantial inhabitant of the State give<br>  bond for him. No one has doubted the constitutionality of this law, and the<br>  law in question, with respect to constitutionality, could not be distinguished<br>  from it.<br></p><p>  Mr. J. said he should conclude his remarks on this subject by alluding merely<br>  to one other argument in support of this law, and that was, that the public<br>  safety of this State, the preservation of its true interests, required this<br>  law to be enforced. The southern States might emancipate their slaves and send<br>  them all to Connecticut instead of Liberia. The influx of that species of<br>  population might be so great as to be overwhelming. (Mr. J. proceeded to<br>  remark on the effect which recent measures of the British Parliament, on the<br>  subject of slavery, might have on this question, when he was interrupted by<br>  the court, who remarked that tho’ far from inclined to restrain all the limits<br>  of the discussion, yet it did not seem pertinent to the issue to argue the<br>  policy or expediency of the laws. Mr. J. said he would not press the point.)<br>  Mr. J. hoped that he had not been misunderstood in the remarks he had made. He<br>  wished not to oppress any class of population. He heartily wished that every<br>  slave might be emancipated that every day. But if it could not be done without<br>  destruction to our constitutions, and desolating our land, he could not desire<br>  it.<br></p><p>  He would only add to the Jury that though it was true they were at liberty to<br>  consider what the court said to them on the subject of the law, as advice,<br>  still he hoped they would pay it such respect as advice from the bench was<br>  properly entitled to. A single word as to the facts. The information charged<br>  the defendant with boarding and instructing, in different counts. It was<br>  sufficient if they found her guilty on either. The day was immaterial. If they<br>  found her guilty of doing the act charged on any day, since the passage of the<br>  law, and before the filing of the information, ‘twas sufficient. It was not<br>  necessary that they should find that she had boarded or instructed each of the<br>  persons named in the information; to instruct or board one was a transgression<br>  of the law.<br></p><p>As to the proof it was abundant, conclusive.</p><p>  Mr. Ellsworth, after stating the case, and remarking on the prohibitions of<br>  the law, said that he proposed not to occupy time in relation to the facts of<br>  the case. He would willingly have advised the pupils of Miss Crandall to have<br>  testified had he not believed that in so doing they voluntarily surrendered<br>  their most sacred rights. True it was, the defendant has kept this<br>  school—‘twas no secret, and whether that constituted a crime or not was for<br>  the jury to determine. In order to convict my client, said Mr. E., you<br>  gentlemen, must find on your oaths that she had committed a crime. You may<br>  find that she has violated an act of the State Legislature, but if you also<br>  find her protected by a higher power, it will be your duty to acquit. The<br>  court he was fully assured, would charge the jury that the law was<br>  unconstitutional, I they so believed, but after all, it belonged to the people<br>  to determine whether one of them had been guilty of a crime. Each one of the<br>  jury must be satisfied for himself alone, that a crime has been committed. He<br>  flattered himself that he should be able to lead them to the conclusion that<br>  the law in question was a violation of the constitution of this State and of<br>  the United States. The constitution of the United States was the highest power<br>  known in our land. Beyond that, no Legislature can go and if the jury find the<br>  law not to stand well with the constitution they must say so.<br></p><p>  The real question for the jury to settle Mr. Ellsworth apprehended to be this:<br>  Can the Legislature of Connecticut pass a law prohibiting the citizens of<br>  other States from coming into this State, and&nbsp; there residing, to<br>  prosecute the acquisition of knowledge, in a way open to the citizens of this<br>  State. This he believed was the precise question, and it reached deep and<br>  wide—wider and deeper than was perhaps imagined. It was however claimed by his<br>  friend from Canterbury, that colored persons were not citizens, and that the<br>  provisions of the constitution, with respect to citizens of the United States,<br>  did not apply to this class of our population. The criterion of citizenship<br>  was complexion in the view of the gentleman who had preceded him. I said Mr.<br>  E., make the criterion to be either birth or naturalization. Admitting that<br>  none but white persons can be naturalized, it does not touch the question of<br>  citizenship by birth. Is it so that a person born on our soil, is not a<br>  citizen of our soil? In the days of Revolution, said Mr. E., these men fought<br>  side by side with our fathers, and shed their blood for their country—the<br>  country to which they owed indefeasible allegiance. Their names were now<br>  inscribed on the Pension Rolls of the Government—they now received the<br>  honorable trophies of the services they had rendered. Where, said Mr. E., does<br>  the gentleman get the doctrine that the rights of man, as a citizen, depend<br>  upon his color? A colored man could appeal to the laws for the protection of<br>  his rights in ever State could he, if he were not a citizen? (Mr. E. here read<br>  a few sentences from the commencement of the declaration of independence,<br>  which, he said, according to the argument of the gentleman opposed to him,<br>  ought to be changed so as to have the words “except black people” introduced<br>  between each clause,) Mr. E. said he was a republican, he claimed to be as<br>  much a republican as his friend from Canterbury, and he hoped that his friend<br>  was not so ashamed of his republicanism, as to wish this instrument, the<br>  Declaration of Independence, interpolated in this manner. Our own<br>  constitution, continued Mr. E., recognized, in express terms, equality of<br>  rights—that men were equal in rights, but to this the gentleman would add<br>  “except black men.” He hoped he should not live long enough to see such<br>  doctrine go forth from Connecticut. The free colored population has, and is<br>  justly entitled, to equal representation in the Congress of the United States<br>  with the white population. Could not a black man commit treason? The gentleman<br>  would have it that he could not, for none other than citizens can. (Mr. E.<br>  here read from the 2<sup>nd</sup>  Kent’s Com on the subject of citizenship, by birth.) I scout the idea, said<br>  Mr. E., that a man, born here by the side of me, is not a citizen because, his<br>  father was black, while I am a citizen because mine was white.<br></p><p>  [The remainder of Mr. Ellsworth’s argument next week together with those of<br>  Messrs.

    "transcription": "<p align=\"center\">DREADFUL EFFECTS OF IMMEDIATE EMANCIPATION</p><p align=\"center\">[From a pamphlet recently published in England.}</p><p>  Of the many persons who declare themselves averse to slavery and yet afraid to<br>  join in measures for its abolition, some perhaps have not paid much attention<br>  to the instances of emancipation that have already taken place. If any such<br>  will take the trouble to read the following account of the effects of<br>  emancipation as far as it has hitherto been tried, they will perhaps see that<br>  their fears on the subject are not justified by experience.<br></p><p>  The History of Hayti when separated from the accidental circumstances<br>  attending it, furnishes irrefragable evidence of the safety and advantage of<br>  immediate emancipation. It is true that much blood was shed there during the<br>  French revolution; but this was not owing to the emancipation of the slaves,<br>  but was the consequence either of the civil war which preceded the act of<br>  emancipation; or of the atrocious attempt to restore slavery.<br></p><p>  In September, 1793, Polvirel, one of the Commissioners sent to St. Domingo by<br>  the National Convention, issues a proclamation declaring the whole of the<br>  slaves in the island free. Colonel Malenfant, a slave proprietor, resident at<br>  the time in the island, thus describes the effects of this sudden measure.<br>  “After this public act of emancipation, the Negroes remained quiet both in the<br>  south and in the west, and they continued to work upon all the plantations.<br>  There were estates which had neither owners nor managers resident upon them,<br>  and on those estates where no white men were left to direct them, they betook<br>  themselves to the planting of provisions; but upon all plantations where the<br>  whites resided, the blacks continued to labor as quietly as before.” Colonel<br>  Malenfant says, that when many of his neighbors, proprietors or managers, were<br>  in prison, the negroes of their plantations came to him to beg him to direct<br>  them in their work. “If you will take care not to talk to them of the<br>  restoration of slavery, but talk to them of freedom, you may with this word<br>  chain them down to their labor. How did Toussaint succeed?—How did I succeed<br>  before is time in the plain of the Culde-Sac on the plantation Gourand, during<br>  more than eight months after liberty had been granted to the slaves? Let those<br>  who knew me at that time, let the blacks themselves, be asked: they will all<br>  reply that not a single negro upon that plantation, consisting of more than<br>  four hundred and fifty laborers, refused to work: and yet this plantation was<br>  thought to be under the worst discipline and the slaves the most idle of any<br>  in the plain. I inspired the same activity into three other plantations of<br>  which I had the management. I all the negroes had come from Africa within six<br>  months, if they had the love of independence that the Indians have, I should<br>  own that force must be employed; but ninety-nine out of a hundred of the<br>  blacks are aware that without labor they cannot procure the things that are<br>  necessary for them; that there is no other method of satisfying their wants<br>  and their tastes. They know that they must work; the wish to do so, and they<br>  will do so.”<br></p><p>  Such was the conduct of the negroes for the first nine months after their<br>  liberation, or up to the middle of 1794. In the latter part of 1796, Malenfant<br>  says, “The colony was flourishing under Toussaint, the whites lived happily<br>  and in peace upon their estates, and the negroes continued to work for them”<br>  General Lecroix who published his “Memoirs for a history of St. Domingo” in<br>  1819, says that in 1797 the most wonderful progress had been made in<br>  agriculture. “The Colony,” said he, “marched as by enchantment towards its<br>  ancient splendor: cultivation prospered; every day produced perceptible proof<br>  of its progress.” General Vincent, who was a general of brigade of artillery<br>  in St. Domingo and a proprietor of estates in the island, was sent by<br>  Toussaint to Paris in 1801 to lay before the Directory the new constitution<br>  which had been agreed upon in St. Domingo. He arrived in France just at the<br>  moment of the peace of Amiens, and found that Bonaparte was preparing an<br>  armament for the purpose of restoring slavery in St. Domingo. He remonstrated<br>  against the expedition; he stated that it was totally unnecessary and<br>  therefore criminal, for that every thing was going on well in St. Domingo. The<br>  proprietors were in peaceable possessions of their estates; cultivation was<br>  making rapid progress; the blacks were industrious and beyond example happy.<br>  He conjured him, therefore not to reverse this beautiful state of things, but<br>  his efforts were ineffectual, and the expedition arrived upon the shores of<br>  St. Domingo. At length, however, the French were driven from the island. Till<br>  that time the planters had retained their property, and then it was, and not<br>  till then, that they lost their all. In 1804 Dessalines was proclaimed<br>  Emperor; in process of time a great part of the black troops were disbanded,<br>  and returned to cultivation again. From that time to this, there has been no<br>  want o subordination or industry among them.<br></p><p>  The following account of the character and condition of the negroes of Hayti,<br>  at a later period, is taken from “Sketches of Hayti” by Mr. Harvey, who during<br>  the latter part of the reign of Christophe spent a considerable time at Cape<br>  François the capital of his dominions. “The cultivators who formed the great<br>  mass of the population, resided on or near the plantations of which they were<br>  appointed to labor. A great proportion of them were engaged in cultivating the<br>  estates of the king; if soldiers, they were fed and clothed at his expense; if<br>  regular cultivators, they received such a share of the produce as was fully<br>  adequate to yield them a competent maintenance. Others were in the employ of<br>  the nobles and officers, who received either stated wages or such a portion of<br>  the article they cultivated as was deemed a sufficient reward for their<br>  industry, were equally supplied with whatever could contribute to their<br>  comfort. And those who by their exertions and economy were enabled to procure<br>  small spots of land of their own or to hold the smaller plantations at an<br>  annual rent, were diligently engaged in cultivating coffee, sugar, and other<br>  articles, which they disposed of to the inhabitants of the adjacent towns and<br>  villages. It was an interesting sight to behold this class o the Haytians, now<br>  in possession of their freedom, coming in groups to the market nearest which<br>  they resided, bringing the produce of their industry for sale; and afterwards<br>  returning, carrying back the necessary articles of living which the disposal<br>  of their commodities had enabled them to purchase; all evidently cheerful and<br>  happy. Nor could it fail to occur to the mind that their present condition<br>  furnished the most satisfactory answer to that objection to the general<br>  emancipation of slaves, founded on their alleged unfitness to value and<br>  improve the benefits of liberty.<br></p><p>  Though of the same race and possessing the same general traits of character as<br>  the negroes of the other West India islands, they are already distinguished<br>  from them by habits of industry and activity such as slaves are seldom known<br>  to exhibit. As they would not suffer, so they do not require the attendance of<br>  one acting in the capacity of a driver with the instrument of punishment in<br>  his hand.—As far as I had an opportunity of ascertaining from what fell under<br>  my own observation, and from what I gathered from other European residents, I<br>  am persuaded of one general fact which on account of its importance I shall<br>  state in the most explicit terms, viz: that the Haytians employed in<br>  cultivating the plantations, as well as the rest of the population, perform as<br>  much work in a given time as they were accustomed to do during their<br>  subjection to the French. And if we may judge of their future improvement by<br>  the change which has already effected, it may be reasonably anticipated that<br>  Hayti will ere long contain a population not inferior in their industry to<br>  that of any civilized nation in the world.<br></p><p>  While the interior of this island was in this improving state, and its<br>  inhabitants were peaceful and industrious, Cape Francois and other towns<br>  presented scenes of the utmost order and activity: the great majority of the<br>  inhabitants of Cape Francois consisted of trades-people and mechanics, the<br>  former of whom were supplied by the resident merchants with cloths, linens,<br>  silks and other manufactures, which they sold to the natives in small<br>  quantities. Their business was seldom so great as to enable them to amass<br>  fortunes, but it afforded them ample means of support. Towards strangers who<br>  entered their shops, whether for the purpose of making purchases or not, they<br>  were invariably and remarkably civil; a trait in the character of Christophe’s<br>  subjects which I believe to have been universal. The mechanics, though many of<br>  them were deficient in skill from having been imperfectly instructed, were all<br>  enabled by their industry to gain a competent maintenance. On the whole, the<br>  scene which Cape Francois presented was as interesting as it was in many<br>  respects surprising. In few places of commerce could there be seen greater<br>  regularity in the despatch [sic] of business, greater diligence displayed by<br>  those engaged in it, or more evident marks of a prosperous state of things.<br>  Every man had some calling to occupy his attention; instances of idleness or<br>  intemperance were of rare occurrence, the most perfect subordination<br>  prevailed, and all appeared contented and happy. A foreigner would have found<br>  it difficult to persuade himself on his first entering the place, that the<br>  people he now beheld so submissive, industrious and contented, were the same<br>  people who a few years before has escaped from the shackles of slavery.”<br></p><p>  A gentleman who had been for upwards of twenty years past a general merchant<br>  in Hayti, frequently crossing to Europe and America, gave the following<br>  account of the condition of the Haytians to Capt. Stuart at Belfast last<br>  winter. The present population he supposes consists of at least seven hundred<br>  thousand. He said that there was very universal happiness amongst them,—and<br>  that though their conduct was not unexceptionable, yet there was a less<br>  distress, than in any other country of his knowledge. That they obtained<br>  abundance by their own labor.—There were no paupers except the decrepid [sic]<br>  and aged: that the people were very charitable, hospitable and kind, very<br>  respectful to Europeans, temperate, grateful, faithful, orderly and submissive,<br>  easily governable, lively and contented, good mechanics, and that no corporal<br>  punishments are allowed.<br></p>",
    "commentary": "The argument implicit in this account - that once emancipated, people of African descent will behave like Europeans, and even retain a sense of their place in the hierarchic order - was far too common in these early days of Immediate Abolition. This is, to my ears, another misstep along the road to true allyship between white Abolitionists and African-Americans. On a more positive note, the presence of Haiti as a symbol of Black achievement and independence, was always important, as is borne out in the writings of African-Americans like David Walker, Maria Stewart, and Henry Highland Garnet.",

The latter is distinguished for its lofty<br>  spire, four hundred feet; for the purity and uniformity of its architecture,<br>  external and internal; and for the warped condition of the columns of masonry,<br>  which support the tower and spire, under the amazing weight that rests upon<br>  them, and then look us and observe [indecipherable] ready to be crushed. And<br>  the only reason why it is presumed they will remain, is because they have<br>  already endured for ages under the same appearances. An extra fixture has been<br>  thrown in for protection, interposing a monstrous blemish in the perspective<br>  of the transept. Aside from this the pure Gothic of the entire edifice,<br>  constitutes the rarest beauty of the kind in the British Isles. It was built<br>  in the thirteenth century—the spire having been since added, the top of which<br>  inclines 22 inches from a perpendicular line, in consequence of the warping of<br>  its supports. An old man now between seventy and eighty, has been accustomed<br>  to ascend once in a twelve month for many years to oil the weather vane. He<br>  gets out at a window a few feet below the top, scrambles like a squirrel by<br>  some iron net work at the giddy elevation of four hundred feet, performs his<br>  office, and descends with all the self-possession of a sailor. This year,<br>  however, he has been unable to do his duty on account of the infirmities of<br>  age.<br></p><p>  I rode this morning in a fly, a sort of hackney-coach, drawn by a couple of<br>  mules, to<br>  <em>Stonehenge,</em>  about eight miles from the town, situated in the heart of Salisbury plain, and<br>  standing insolated in all the grandeur of its mysterious and hitherto<br>  unexplained history. It is a truly sublime object—sublime in itself, as<br>  filling the mind with wonder, where the stones came from, how they could have<br>  been brought there, and placed in their relative positions! The heaviest<br>  columns are rated at seventy tons—the whole number being ninety-four, as near<br>  as can be ascertained, although the present confusion of the assemblage<br>  renders it difficult to count them. It is supposed to have been a Druidical<br>  temple, where human sacrifices were offered—a superstition as sublime as it<br>  was diabolical, as mysterious as cruel! The rude grandeur of the work<br>  demonstrates the barbarity of the age. There are no indications, that this<br>  place of sacrifice was ever enclosed by walls, or covered by a roof. It is<br>  encircled indeed by the traces of a ditch and a corresponding embankment, and<br>  the columnar ranges of stones were set up in circular lines, at greater<br>  distance from each other than the space occupied. About half an acre is<br>  enclosed by the circumvallation, and a quarter of an acre occupied by the<br>  temple itself. The only junction of the structure if structure it can be<br>  called, appears to have been the resting of the amazing cross and horizontal<br>  slabs on the largest columns, about 20 ft. high &amp; 15 asunder, most of<br>  which have fallen, some are inclined, and a few only standing erect. Tenons<br>  were left on the top of the perpendicular columns, entering grooves of the<br>  horizontal pieces laid upon them. It is barely possible, that the mechanical<br>  powers of the present age could set up an edifice like this; but the rudeness<br>  of the work does not naturally suggest the knowledge and application of such<br>  powers at the time of its creation. Hence the wonder.<br></p><p>  It is said by some, that the same material is not to be found in this island.<br>  It is incredible, however, that these immense rocks should have been shipped;<br>  and almost equally incredible, that they should have been transported any<br>  considerable distance on trundles; and yet they were never found in this<br>  vicinity. Many of them are reduced to nearly right angles, but more exhibit a<br>  smooth, or properly plane surface. There is nothing like the skill of masonry<br>  bestowed upon them. They are perhaps purposely left in this rude state, as<br>  emblematic of the stern and inexorable rites which they were set up to<br>  witness. The supposed altar piece lies in the centre, embedded in the earth,<br>  and directly behind it two of the largest columns supported the heaviest<br>  cross-beam—but the columns have inclined and dropped their burden.<br></p><p>  There are other relics of the kind in the island, but none so stupendous. All<br>  the parts of a similar temple have been transferred at great expense from the<br>  island of Jersey, and set up on the estate of a private gentleman at<br>  Henley-on-Thames, now the property of a Mr. Maitland. I stumbled upon it the<br>  other day in rambling over the grounds with a friend, and found it perched on<br>  a hill some four or five hundred feet above the bed of the Thames. It was<br>  brought over by a former governor of the island, Gen. Conway, who then owned<br>  Park-place, on which it now stands. It is of course a small chapel, compared<br>  with<br>  <em>Stonehenge</em>  on Salisbury Plain—but many of the stones are of several tons weight. They are<br>  rude and shapeless.<br></p><p>  There are numerous marks of ancient military fortifications, scattered over<br>  Salisbury Plain; and tumuli of the ancient dead, such as are to be found in<br>  the Western regions of our own country, lift up their heads in various<br>  quarters, and sometimes in groups.<br></p><p>  Old Sarum, of recent fame, as a rotten borough of England, sending two members<br>  to Parliament under the late<br>  <em>regime</em>  , is a naked fortification in ruins, two miles from Salisbury. It is as<br>  desolate as the crown of Ben Nevis in Scotland.<br></p><p>  My sensations in visiting Stonehenge were the result of a singular combination<br>  of the grateful recollections of Mrs. More’s Shepherd and his family, and of<br>  the actual scenes before me. “The Shepherd of Salisbury Plain” was continually<br>  ringing in my ear, and all his history passing before me, as I rode over these<br>  undulating, naked, and apparently boundless fields, among the tumuli and<br>  traces of ancient fortifications, and came at last to gaze upon and admire<br>  this wonder-exciting and unaccountable relic of a barbarous age and bloody<br>  superstition. What a demonstration of man’s susceptibilities of religious<br>  affections, of a sense of guilt, of his need of atonement, and of the dreadful<br>  errors, into which he may be plunged without the guidance of a divine<br>  revelation!<br></p>",
    "commentary": "While it is interesting that this occupies part of page one, in the very midst of the trial over the Black Law, the discussion about religious sensibilities in this reflective travelogue certainly speaks to the Romantic spirit, and the emergence in New England of Emersonian Transcendentalism at this same time. Hannah More (1745-1833), the author of <em>The Sheperd of Salisbury Plain</em>, was an important female voice on the literature of the time, though not well-known today. ",

It was observed with astonishment, that, when he was a man, and<br>obliged, by the death of his parents, to gain a livelihood by begging through<br>the streets of his native town of Stirling, he knew the whole of the Bible, both<br>Old and New Testaments, by heart! From which you may repeat any passage, and he<br>will tell you the chapter and verse; or you may tell him the chapter and verse,<br>and he will repeat to you the passage, word for word. Not long since, a<br>gentleman, to puzzle him, read, with a slight verbal alteration, a verse of the<br>Bible. Alick hesitated a moment, and then told where it was to be found but said<br>it had not been correctly delivered; he then gave it as it stood in the book,<br>correcting the slight error that had been purposely introduced. The gentleman<br>then asked him for the 90<sup>th</sup>verse of the 7<sup>th</sup>chapter of Numbers. Alick was again puzzled for a moment, but then said hastily,<br>“You are fooling me, sir? there is no such verse—that chapter has only 89<br>verses.” Several other experiments of the sort were tried upon him with the same<br>success. He has often been questioned the day after any particular sermon or<br>speech, and his examiners have invariably found, that, had their patience<br>allowed, blind Alick would have given them the sermon or speech over again.",

He would willingly have advised the pupils of Miss Crandall to have<br>  testified had he not believed that in so doing they voluntarily surrendered<br>  their most sacred rights. True it was, the defendant has kept this<br>  school—‘twas no secret, and whether that constituted a crime or not was for<br>  the jury to determine. In order to convict my client, said Mr.E., you,<br>  gentlemen, must find on your oaths that she has committed a crime. You may<br>  find that she has violated an act of the State legislature, but if you also<br>  find her protected by a higher power, it will be your duty to acquit. The<br>  court he was fully assured, would charge the jury that the law was<br>  unconstitutional, I they so believed, but after all, it belonged to the people<br>  to determine whether one of them had been guilty of a crime. Each one of the<br>  jury must be satisfied for himself alone, that a crime has been committed. He<br>  flattered himself that he should be able to lead them to the conclusion that<br>  the law in question was a violation of the constitution of this State and of<br>  the United States.—The constitution of the United States was the highest power<br>  known in our land. Beyond that, no Legislature can go, and if the jury find<br>  the law not to stand well with the constitution they must say so.<br></p><p>  The real question for the jury to settle Mr Ellsworth apprehended to be this:<br>  Can the Legislature of Connecticut pass a law prohibiting the citizens of<br>  other States from coming into this State, and there residing, to prosecute the<br>  acquisition of knowledge, in a way open to the citizens of this State. This he<br>  believed was the precise question, and it reached deep and wide—wider and<br>  deeper than was perhaps imagined. It was however claimed by his friend from<br>  Canterbury, that colored persons were not citizens, and that the provisions of<br>  the constitution, with respect to citizens of the United States, did not apply<br>  to this class of our population. The criterion of citizenship was complexion,<br>  in the view of the gentleman who had preceded him. I, said Mr E., make the<br>  criterion to be either birth or naturalization. Admitting that none but white<br>  persons can be naturalized, it does not touch the question of citizenship by<br>  birth. Is it so that a person born on our soil, is not a citizen of our soil?<br>  In the days of Revolution, said Mr E., these men fought side by side with our<br>  fathers, and shed their blood for this country, which as their country—the<br>  country to which they owed indefeasible allegiance. Their names were no<br>  inscribed on the Pension Rolls of the Government—they now received the<br>  honorable trophies of the services they had rendered. Where, said Mr E., does<br>  the gentleman get the doctrine that the rights of man, as a citizen, depend<br>  upon his color? A colored man could appeal to the laws for the protection of<br>  his rights in every State; could he, if he were not a citizen? (Mr. E. here<br>  read a few sentences from the commencement of the declaration of independence,<br>  which, he said, according to the argument of the gentleman opposed to him,<br>  ought to be changed so as to have the words “except black people” introduced<br>  between each clause). Mr E. said he was a republican, he claimed to be as much<br>  of a republican as his friend from Canterbury, and he hoped that his friend<br>  was not so ashamed of his republicanism, as to wish this instrument, the<br>  Declaration of Independence, interpolated in this manner. Our own<br>  constitution, continued Mr E., recognized, in express terms, equality of<br>  rights—that men were equal in rights, but to this the gentleman would add<br>  “except black men.” He hoped he should not live long enough to see such<br>  doctrine go forth from Connecticut. The free colored population has, and is<br>  justly entitled, to equal representation in the Congress of the United States<br>  with the white population. Could not a black man commit treason? The gentleman<br>  would have it that he could not, for none other than citizens can. Mr E. here<br>  read from the 2d Kent’s Com. on the subject of citizenship, by birth.) I scout<br>  the Idea, said Mr E., that a man, born here by the side of me, is not a<br>  citizen because, his father was black, while I am a citizen because mine was<br>  white.<br></p><p>  Mr E. said that the argument which his friend had drawn from the fact that our<br>  state constitution provided that none but white citizens should become<br>  electors, would seem to be based on the assumption that the right of voting<br>  was a criterion of citizenship. Is this, he asked, the fact? Was the right of<br>  voting a test of citizenship? If it is, where are our wives and daughters?<br>  Citizens, or not? Would the gentleman denationalize them? How could persons<br>  born here be aliens? Mr E. then proceeded to examine more minutely the<br>  abstract question which he had before stated. It was, he said, a great<br>  question, one which he had not doubt would make a figure in the future history<br>  of this country. If, said Mr E., resident citizens of this state may choose<br>  their own instructors, then, he believe, that citizens from other states, here<br>  by their sides, may also choose theirs. If the Legislature of Connecticut can<br>  say to a black citizen of New York that he shall not come here to be<br>  instructed he may say so to the white citizen. Where is the distinction? It<br>  comes then to this, our Legislature can say as to the population of an<br>  adjacent state, for instance New York, it is corrupt, and its citizens shall<br>  not come within our limits—be they white or black it makes no difference. A<br>  barrier was thus at once erected around our state. An absurdity so manifest as<br>  this must strike every mind. Nothing but a high state of excitement could ever<br>  have caused the enactment of such a law as the present. The citizens of<br>  Canterbury he had no doubt, would, on reflection, perceive the impropriety of<br>  their course. The care and supervision which the Legislature had exercised<br>  over schools in this state did not, as Mr E. apprehended imply the right to<br>  exercise any such power as that set up in the new law.<br></p><p>  The law, which regulate trades and professions, to which allusion has been<br>  made, were also, he said, of an entirely different character. These<br>  regulations and restrictions, it must be remembered, were the same for all.<br>  Whether one belonged to the state or not, these laws knew no difference. The<br>  new law has made a difference, and in that consisted the difficulty. The<br>  application of the new law must depend upon the fact whether a person was born<br>  in or out of the state. The Legislature leave the black man born here, the<br>  freedom of selecting his own instructor, and the place of instruction for his<br>  child. This privilege is denied to the black man who comes here, if it so<br>  happens that he was born out of the state. But, says the gentleman, his<br>  children may go to the district schools, to any of the high schools of<br>  academies in the state. The benefits which colored children would derive from<br>  these schools, said Mr E. would not be worth a pinch of snuff, and the<br>  gentleman knows it.—The blacks in Hartford had petitioned for a separate<br>  school, in order that they might have the benefit of the public money, which<br>  they did not enjoy now, as they were ever made hewers of wood and drawers of<br>  water, and considered the offscouring of the schools which they attended. They<br>  made commotion in every school the moment they entered it. There existed then<br>  a necessity for separate schools.—He was not going abreast of any principle of<br>  supervision which the state could properly exercise over schools, or over<br>  trades and professions, by contending for the rights of citizens to choose<br>  their own instructors, and the place of instruction, for their children,<br>  whether they were or were not citizens of this state. The old statute in<br>  relation to paupers was considered as upholding this law. By it, persons<br>  liable to become chargeable might be warned to depart, and might be publicly<br>  whipped if they did not obey the mandate. He would here thank his friend from<br>  Canterbury for obtaining a repeal of that portion of the law by which whipping<br>  was imposed. Mr E. apprehended that a state possessed the power of preventing<br>  the settlement, within its limits, of those likely to become paupers, but that<br>  the state had the power of keeping out very body from other states, he denied<br>  altogether. Will it be said that the law in question does not go this extent?<br>  If a citizen of Massachusetts may come into this state and settle down, what<br>  is he here for? Must he be a drone? What is the privilege of moving worth to<br>  him? Citizens of other states may come here and become farmers, or lawyers,<br>  (that would be a poor business, said Mr E.) or doctors. They may, when here,<br>  said Mr E. do what citizens here may do, or the constitution is not worth a<br>  rush. ‘Twas claimed that blacks might come here and go to other schools. Might<br>  not the Legislature then say to them, and to all others, you shall send your<br>  children to the Presbyterian school—to the Baptist school, or to the Methodist<br>  school? Might not the Legislature further say, we do not like Roman Catholics,<br>  and we will therefore have no school where Catholics instruct? Gentlemen must<br>  go this length, who advocate this law. Would it be claimed that the fact of<br>  putting this power in the hands of the select men to exercise, made any<br>  difference? This was a mere parade of liberality—the select men of Canterbury<br>  would sooner shed their blood than grant Miss Crandall permission to keep this<br>  school. The power to license, said Mr E., is a power to deny—and we are to<br>  hold our most sacred rights and privileges at the pleasure of the select men;<br>  they can grant or they can prohibit.<br></p><p>  Mr E. now proceeded to consider the rights which citizens of each state are<br>  entitled to enjoy in the several states. He read from the opinion of Judge<br>  Washington, as reported in the 4<sup>th</sup>  of Washington’s Circuit Court Reps. page 380, which he claimed showed<br>  conclusively that the new law of Connecticut was unconstitutional. He also<br>  maintained that the views he took of this law were supported by Judge Story,<br>  in the third volume of his recent work on the Constitution and also in<br>  Sergeant’s Constitutional law, page 385. The legislation of Congress on the<br>  subject of the Missouri question, he claimed distinctly recognized blacks as<br>  Citizens. The law when it says that no person shall keep a school for the<br>  instruction of blacks from abroad, says, in effect, that no foreign person<br>  shall come here and be taught—How were they to be taught without a teacher?<br>  This law would extinguish the light of knowledge—would degrade those who are<br>  now degraded, and depress those who are now depressed. It said to the naked,<br>  go unclothed, and to the hungry, go unfed. The distinctions which now existed<br>  on account of color were sufficiently great—the colored people had now<br>  difficulties enough to struggle with—he hoped they would not be increased.<br></p><p>  The general policy of this law, continued Mr E., and its connexion with the<br>  subject of slavery, though a question touching deep feelings, cannot, without<br>  impropriety, be discussed here. Had he been a member of the legislature that<br>  enacted it, he might have said something on the subject, but should refrain<br>  from it on the present occasion.<br></p><p>  In conclusion, Mr. Ellsworth thanked the jury for the attention they had paid<br>  to his remarks, which, he said, were quite unsatisfactory to himself. He hoped<br>  they would see their way clear, before they found his client guilty of a crime<br>  for endeavoring to elevate and enlighten an unfortunate portion of our race.<br>  Were they prepared to say that teaching the word of God was a crime? That it<br>  was a crime to teach children the Bible? He left the case with them. He<br>  trusted that the court would tell them that the law was unconstitutional, but<br>  if they should not, my appeal, said Mr E., is to THE PEOPLE, and to THE PEOPLE<br>  I leave my client.<br></p><p>  Mr. Strong said that after the very full, and eloquent, and conclusive<br>  argument of his brother Ellsworth, it would be more grateful to his feelings to<br>  leave the case in the hands of the jury without adding a word. He feared that<br>  he should rather diminish than add to the force of that argument. He however<br>  found an apology for occupying a short time, in the magnitude of the<br>  case under consideration. It involves the liberties of the people.<br></p><p>  Those who advocate the cause of the defendant, said Mr. S., are charged with<br>  endeavoring to nullify the laws. What is nullification? An attempt by the<br>  Legislature of a state, to destroy a power higher than itself. South Carolina<br>  had done this to the fullest extent—our own state had made some progress, but<br>  the right of trial by jury was still left us. A culprit is here arraigned—a<br>  female—by the courtesy of the court she had not been called upon to hold up<br>  her hand, and plead to the information against her, but she nevertheless stood<br>  there as a criminal. She was charged with giving instruction, but there was no<br>  pretence that she has inculcated bad principles. He had heard of a land where<br>  this might be criminal, but it was a land where despots reigned. Her crime<br>  consisted in this, that she had given light to those who were in mental<br>  darkness—had taught those who were ignorant, to read the bible. It was true<br>  that the persons to whom she had given instruction were descendants of that<br>  unfortunate race, who were even in a state of slavery in this country. He said<br>  this not to their reproach, but to our own. He rejoiced that public sentiment<br>  had changed on the subject—but one feeling now exists &amp; that was not<br>  peculiar to our own country. The Legislature of Great Britain was engaged in<br>  passing a law of a very different character from the one now in question, at<br>  the very time that our Legislature passed this. Even in a country where a king<br>  and nobles constituted one branch of the legislature, a law had been passed,<br>  almost simultaneously with our own, strikingly dissimilar in its provisions.<br>  We complained that this class of persons were low, degraded, and addicted to<br>  crime. Has God made them so, or have they been made so by ignorance? ‘Twas a<br>  little boon to give them liberty, and keep them in ignorance. Better to rivet<br>  the chains of slavery, then to break those and rivet again the chains of<br>  ignorance. But one sentiment now pervaded the people of this country, with<br>  respect to educating these people—there was a difference as to the way. Some<br>  were for colonizing them, others had different views, but all agreed they<br>  ought to be instructed in some way. If they were carried out of the country in<br>  ignorance, was it not carrying them away that they might destroy themselves.<br>  Unless education accompanied them all was in vain. What, asked Mr. S., has<br>  been the course pursued by the defendant? He rejoiced that her pupils had been<br>  before the jury, and that they had had opportunities of seeing them. Were they<br>  not worthy of being instructed? Had not the defendant entirely deferred to<br>  public sentiment, in relation to keeping the races separate? What more<br>  feasible course for educating these people could be point out, than the one<br>  she had adopted? The colored race could not educate themselves—unless some<br>  person would step forward and overcome these prejudices, whether rightful or<br>  not, he should not decide, they must ever live in ignorance.<br></p><p>MR. STRONG, next proceeded to remark on the law.</p><p>  He read the preamble and said it put him in mind of the painter, who affixed a<br>  label to his pictures, lest the spectators might not otherwise be able to<br>  determine what animal he intended to delineate. The question, continued Mr S.,<br>  is often asked, :would you be willing to have a school of this description in<br>  your own neighborhood?” What if we should not, could we put it down by passing<br>  an unconstitutional law? What if I did not wish my neighbor to keep a large<br>  number of dogs, could I of course compel him to put them away? This law does<br>  not prevent colored persons from coming to this State. They may come and be<br>  idle, and welcome—they may come for any earthly purpose except education. That<br>  they are told they must get in the district schools. In these schools, the<br>  colored class sit on the lowest bench. They cannot go to these schools—as soon<br>  as their minds become a little expanded, they must retire from them. He wished<br>  to have an instance pointed out where any black had continued to attend, for<br>  any length of time, and derived benefit. It was impossible that such should be<br>  the case as things now were. What they desired was a school by themselves,<br>  where, and only where, they could acquire an education. They asked of us<br>  bread, but we gave them a stone—they asked a fish, but we gave them a<br>  scorpion—there was the sting of reproach in it. We place our foot on the<br>  black, and hold him down in the dust, and then complain that he does not grow<br>  to the perfect stature of a man. There was but one Academy in the State where<br>  they could be admitted at all, and this was by the munificence of a private<br>  individual—he alluded to the late Mr Bacon of Colchester. He should have<br>  supposed by the argument of the gentleman who opened the case for the<br>  prosecution, that the new act would open the doors [of] every academy and<br>  college in the State. The proviso in the law amounted to nothing—it might as<br>  well have provided that nothing in that act should be construed to prevent<br>  colored persons from holding all the Bank stock in the State. The act exposed<br>  one to penalties who should instruct a colored person, from another State, in<br>  a sabbath school. It compelled us to obtain a license to seek out the poor,<br>  the ignorant, the destitute, and the benighted.<br></p><p>  It is claimed, said Mr S., that the legislature have the power to regulate<br>  schools—be it so. He asked however to be pointed to an instance where the<br>  regulation depended on the character of the scholar. This law excluded those<br>  whom it pronounced bad. He would say, let all be instructed, particularly the<br>  bad that they might be made better. He spoke however with confidence, when he<br>  said, that no law had ever existed, in this State, to regulate private school.<br>  (Mr S. then read from some of the ancient statutes, regulating schools,<br>  appointing inspectors, &amp;c.) The legislature, continued Mr S., regulated<br>  these schools because they had established them, and they undoubtedly might do<br>  so. Was this power claimed in order to prevent bad principles from being<br>  taught? He did not perceive that the defendant had offended in this respect.<br>  There was nothing had in teaching arithmetic, geography, grammar, and the<br>  bible. If this however was the object of the law, whom did it protect? Our own<br>  citizens? No—we might teach them every thing naughty that we chose, but were<br>  restrained from doing so to those who came from abroad. This, said Mr S., is<br>  really the most<br>  <em>diffusive</em>  kind of benevolence I ever heard of. Most of our criminal laws, continued Mr<br>  S., gives the court some discretionary power in imposing punishment, in this<br>  law the penalty is fixed, if the law itself be not fixed—if it be not pierced<br>  by the spear which emanated from the constitution. All public officers are<br>  sworn to support the constitution of the United States, and if any law<br>  interferes with that, it must be disregarded—otherwise they would incur the<br>  guilt of perjury. Whether any of the jury had taken this oath, he knew not,<br>  nor was it material to his argument. The Constitution of the United States was<br>  the supreme law, and must be regarded by all citizens, whether public officers<br>  or not. He meant to speak with all respect of the opinion of the Court, and<br>  though in civil matters the jury were bound to take the law as given from the<br>  Bench, it was otherwise in criminal questions. Here the Court advise, and the<br>  jury decide.<br></p><p>  He intended no disrespect to the legislature which enacted this law, by the<br>  animadversions which he made concerning it. It was notorious that public<br>  feeling frequently exercised a strong influence in regard to the passage of<br>  laws. As an instance of this, he would refer to a law passed a few years since<br>  in this State, called the Steam-boat law. In this law, we cut off many of our<br>  privileges for the sake of retaliating on the State of New-York. The law was<br>  passed by acclamation. Gov. Wolcott sent a sensible well written message to<br>  the legislature, suggesting its impolicy and unconstitutionality, but it was<br>  no more regarded than if he had sent a page of the spelling book—it did not<br>  change a vote. The Dartmouth College case was another instance of the passage<br>  of a State law, in time of high excitement. Again and again had our sacred<br>  constitution been called to exert its conservative principle.<br></p><p>  Mr S. said that it was with some surprise that he had listened to the<br>  statement of the opening Counsel for the prosecution, as to the law of<br>  Pennsylvania, relating to the residence of blacks in their limits. What the<br>  gentleman asserted to be the law of that State, which he had so properly<br>  styled “the land of Penn,” was a bill reported to the legislature, but never<br>  passed into a law. Other bills had been framed and prepared to pass, in other<br>  legislatures, which Mr S. apprehended would form a miscellaneous collection.<br>  It would greatly gratify his curiosity, could he get a sight of some of them.<br>  It was no reflection on the character of our State, that under excitement, it<br>  had passed an unconstitutional law—other States had done the same. Mr S. here<br>  referred to the second section of the 4<sup>th</sup>  Article of the constitution, on which he said he relied to prove the<br>  unconstitutionality of the law. He also read from the articles o<br>  confederation, which he claimed to contain a similar provision. By the<br>  adoption of the constitution, we were, said Mr S., made one people. ‘Twas<br>  necessary—‘twas the principle of the proclamation of Gen. Jackson, so<br>  deservedly popular throughout this section of the Country. If this principle<br>  was impugned, it destroyed that which alone made our government worth<br>  anything. (Mr. S. also read from Judge Story what had before been quoted by Mr<br>  Ellsworth) In ancient times, continued Mr S., it was a proud boast—“I am a<br>  Roman citizen.” A citizen of the United States was entitled to one no less<br>  proud—I am an American citizen. We were not to say that we were citizens of<br>  Connecticut, but that we were American citizens. A portion of our country men<br>  might wish to raise the Palmetto banner, but the eagle and the stripes were<br>  our badge. The attorney for the prosecution would improve upon the<br>  Nullification of South Carolina. That State had only to pass an act excluding<br>  the standing army o the United States from her territory, and the principles<br>  of the old General’s proclamation were all nullified, or Mr S. was greatly<br>  mistaken. Were blacks citizens? The term “citizen” was to have a technical<br>  sense. He had listened with pleasure to this remark from the gentleman who<br>  opened the case, for when a word has a technical signification, it was always<br>  easy to get its precise meaning. All the technics however which seemed to<br>  attach to the word were that a citizen must not be colored. If colored persons<br>  were not citizens, Mr S. claimed that they were not inhabitants, which<br>  conclusion was manifestly absurd. Color had no connection with the question of<br>  citizenship be birth, though it had in respect to naturalization. In deference<br>  to southern views, the Militia laws of the nation, passed in 1792, did not<br>  include colored persons—the words were, “every free white male citizen”—was<br>  not this an express recognition that persons other than whites were citizens?<br>  If “citizens” meant a white person only, why was this language used? (Mr S.<br>  here read from Ingersoll’s digest 745, relative to the protections granted to<br>  American seamen, which, he said were always given to blacks as well as<br>  whites.) The war of 1812 was caused, continued Mr S., in no small degree, by<br>  the impressment of our seamen who had these protections in their pockets. Our<br>  government considered the impressment of blacks who had these protections, as<br>  standing on the same ground with the impressment of the whites, and the war<br>  was declared and fought as much on their account as on account of the whites.<br>  The law in relation to American shipping required that in order to be entitled<br>  to discriminating duties at the custom house, it must be owned in whole or in<br>  part, by American Citizens. Colored persons frequently owned ships which were<br>  uniformly regarded as the property of American citizens.<br></p><p>Mr S. named Paul Cuffee as an instance.</p><p>  The courts of the United States were open to citizens and also to<br>  aliens—aliens, however, must describe themselves as such, on order to maintain<br>  an action. The uniform practice was for blacks to sue as citizens, never as<br>  aliens. Mr S. here read from Kent’s Com. and claimed from the doctrine there<br>  advanced that a black might go from one State to another, and enjoy in that<br>  other, the same privileges that a person of the same class enjoyed who<br>  belonged to that other State, I do not claim, said Mr S., that a citizen of an<br>  other State coming into this State, brings all privileges with him which he<br>  before enjoyed—he brings with him however the character of a citizen of the<br>  United States, and that entitles him to enjoy here, the same privileges with<br>  our citizens under circumstances similar to his own.<br></p><p>  Gen. Jackson, said Mr S., in his proclamation at New Orleans, addressed the<br>  blacks as “fellow citizens.” Did he mean to insult them? No, he meant to<br>  recognize them as citizens and the law so recognized them. They could purchase<br>  and hold real estate, could gain a settlement, and could, in fact, do what<br>  citizen[s] could, and what aliens could not do. It would be an insult to talk<br>  of naturalizing a man born here. The constitution of our State had been<br>  alluded to, in order to prove that blacks were not citizens, because it did<br>  not allow them to vote. Voting was not test of citizenship. If it was then by<br>  the showing of the gentleman, blacks were citizens, for in New York they were<br>  allowed to vote, and were therefore, according to the gentleman, citizens of<br>  the United States in New York; of course they were citizens here.<br></p><p>  Mr Strong here replied to the arguments which had been drawn from the course<br>  of legislation pursued by other States in respect to the blacks—the law of<br>  Ohio, &amp;c. He read the law of Louisiana, which affixed a penalty of $500 or<br>  the first offence of instruct[ing] a black in the Sabbath Schools, death for<br>  the second. The jury, he said, were not to regard the laws of other States as<br>  necessarily giving the true construction to the Constitution.—These laws, if<br>  unconstitutional, did not support our law, and it was their province to decide<br>  their constitutionality. He also referred to a late opinion of Judge Baldwin,<br>  given in the Circuit Court of the United States, and also to the opinion of<br>  Judge Washington before referred to, with respect to the rights of citizens of<br>  the U. States in the several states.<br></p><p>  Our ancient law, said Mr. S., which allowed persons to be carried out of the<br>  State, who were not citizens, was restrained from operating on apprentices,<br>  because they came for the acquisition of knowledge.—While minors were<br>  prevented from contracting for any thing but necessaries, they were allowed in<br>  express terms, to contract for the purpose of education.—Was education, he<br>  asked, a fundamental right? Ferdinand of Spain, he presumed did not believe<br>  that it was, neither did that king who was now chased through Portugal—and<br>  why? because education was the basis of liberty. Should such however be the<br>  doctrine of this free land? If our law had said that blacks in this state<br>  should not be educated at all, though inhuman and unchristian, it would not be<br>  liable to the same objections that it now is. The case seemed to him as plain<br>  as any he had ever submitted to a jury. The conclusion followed on the heel of<br>  the premises. If a school was opened to blacks who belonged to this state, it<br>  was certain it must be open to those who came from other states, under the<br>  same circumstances, for by the Constitution of the United States, they were<br>  entitled to a community of rights.<br></p><p>  As it regarded the license, which, under this law, might be obtained of the<br>  select men and civil authority, ‘twas nothing at all—it would not be given,<br>  but, if it would, we were not bound to ask it. As well might we be told that<br>  we should not eat without their permission. That would merely starve the<br>  body—this starved the mind—it kept on husks that which confer on man his<br>  immortality.<br></p><p>  It was claimed that we had other laws of a similar character. ‘Twas no<br>  matter—it made this law no better—doing wrong once was no apology for doing it<br>  again, much less did it create a right to do it. Make the law equal as to its<br>  application and he would find no fault.<br></p><p>  He took the case of Eliza Glasko—she was an inhabitant of the state, and Ann<br>  Eliza Hammond was not. What difference could the Legislature make in relation<br>  to these persons as to the right to attend what school they chose? As to the<br>  law requiring citizens of other states to give bonds before they could<br>  maintain an action in our Courts, it operated equally—citizens of our state,<br>  if they resided out, were subject to the law—it depended simply on residence.<br>  The law providing against the settlement of paupers would not sustain this<br>  law. That required bonds for the support of those likely to become chargeable.<br>  Bonds were not sought here, except the bonds which tie the mind, and fetter<br>  the man—not bonds of security, but bonds of vassalage. It cannot, said Mr S.<br>  be sustained. The people would not endure the alien law of ‘98—‘twas abhorrent<br>  to the principles of our government, and drove from power the man that made<br>  it. This law has features even more odious than that. The people will not and<br>  ought not to endure it. By sanctioning this law, he said the jury would<br>  sanction a principle which would prevent them or their sons from emigrating to<br>  the western states.<br></p><p>  He trusted he need spend no more time—he believed they would do their duty. He<br>  should ask the court to charge them that the law was obnoxious to the charges<br>  he has made against it, but should the court do otherwise, his appeal was to<br>  them. It was their prerogative to pass upon this law which owed its creation<br>  to an excited state of feeling. To them he looked for a verdict which would<br>  maintain civil liberty.<br></p><p>  Mr WELCH regretted the duty that had devolved upon him his state of health,*<br>  and his recent connexion with the case, would, he said, perhaps prevent him<br>  from doing to the case even that justice case which might have been in his<br>  power to do under other circumstances. Besides the eloquence and ingenuity of<br>  the defendant’s counsel might have diverted the mind of the jury from the real<br>  issue. He should discharge his duty without personal feeling. If he had before<br>  harbored any, he should strive to banish it from his mind now. He wished the<br>  right of the state of Connecticut to be fairly, impartially, and<br>  dispassionately examined. The government asked no conviction but upon<br>  principles which could be consistently reconciled with justice and the<br>  constitution. The fact that the defendant was a female had been alluded to,<br>  but this altered not her rights. She had the same and none other rights, than<br>  every citizen. Her hoped the jury would not be misled by the impassioned<br>  flashes of eloquence which they had heard from her counsel. He would have them<br>  pause and examine. The rights of the judge and the beggar were the same at the<br>  bar of justice. Rights there, were common, but artificial rights in society<br>  were different. The rights of citizens had been pressed upon their<br>  attention—the rights of states must not be forgotten.<br></p><p>  Was the law Constitutional? Possibly it was not. Laws has been passed which<br>  undoubtedly were unconstitutional, and if this was, he asked no conviction<br>  under it. They had but one course to pursue. If the law was contrary to the<br>  constitution they were bound to acquit—no one, if such was the character of<br>  the law, would acquiesce in the decision more cheerfully than himself. The<br>  gentlemen opposed to him has said, very emphatically, that they appealed to<br>  the people if the court decided the law to be constitutional. The jury, he<br>  said, were the people. It was no doubt true that in criminal cases the jury<br>  could decide the in spite of the court, but, was it enviable? Would they<br>  desire to do it? Rights were at stake, the rights of the state as well as the<br>  rights of the party.—He would have the jury look at the result of their<br>  verdict as it respected the effects it would have on these rights. They might<br>  take the law into their own hands and acquit the defendant. They sacrificed<br>  the rights of the state beyond remedy by doing so—their verdict against the<br>  state was final. If, however, they found a verdict against the defendant, it<br>  had no such effect on her. The case could be carried to another tribunal where<br>  she could have perfect justice, and where her rights would not be at all<br>  prejudiced by a conviction here. ‘Twas no hardship to her, and a contrary<br>  course might do an irremediable wrong to the state.<br></p><p>  They had been told that they had, that day, to decide a great question—an<br>  exciting one. It was true. Why then had they been called so loudly to take the<br>  case from the court? If they decided the law to be unconstitutional ‘twould be<br>  no evidence except between the same parties as a matter of fact. Another jury<br>  might decide the law to be constitutional, and this what was a crime at one<br>  time would be no crime at another, though tried under the same law. He had no<br>  idea that they had any motive but to discharge impartially their duties as<br>  jurors.<br></p><p>  Mr W. said, that as the defendant, by her plea, had put all the facts<br>  necessary to her conviction in issue, he should now examine the proof. The<br>  counsel for the defence had seemed tacitly to admit the facts charged to be<br>  true, but as he did not mean to desert any part of the case which the<br>  gentlemen opposed to him had not distinctly admitted to be in favor of the<br>  prosecution, he should recapitulate the evidence, and see if a case had been<br>  made out. (Mr W. here examined the testimony, commented upon it at length, and<br>  claimed that it was perfectly conclusive.)<br></p><p>  The gentlemen who had argued for the defence, said Mr W., never meant to make<br>  the constitutionality of this law a point in the case. They thought they had<br>  thrown a barrier around their client by closing the mouths of witnesses. It<br>  was the object of the gentlemen to go out of court in triumph for want of<br>  proof to convict, but the grating doors of a certain building, though it did<br>  not unstop deaf ears, did open dumb mouths. The witnesses then spoke,<br>  notwithstanding the gentlemen had hoped to apply to them the gag law. Their<br>  efforts had proved ineffectual—their flag was furled, and when he saw the<br>  quivering step of a retreating army he believed that they anticipated defeat.<br></p><p>  Mr W. rejoiced that a spirit was going abroad to improve the colored race.<br>  ‘Twas one thing however to produce a reformation by proper and legal means and<br>  another by improper and illegal ones. He would refrain no longer from<br>  considering the constitutional question in the case. The law was called<br>  unconstitutional because it was said to prohibit free persons of color from<br>  coming into this state, from other states, to be educated. Mr W. said that he<br>  knew no better way of testing constitutionality of a law, than a comparison of<br>  the law with the provisions of the constitution. Whenever they came in<br>  collision, it was easy to decide which must stand.—By this test then, by a<br>  comparison of the letter of the law with the letter of the constitution, he<br>  perceived no discrepancy. (Mr W. here read the second section of the fourth<br>  article of the constitution and then read the law.) Now, continued Mr W. this<br>  law does not prohibit any one from coming here for any purpose, if permission<br>  be obtained. If it is on the prohibition that gentlemen claim the law to be<br>  unconstitutional. But if permission be granted in all cases when asked, as<br>  possibly it may be, where is the unconstitutionality of the law? The gentlemen<br>  claim that it is prohibitory and therefore unconstitutional—it may never be<br>  prohibitory; how then is it unconstitutional? In order, gentlemen, said Mr W.,<br>  to determine that this law is unconstitutional, you must look through the<br>  vista of coming time, and with a keen prophetic vision, foresee that the civil<br>  authority will never grant their license. You must settle a question of face<br>  which you cannot settle. If you can find this fact, put it in your<br>  verdict—render this libel on your understandings along with it—such a<br>  principle as this ought not to be contended for—the tears of contrition should<br>  blot it out, and the blush of shame should light a fire to consume it.<br></p><p>  In respect to the meaning of the term “citizen” in the constitution, Mr. W.<br>  claimed that the ground taken by Mr. Judson, in opening the case, was<br>  tenable—that the term was used in a technical sense. He denied that it meant<br>  all persons who lived and moved within certain limits, as he understood the<br>  gentleman to claim. (Mr. W. here read from the articles of confederation, to<br>  support his construction of the term “citizen.”) He said that his brother<br>  Strong had read this quotation of a long trot, as though he feared the jury<br>  would understand it, and perceive the fallacy of his argument. Mr W. claimed<br>  that there was a distinction between the term “people” or “inhabitants,” in<br>  the article of confederation, and the term “citizens” in the constitution. He<br>  also read from Dr. Webster’s dictionary the definition of “citizen,” and<br>  insisted that blacks do not come within it.—Mr. W. also read and commented on<br>  the subject of naturalization, and claimed that Congress had never treated<br>  blacks as capable of becoming citizens. It was not the policy of the<br>  government. The Missouri question had been alluded to, but the whole of it was<br>  one continued act of political juggling—he should not think of appealing to it<br>  as authority for any thing.<br></p><p>  Mr. W. said that he derived a strong argument in construction which he gave<br>  the constitution from the usages and legislation of other states. He then went<br>  on to remark at length upon the statutes of many of the states, in relation to<br>  the black population. If blacks were citizens he said the legislatures of many<br>  of the states must be called worse than Turkish tyrants—He dwelt with much<br>  emphasis and ability on the laws of Massachusetts and Rhode Island,<br>  prohibiting the intermarriage of whites and blacks. These laws said Mr. W.,<br>  could only be reconciled with the constitution on the ground that blacks were<br>  not citizens. The right of education had been called a fundamental right. He<br>  was not disposed to contest the truth of this position. The right of selecting<br>  the partner of one’s joys and sorrows was however a right no less dear, no<br>  less sacred, than the right of selecting those whom we will have to educate<br>  our children. If our law was unconstitutional it was clear that all these laws<br>  to which he had alluded were also unconstitutional. He did not believe they<br>  were—the fact that they had been acquiesced I so long was evidence conclusive<br>  to his mind that they were not.<br></p><p>  The case had been so fully gone into by his associate who opened the case,<br>  that he would not detain the jury longer. He put the rights of the state into<br>  their hands, and also the rights of the defendant, under direction of the<br>  court as to the law. They were not to inquire whether their verdict would<br>  advance the power of one party of another—whether it would feed or allay the<br>  excitement which existed. They should forget all that did not legitimately<br>  belong to the case—even the eloquence of the gentleman wo had argued for the<br>  defence should be forgotten, so far as it was not relevant. Duties were<br>  theirs—consequences devolved elsewhere.<br></p><p>His Honor Judge EATON then charged the jury in substance as follows.</p><p><em>Gentlemen of the Jury:</em></p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prudence<br>  Crandall is charged in the information before you, with a violation of a<br>  certain statute law of this state, forbidding the setting up of a school for<br>  the instruction of colored persons, not inhabitants of this state, or boarding<br>  or harboring them for the purpose of instruction. Provided the acts charged<br>  are proved to be done, the day is not material, if since the passage of the<br>  law, and before the filing of the information. Neither are the names nor the<br>  number of the persons instructed material. The facts must be proved to your<br>  satisfaction, gentlemen, and whether they are so or not you are the sole<br>  judges—it is not the duty of the court even to advise in relation to the<br>  measure of proof.<br></p><p>  As to the law of the case, this also belongs to you to decide, but the Court<br>  has a duty to perform with regard to it. That duty is, to advise you as to its<br>  validity and constitutionality. It has been claimed at the Bar that the law is<br>  unconstitutional, and that the state legislature had no power to pass it. It<br>  is gratifying to the court, gentlemen, that its opinion is not final—that it<br>  can be revised by a higher tribunal, and corrected if erroneous. The opinion<br>  of the Court is, that the law is constitutional and obligatory on the people<br>  of this state.—You will take the case into consideration, gentlemen, and<br>  render a verdict of guilty or not guilty, as to you shall seem just and<br>  proper.<br></p><p>  The jury retired, and after an absence of several hours, returned into Court<br>  not having agreed on a verdict. They were again ordered out, and again<br>  returned not having agreed. The third time they stated to the court that there<br>  was no probability that they should ever agree. The court then discharged<br>  them. This operates as a continuance of the case to the next term of the<br>  County Court to be holden on the second Tuesday of December<br>  next.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>  F.<br></p>",

    "transcription": "<p align=\"right\">FOR THE UNIONIST.</p><p>  Mr. Editor. It is truly astonishing to witness the efforts at<br>  misrepresentation in the last Advertiser respecting Miss Crandall’s trial.—It<br>  is the part of wisdom in the many correspondents to that paper that they have<br>  not signed their names to the articles communicated. An article appears headed<br>  this, “Effects of abolition principles in a Court of Justice.” The writer<br>  attempts, in his way, to question the veracity of persons who were called upon<br>  to testify, when they said that they had drank tea with Miss Crandall and her<br>  scholars but could not recollect the countenances of any who were then in<br>  court. From this circumstance the writer wishes to convey the idea to his<br>  readers that they were guilty of swearing falsely, and thus were it in his<br>  power, would he fix upon them the seal of infamy. The writer of that article<br>  should know, that however much honorable men may differ from him in sentiment,<br>  merely a difference of opinion does not render them incapable of speaking the<br>  truth, and whenever he touches upon an honorable man’s character, he touches a<br>  very tender spot. However lightly he may regard it,—character, in the<br>  estimation of some men—some abolitionists we trust—ay, even some who have had<br>  the hardihood to<br>  <em>sit at the same table</em>  with Miss Crandall and her colored misses—is above all price. The writer<br>  thinks it is a most incredible circumstance that a person could drink tea with<br>  20 misses whom he never saw before, and 2 or 3 months afterwards, when he<br>  should see misses in a public assembly, could not recollect that they were the<br>  persons with whom he drank tea. Perhaps they were present at the table, and<br>  perhaps they were not. But suppose they were—would it be any thing strange for<br>  a<br>  <em>gentleman</em>  to sit down at table with 20 misses, half of them perhaps, sitting in a direct<br>  line with himself, (so that it would be extremely difficult for him to see<br>  them) and not seeing their countenances so as immediately to recollect them<br>  when seen a number of weeks afterwards, with their bonnets on—in a different<br>  attire—in a “court of Justice?” Surely these gentlemen—as they said they could<br>  not recollect them—must be set down as liars, for no one can doubt—considering<br>  the circumstances—that there was a<br>  <em>reasonable possibility</em>  of their not knowing them at a glance—whether they were there or not. We would<br>  advise the writer of that article to look up much reckless villains and have<br>  them tried for perjury.<br></p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>  JUSTICE.<br></p>",

    "commentary": "This letter stands as perhaps the most important<br>indication of the local Black male presence in <em>The Unionist</em>. As was the case in the trial transcripts, a Black history lesson is embedded in the frequent use of \"Cato\" as a pen name. During the time of the American Revolution, the white founding fathers specifically wanted to shape the new government like that of the Roman Republic, not the Roman Empire. Hence they preferred the mythos of Cato - exemplifying moral courage and integrity - to that of Caesar's power grab. African-Americans, of course, found the white emphasis on liberty both puzzling - given the continued presence of slavery - and an opportunity to use this now-public rhetoric. Thus, as you can see in the illustration accompanying this entry, one of the most famous African-American petitions of the Revolutionary era came from \"Cato\" - a poor Black whose emancipation was in danger from an attempt to repeal a law granting liberty. Written in 1781, Cato's petition was well-known in the Black community.",

Judson and<br>Welch “spoke<br><em>“con amore.”</em>If Messrs. Ellsworth and Strong argue so powerfully and conclusively merely for<br>pay, what, we may well ask,<br><em>would they do</em>if they should speak<br><em>“con amore.</em>” We have no wish to underrate the merits of the counsel for the prosecution; we<br>doubt not they did their best.

But were we desirous of eulogizing him and his colleague, we<br>would not accuse them of arguing such a cause<br><em>“con amore”</em>or represent them as having on that occasion exhibited “logical precision, and<br>elegance of language unusual even to themselves.”<br>",

Their children adopted both of their parents' names as their last name - Oaksmith. Her most famous quote is \"My friends, do we realize for what purpose we are convened? Do we fully understand that we aim at nothing less than an entire subversion of the present order of society, a dissolution of the whole existing social compact?\" This was asked at the 1852 National Woman's Rights Conference.

At a time when France and<br>England were yet involved in bigotry and superstition, Holland achieved for<br>herself civil and religious freedom, and opened her bosom as an asylum for the<br>oppressed Huguenots; while others, the pilgrim fathers sought a refuge from<br>persecution in the wilds of America. Holland for a long time took the lead of<br>all the surrounding nations in commerce, in science, in arts, and in arms. For<br>the inventions of the telescope, microscope, thermometer, pendulum, gunpowder,<br>and printing, the world is indebted to the Dutch. And the best and most correct<br>translation of the original Scriptures, in any language, is that of the Low<br>Dutch, made under the auspices of the Synod of Dort.<br>",

    "commentary": "This book, <em>The Americans, by an American in London</em>, by Calvin Colton (1789-1857), can be found in a [Hathitrust digitization.] (https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=yale.39002007679153&view=1up&seq=7&q1=american%20colonization%20society)  It is unlikely that Burleigh had read it, as it contains support for the American Colonization Society, which he would not have endorsed.  In this 1833 book, Colton sees both the impracticality of the American Colonization Society's project, and the evil of slavery, but still thinks that the Colonization Society is a benevolent organization that is gradually raising consciousness around the issue of slavery. When he returned to the United States in 1835, though, he became a strident anti-abolitionist, even writing a piece titled <em>Abolition, a Sedition</em> in 1839. For a full length scholarly article on Colton, see James D. Bratt, “From Revivalism to Anti-Revivalism to Whig Politics: The Strange Career of Calvin Colton.” <em>The Journal of Ecclesiastical History</em>, vol. 52, no. 1, 2001, pp. 63–82.",

    "transcription": "<p>From the Brooklyn Unionist, October 10</p><p>MISS CRANDALL’S SECOND TRIAL.</p><p>  Last Thursday Miss Crandall was brought before the Superior Court sitting in<br>  this place, (Judge Daggett on the bench,) upon an information similar to that<br>  on which she was tried at the last session of the County Court. She had been<br>  bound over to answer to two complaints, one for teaching, and the other for<br>  boarding colored persons from other states., but was tried on the former only.<br>  A.T. Judson, Esq. and C.F. Cleaveland, the State’s Attorney, conducted the<br>  prosecution, Henry Strong, Esq. and Hon. Calvin Goddard the defence. The plea<br>  as on the former trial was <em>not guilty.</em>  Several witnesses were examined, the facts necessary to conviction were<br>  proved, and nothing remained but to establish the constitutionality of the<br>  law.<br></p><p>  Mr. Judson opened the case for the prosecution and pursued much the same train<br>  of argument as on the former trial, except that in addition to the points then<br>  made, he contended that the clause in the constitution which was made the<br>  ground of the defence, was intended as a rule of action to the general<br>  government only, and not to the State Legislatures. He was followed by Mr.<br>  Strong, who, in a powerful, logical and conclusive argument, clearly exhibited<br>  the unconstitutionality of the law, showing that the Constitution<br>  <em>was</em> made to control the action of the state Legislatures; that it was intended to<br>  secure to all citizens of the United States, the enjoyment of such privileges<br>  and immunities as are fundamental; that the privilege of obtaining an<br>  education is fundamental; and that free blacks are citizens, and of course<br>  entitled, though citizens of other states, to the same privileges as our own<br>  colored population, and among others to that of acquiring knowledge here. Mr.<br>  Goddard closed for the defence, briefly but eloquently, and the State’s<br>  Attorney having concluded on the part of the prosecution, the judge rose and<br>  saying a few words respecting the importance of the question, and his<br>  inability to do it justice, declined giving his charge till the next morning.<br></p><p>  On Friday morning as soon as the court was opened every seat was occupied and<br>  many persons stood unable to obtain seats, all listening with profound<br>  attention to the charge. It occupied as nearly as we could estimate, about an<br>  hour, and as will be seen by the outline given below was decidedly in favor of<br>  the constitutionality of the law.<br></p><p>  After stating to the Jury the charge on which Miss Crandall was brought before<br>  them, His Honor Judge Daggett proceeded: “In relation to the facts there does<br>  not appear to be much controversy—it is your province however to decide<br>  whether they have been proved. It is also your province to decide as to the<br>  law, the court cannot direct you as to either. But it is the duty of the court<br>  to advise you in respect to the law.<br></p><p>  It is claimed that the law under which this prosecution is instituted, is<br>  unconstitutional. If it be, it is because it violates the constitution<br>  of the United States, for it is not violation of the constitution of<br>  Connecticut. The question then is, Does this law violate the constitution of<br>  the United States? If a law is clearly unconstitutional, it is the duty of the<br>  humblest court in the land, even a justice of the peace, so to pronounce it,<br>  for all judges, under which name are included jurors when acting as judges,<br>  are bound by the constitution or laws in the respective states to the contrary<br>  notwithstanding.<br></p><p>  In considering the question, “Is this law unconstitutional,” you will lay out<br>  of consideration all extrinsic matter, slavery, and all its enormous evils;<br>  the degradation of the blacks, and the utility and necessity of their being<br>  educated, except so far as it is necessary to determine whether the privilege<br>  of education is fundamental, of which I have no doubt.<br></p><p>There are two points to be considered.</p><p>  1<sup>st</sup>  . The constitution secures to all citizens of the U.S. the privileges and<br>  immunities of citizens in the several states. The construction of this section<br>  <em>is not,</em>  as was contended at the bar, that it regulates only the action of the general<br>  Government: it is operative as well upon the state Legislature as upon<br>  Congress.<br></p><p>  2<sup>nd</sup>  . Are the persons affected by this law, citizens of the United States. The law<br>  prohibits colored persons from Havana coming here, as well as the blacks of<br>  other states. With respect to the former, the right of exclusion is<br>  unquestionable, for they are not citizens of the United States. Are the<br>  colored inhabitants of this country citizens? It is the opinion of this court<br>  that they are not. Are slaves citizens of the United States? The constitution<br>  recognizes them only as the basis of representation and taxation. I refer to<br>  the definition of the word citizen as given by Mr. Webster, the ablest<br>  philologist of this or any country. (The judge here read the several<br>  definitions of the word as given in Webster’s dictionary, the last of which,<br>  and the only one applicable to the case is as follows—“In the United States, a<br>  person, native or naturalized, who has the privilege of exercising the<br>  elective franchise, and of purchasing and holding real estate.”) Slaves, then,<br>  are not citizens, in any of the state constitutions. Are Indians citizens? It<br>  is difficult to say what they are, but they are not citizens. Kent, in his<br>  commentaries, speaks of them as distinct tribes, living under the protection<br>  of the government,—2 Kent, 70. Are the free people of color citizens? I<br>  answer, No. They are not so styled in the Constitution of the United States,<br>  or, so far as I am aware, in the laws of Congress or of any of the states. In<br>  that clause of the constitution which fixes the basis of representation, there<br>  was an opportunity to have called them citizens if they were so considered.<br>  But that makes free<br>  <em>persons</em>  (adding three fifths of all other persons,) the basis of representation and<br>  taxation..<br></p><p>  It has been said that free blacks own vessels which participate in the<br>  peculiar privileges of American shipping. But this claim has never been<br>  settled by judicial decisions. I know of no case where this question has been<br>  settled. It is said also that blacks may sue in the U.S. Courts, but this too,<br>  has never, within my knowledge been decided. It is claimed that they are<br>  citizens because they may be guilty of treason, but so may any person who<br>  resides under the government and enjoys its protection, if he rises up against<br>  it.<br></p><p>  [His honor then read from Kent’s commentaries II, 210 a note in which the<br>  commentator speaks of the degraded condition of the blacks and the<br>  disabilities under which they labor, and thence inferred that in Kent’s<br>  opinion they were not citizens.]<br></p><p>  Another reason for believing that people of color were not considered<br>  citizens, is found in the fact that when the United States Constitution was<br>  adopted every state except Massachusetts, tolerated slavery. The slave laws of<br>  New-York were as severe as those of any state in the Union. In 1740 a slave in<br>  that state was convicted by three justices and jury of five, and burnt at the<br>  stake. God forbid that I should add to the degradation of this people, by<br>  stating these things, but such is our condition.<br></p><p>  But if free blacks are citizens I am not prepared to say that the law is<br>  <em>unconstitutional,</em> though on this point I have more doubts than on the other. The constitution of<br>  the United States did not profess to vest in the State Legislatures any new<br>  powers, but to abridge those already possessed. I see not but the Legislature,<br>  under their general power, might pass this law, I say nothing of its justice<br>  or injustice, for I do not stand here to justify or abuse the legislature<br>  which passed it. If the people disapprove the law, let them choose better men<br>  to represent them who will repeal it. The privilege of acquiring an education<br>  is certainly a fundamental privilege, but I am of opinion that the Legislature<br>  may regulate it.<br></p><p>  The jury went out, and after an absence of 20 or 30 minutes returned with a<br>  verdict of GUILTY.<br></p><p>  A bill of exceptions was filed by the defendant’s council, and the case will<br>  be carried to the Supreme Court of Errors, which will sit here next July.”<br></p>",

The charge on which she was<br>  tried was for teaching colored people from other states. The Judge instructed<br>  the jury that free people of color are not citizens, and that the law of<br>  Connecticut is, therefore, not unconstitutional. The jury went out and after<br>  an absence of 20 or 30 minutes, returned with a verdict of guilty. A bill of<br>  exceptions was filed and the case put over to the Supreme Court of Errors, to<br>  be holden at Brooklyn next July.<br></p><p>  On this singular decision we remark that if the case be so that free colored<br>  people are not citizens of the United States, their condition is far worse<br>  than we had supposed. But we canot believe this, the arguments in the decision<br>  notwithstanding; and we cannot account for it that such a decision comes from<br>  Judge Daggett, except on the supposition that strong feeling, excited in his<br>  native place (New Haven), by an attempt to erect a similar school there some<br>  time ago, has biased his judgment.<br></p><p>Judge Daggett says</p><p>  ‘Are the colored inhabitants of this country citizens? It is the opinion of<br>  this court that they are not. Are slaves citizens of the U.S.? The<br>  constitution recognizes them only as the basis of representation and taxation.<br>  I refer to the definition of the word citizen as given by Mr. Webster, the<br>  ablest philologist of this or any country. (The judge here read the several<br>  definitions of the word as given in Webster’s dictionary, the last of which,<br>  and the only one applicable to the case is as follows—“In the United States, a<br>  person, native or naturalized, who has the privilege of exercising the<br>  elective franchise, and of purchasing and holding real estate.”) Slaves, then,<br>  are not citizens, in any of the state constitutions. Are Indians citizens? It<br>  is difficult to say what they are, but they are not citizens. Kent, in his<br>  commentaries, speaks of them as distinct tribes, living under the protection<br>  of the government,—2 Kent, 70. Are the free people of color citizens? I<br>  answer, No. They are not so styled in the Constitution of the United States,<br>  or, so far as I am aware, in the laws of Congress or of any of the states. In<br>  that clause of the constitution which fixes the basis of representation, there<br>  was an opportunity to have called them citizens if they were so considered.<br>  But that makes free <em>persons</em> (adding three fifths of all other persons,) the basis of representation and<br>  taxation.”<br></p><p>  “They” (the free people of color) are not so styled (citizens) in the<br>  constitution of the United States.” What then? is it not implied? The<br>  constitution does not so style free <em>white</em> persons, but does it not imply as much? Again, “In that clause which fixes the<br>  basis of representation, there was an opportunity to have called them citizens<br>  if they were so considered.” And so there was an opportunity to have called<br>  free white people citizens. If the omission excludes the one from citizenship,<br>  why not the other “But that (the constitution) makes free<br>  <em>persons</em>  (adding three fifths of all other persons) the basis of representation and<br>  taxation.” Now it seems to us that only two classes are here spoken of; first,<br>  free persons, who, absolutely, form a basis, and next, slaves, only three<br>  fifths of which form a basis. If then, the characteristic of forming a basis<br>  for representation and taxation, entire, without division (five fifths of a<br>  man and not three fifths) constitutes citizenship, by what logic is it<br>  inferred that<br>  <em>free</em>  colored persons are not citizens? The constitution it is true says nothing<br>  about complexion, but does the omission therefore exclude free colored persons<br>  If so can any one tell why it does not exclude free white persons?<br></p><p>  Judge Daggett says, “another reason for believing that people of color were<br>  not considered citizens is found in the fact&nbsp; that when the United States<br>  constitution was adopted, every state except Massachusetts, tolerated<br>  slavery.” We are dull—we do not see how this related to the point in question.<br></p><p>  It was argued in the Court, that free blacks own vessels which participate in<br>  the peculiar privileges of American shipping, and that blacks may sue in the<br>  United States courts. This was overruled on the ground that those points had<br>  never been settled by judicial decisions. We suppose it is true that free<br>  colored people have owned vessels, and participated in the peculiar privileges<br>  of American shipping ever since the constitution was formed, that they have<br>  also had suits in the U.S. Courts, and that they have received protections as<br>  American Citizens from British impressment. And it seems incredible that this<br>  should have gone of 57 years, unquestioned, if they were not in reality<br>  American citizens.<br></p><p>  What aid the definition of Webster gives to the decision we do not see. “In<br>  the United States (a citizen is) a person, native or naturalized, who has the<br>  privilege of exercising the elective franchise, and of purchasing and holding<br>  real estate.” Now in seven states the persons in question have the right of<br>  the elective franchise, and in all the right of purchasing and holding<br>  realestate. Does not the definition then make against the decision rather than<br>  for it?<br></p><p>  In this decision also Judge Daggett has gone in the face of very high opinion.<br>  In the Convention of New York for amending the constitution, on the motion to<br>  insert the word<br>  <em>white</em>  before the words “<br>  <em>male citizens,”</em>  in the article relating to the right of suffrage, Peter A. Jay said, “Is not<br>  the right of suffrage a privilege? Can you deny it to a<br>  <em>citizen</em>  of Pennsylvania, who comes here and complies with your laws, merely because he<br>  is not six feet high, or because he is of a dark complexion?’ Chancellor Kent<br>  said<br></p><p>  “Suppose a<br>  <em>negro</em>  owning a freehold, and entitled to vote in Vermont, removes to this state, can<br>  we constitutionally exclude him from the privilege of voting? The constitution<br>  of the United States provides that<br>  <em>citizens</em>  of each State shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of<br>  citizens of the several States.”<br></p><p>Rufus King said</p><p>  ‘Take the fact that a<br>  <em>citizen of color</em>  entitled to all the privileges of a citizen, comes here—he purchases a<br>  freehold—can you deny him the rights of an elector incident to his freehold?<br>  He is entitled to vote because like<br>  <em>any other citizen</em>  he is a freeholder, and ever freeholder your laws entitle to vote.’<br></p><p>And again,</p><p>  “<br>  <em>    As certainly as the children of any white men are citizen, so certainly the<br>    children of black men are citizens.”<br>  </em></p><p>Abram Van Vechten said,</p><p>  ‘There is another and to my mind an insuperable objection to the exclusion of<br>  free citizens of color from the right of suffrage, arising from the provision<br>  of the Constitution of the U.S. that the citizens of each State shall be<br>  entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several<br>  States.’<br></p><p>  In 1826 De Witt Clinton demanded of President Adams the release of ‘Gilbert<br>  Horton a free man of color and a citizen of this state’ (New York) unlawfully<br>  imprisoned in the District of Columbia, on the ground that he was ‘a free man<br>  and a citizen.’<br></p><p>  We cannot believe with Judge Daggett that the whole free colored population<br>  of our country is outlawed, that emancipation confers as privilege but that of<br>  rambling about. And we hope there is a higher appeal yet than the Supreme<br>  Court of blinded Connecticut before which this case may be tried. We believe<br>  the people of Canterbury and their abettors are heaping up for themselves a<br>  load of odium, which they will find it difficult to bear.”<br></p>",

The case was carried directly to the Court of Errors. The Hon. Judge, in giving his opinion in favor of the<br>  <em>constitutionality</em>  of the “Black law” did not, as we learn by a private letter, commit himself to<br>  any opinion in favor of the law itself.<br></p><p>  The question of constitutionality turned mainly upon this point, whether the<br>  persons affected by the law are <em>citizens</em> of the United States. The judge relied on the definition in Webster, that<br>  citizens are those who enjoy the elective franchise, and can hold real estate,<br>  and it has never been judicially decided that blacks can do this, or sue in<br>  the United States Courts. A writer in the “Unionist,” who seems to have<br>  examined the subject, shows that the right of suffrage may be exercised in<br>  New-Hampshire by male <em>inhabitants;</em>  in Vt. by a <em>man;</em> in Mass. by male<br>  <em>citizens;</em>  (under which term blacks have always voted, and one has held a seat as<br>  representative,) in R. I. by a <em>subject;</em>  in N.Y. blacks of certain qualifications can vote; in Pa. every<br>  <em>freeman,</em> and the same in N.C. and Tenn. The constitutions of Md., Va. N.C. Ky. Ala.<br>  Miss. Mo. And Lou. limit the right of voting to free <em>white</em> citizens, which would be superfluous unless blacks may be citizens. The same<br>  number of the Unionist contains extracts from speeches delivered in the<br>  convention of New-York, 1821, by such men as Peter A. Jay,  James Kent, Rufus<br>  King, Abraham Van Vechten, all maintaining expressly that people of color are<br>  citizens.

    "transcription": "<p>  Mr. Editor,—I have just received the following invaluable communication from<br>  Hon. Wm. Jay, of Bedford, Westchester, Co. N. Y. a man of the highest<br>  respectability. Unfortunately it was not mailed until three days after it was<br>  written; else it might have reached this place in time for the late trial of<br>  Miss Crandall,—and who knows but the opinions of such men as Clinton, and<br>  King, and Van Vechten, and Kent, and Jay might have shaken even Judge<br>  Daggett’s confidence in his own opinion, respecting the citizenship of colored<br>  people?<br></p><p>  Being, as I am, fully persuaded, that<br>  <strong>    the learned Judge has given his sanction to an erroneous notion, that may do<br>    inconceivable mischief in our country, if it be not corrected<br>  </strong>  . [this turned out to be all too true] I am most happy in being able to lay<br>  before the community in connection with his, the opinions of men who have held<br>  the highest rank at the Bar, on the Bench, in the Halls of Legislation, and in<br>  the Executive department of the States. Yours truly, Samuel J. May<br></p><p>--</p><p>  Bedford, 30<sup>th</sup>  Sept. 1833<br></p><p>  <em>Rev. Sir.</em>  —On the late trial of Miss Crandall, it was thought expedient by her opponents<br>  to attempt to deprive our whole free colored population, of the protection of<br>  the Constitution of the United States, by denying that they were<br>  <em>citizens.</em>  Should a second trial be had, it is possible that the annexed authorities may<br>  be of some use and I will therefore commit them to your care, as I have not<br>  the honor of being acquainted with Miss Crandall’s counsel.<br></p><p>  With sincere respect for your exertions in the cause of humanity and freedom,<br>  I remain Rev. Sir&nbsp; Your very ob’t servant, WILLIAM JAY<br></p><p>--</p><p>  Extracts from ‘Reports of the proceedings and debates of the Convention of<br>  1821 assembled for the purpose of amending the Constitution of the State of<br>  New-Yor.’ By N.S. Carter and W.L. Stone.<br></p><p>  On a motion to insert the word ‘white’ before the words ‘male citizens’ in the<br>  article of the Constitution regulating the right of suffrage.<br></p><p>  ‘I would submit to the consideration of the committee whether the proposition<br>  is consistent with the constitution of the U. States. That instrument provides<br>  that ‘Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all the privileges and<br>  immunities of citizens in the several States.’ No longer ago than last<br>  November, the Legislature of this State almost unanimously resolved that ‘If<br>  the provisions contained in any proposed constitution of a new State, deny to<br>  <em>any citizens</em>  of the existing States, the privileges and immunities of citizens of such new<br>  State, that such proposed constitution should not be accepted or confirmed,<br>  the same in the opinion of this Legislature being void by the Constitution of<br>  the United States.’ Now Sir, is not the right of suffrage a privilege? Can you<br>  deny it to a citizen of Pennsylvania who comes here and complies with your<br>  laws, merely because he is not six feet high or because he is of a dark<br>  complexion.’ —Speech of Peter A. Jay, p. 184<br></p><p>  ‘No longer ago than last winter the Legislature of this State almost<br>  unanimously resolved ‘that their Senators be instructed and their<br>  Representatives requested to prevent any State from being admitted into this<br>  Union which should have incorporated into her constitution any provision<br>  denying to the<br>  <em>citizens</em>  of each State all the rights, privileges and immunities of citizens of the<br>  several states.’ These instructions and requests it is well known,<br>  particularly referred to Missouri, and were founded on a clause in her<br>  constitution interdicting<br>  <em>this very class of people</em>  ‘from coming to or settling in that state under any pretext whatever.”—<br>  <em>Speech of R. Clark, p. 189</em></p><p>  ‘Suppose a<br>  <em>negro</em>  owning a freehold, and entitled to a vote in Vermont, removes to this State,<br>  can we constitutionally exclude him from the privileges of voting? The<br>  constitution of the United States provides that<br>  <em>citizens</em>  of each State shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of<br>  citizens of the several states.’—<br>  <em>Speech of James Kent, (the Chancellor,) p.</em>  190<br></p><p>  ‘The constitution of the United States is beyond the control of any act of any<br>  of the States. It is a compact to which the people of this in common with<br>  those of other States are parties, and cannot recede from it, without the<br>  consent of all. With this understanding, what let me ask, is the meaning of<br>  the provision quoted by the gentleman from Albany (Mr. Kent.) Take the fact<br>  that a<br>  <em>citizen of color</em>  entitled to all the privileges of a citizen, comes here—he purchases a<br>  freehold—can you deny him the rights of an elector incident to his freehold?<br>  He is entitled to vote because like any<br>  <em>other</em>  citizen he is a freeholder, and every freeholder your laws entitled to vote.<br>  He comes here, he purchases property, he pays your taxes, conforms to your<br>  laws—how can you then under the article of the constitution of the U. States<br>  which has been read exclude him? The gentleman from N. York thinks that the<br>  meaning of this provision in the U.S. Constitution extends only to civil<br>  rights. Such is not the text, it is<br>  <em>all</em>  rights. This seems to me to lay an insuperable barrier in our way.<br>  <em>    As certainly as the children of any white men are citizens, so<br>    certainly&nbsp; the children of black men are citizens.’—Speech of Rufus<br>    King, p.<br>  </em>  192.<br></p><p>  ‘It seems to me that some gentlemen entertain doubts whether any of our people<br>  of color are in a legal sense citizens; but these doubts are unfounded. We are<br>  precluded from denying their citizenship by our uniform recognition for more<br>  than forty years—nay some of them were citizens when this State came into<br>  political existence—partook in our struggle for freedom and independence, and<br>  were incorporated into the body politic at its creation. There is another and<br>  to my mind an insuperable objection to the exclusion of free citizens of color<br>  from the right of suffrage, arising from the provision of the Constitution of<br>  the U.S. that the citizens of each State shall be entitled to all the<br>  privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States.’—<br>  <em>Speech of Abraham Van Vechten, p.</em>  193.<br></p><p>Letter from De Witt Clinton, Governor of N. York to President Adams.</p><p align=\"right\">  ALBANY, 4<sup>th</sup>  Sept. 1826<br></p><p>  Sir,—I have the honor to enclose copies of the proceedings of a&nbsp;<br>  respectable meeting in West Chester County in the State, and of an Affidavit<br>  of John Owen, by which it appears that one Gilbert Horton, a free man of color<br>  <em>and a citizen of this State</em>  is unlawfully imprisoned in the jail of the city of Washington, and is<br>  advertised to be sold by the Marshal of the District of Columbia. From<br>  whatever authority a law authorizing such proceedings may have emanated,<br>  whether from the municipality of Washington, the Legislature of Maryland, or<br>  the Congress of the United Sates, it is at least void and unconstitutional in<br>  its application to a<br>  <em>citizen,</em>  and could never have intended to extend further than to fugitive slaves. As<br>  the District of Columbia is under the exclusive control of the National<br>  Government I conceive it my duty to apply to you for the liberation of Gilbert<br>  Horton as a freeman,<br>  <em>and a citizen,</em>  and feel persuaded that this request will be followed by immediate relief.<br></p><p>I have the honor to be &amp;c. DE WITT CLINTON.”</p>",

It will be<br>  seen that Judge D. has given it as his opinion, that no colored man is a<br>  citizen of the United States. This opinion, we are sure, will be viewed with<br>  astonishment in many parts of the Union. In Massachusetts, the constitution<br>  and laws have never deprived any man of any privilege on account of the color<br>  of his skin. The black man there votes, buys and sells real estate, and is<br>  eligible to the office of Judge, Senator, or Governor. The same is true of<br>  Maine, and we believe also of Vermont, New Hampshire, and several other<br>  States. In Connecticut and New York, it is true, the laws are not equally<br>  creditable to the humanity and republicanism of the people; and in most of the<br>  states farther south, there are distinctions between different classes of the<br>  population still more opposed to sound moral and political principle, but we<br>  believe that Judge D. is the first judge in the United States who has<br>  officially expressed the opinion, that free colored men are not citizens. We<br>  cannot believe that this is sound law, and we are supported in this belief by<br>  some of the ablest jurists in our country, whose opinions we quote below.<br></p><p>  While we are on this subject we must caution our foreign friends not to make<br>  too wide an application of the censure which they may found on the proceedings<br>  in the case of Miss Crandall. So far as we have noticed, those proceedings,<br>  beyond the limits of Connecticut, are everywhere viewed with marked<br>  disapprobation. We regard them as the offspring of a delusion similar to that<br>  which pervades Georgia in relation to the Cherokees. It is local, and we trust<br>  it will be temporary.<br></p><p>  The opinions of the jurists referred to above, are contained in the following<br>  extracts from “Reports of the proceedings and debates of the Convention of<br>  1821, assembled for the purpose of amending the Constitution of the State of<br>  New-York.” The extracts were made by Judge W.

    "transcription": "As the Unionist has requested, we have reperused our remarks upon the conduct<br>and designs of the abolitionists, and we find little to modify and nothing to<br>retract. To the charge of severity and injustice towards the characters of the<br>leaders in this crusade, we reply—<br><em>Physician heal thyselfˆ–</em>clear your own eyes of motes and films before you proceed to pull out beams from<br>the eyes of others. The whole vocabulary of abuse and contumely has been<br>exhausted by the abolitionists in their attempts to defame the motives and<br>blacken the characters of the members of the Colonization society—so that now we<br>scarcely see aught else in the columns of the Liberator and Emancipator, but<br>numerous repetitions of the same false and unfounded charges. Indeed, one would<br>think, from the matter contained in those papers, that their<br><em>sole</em>object is to destroy the Colonization society; as if that being accomplished,<br>every thing else was easy. Now let the merits of abolitionism be ten times what<br>its warmest abettors assert, no reasonable objection can be made to the<br>Colonization Society whatever. It proposes to transport free blacks to Africa<br>with their own consent, and if the blacks are willing to go, pray may not<br><em>free white</em>men give their money for the purpose without asking the consent of the President<br>of the Anti-Slavery Society? Where was the kindness and charity of Garrison, yea<br>more, where was his regard for moral probity, when he said that his object in<br>going to England was to raise funds for the establishment of a manual labor<br>school—and now, since his return, he acknowledges that he was induced to the<br>voyage by a desire to represent (misrepresent he should have said) the object<br>and designs of the Colonization Society to the English. That he slandered his<br>countrymen in London, there is abundant proof. Since he returned, he denies<br>it—so that no less than four falsehoods lie at his door, without the possibility<br>of any good accruing from either. How much was there “of the law of kindness as<br>well as of the requisitions of justice” in the latter which the patron of the<br>Unionist wrote to some students, and which he requested might be published; when<br>he said that he looked upon the Colonization Society<br><em>in no other light than an emissary of Satan</em>—whose only object is to perpetuate slavery? And who have been more frequently<br>accused of falsehood and misrepresentation than Rev. Mr. Gurley and Mr. Finley?<br>We do not ask these questions to justify ourselves if we have done wrong, but<br>merely to, let our “brother” see that it ill becomes him to throw stones. Till<br>he &amp; his sect are free from sin they should be slow in condemning others. As<br>to what we asserted concerning the leaders in the abolition enterprize, we deem<br>it strictly true. When they are told that the constitution forbids the free<br>states from meddling with property at the south, they reply in the language of<br>the Apostle to the Jewish Ruler—we must obey God and not man—thus asserting<br>their independence of the laws under which we live. If they respect the laws,<br>why does not Miss Crandall dismiss her school? Till the decision of Judge Dagget<br>is over ruled, that decision is the law of the land, which every honest citizen<br>is bound to respect—and yet we see the Genius of Temperance, (the Editors of<br>which call themselves Christians par excellence) encouraging her to continue in<br>opposition to a decree of one of the highest tribunals in the state. We find the<br>abolitionists endeavoring to cast contempt upon the Colonization Society,<br>because the latter speak of what is expedient to be done, in opposition to the<br>designs of the&nbsp; former—and meeting in the&nbsp; writings of a gentleman of<br>talents and learning, a quotation about&nbsp; expediency being “a wrap-rascal,”<br>they have rung the charges upon it, till it has fairly become stale, not<br>forgetting in the excess of their charity to insinuate that whoever may doubt of<br>the expediency of a measure, there can be no question as to the character which<br>such person&nbsp; should sustain in their own immaculate conceptions. Did these<br>over scrupulous gentlemen every hear or read of one who said that “all things<br>are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient.” In the present state of<br>the country immediate and unconditional abolition is neither<br><em>expedient</em>nor<br><em>lawful</em>—and those engaged in promoting it are only planting the seeds of sedition. Let<br>them beware that in sowing the wind, they do not reap the whirlwind.<br>",

It is well known to those who<br>  have perused the Liberator during the past year, from the facts given in the<br>  2d No.,of the present volume, that a colored man of the name of Ray was<br>  formerly a student in the Wesleyan University, and that he was under the<br>  necessity of leaving it (the university) on account of the prejudices of<br>  certain students. We are informed that the person who sent letters to the<br>  Liberator, which he had received relative to Mr Ray’s leaving, incurred the<br>  severest displeasure of those prejudiced students. It is probably known that<br>  he was not then a member of the university. The excitement however soon passed<br>  away, and in the course of a few months he entered the university. As the<br>  subject of the above letter wished to pursue certain studies, instruction was<br>  given him in that student’s room. Mr Beman recited three times each week, and<br>  for a considerable time was unmolested other than by the reproachful terms of<br>  a few base fellows as he passed to and fro from his recitation. His conduct<br>  towards others was ever such as to merit a gentlemanlike deportment from them,<br>  but this he did not receive. When those disaffected students found that<br>  reproaches did not deter him from pursuing his course of recitations, they<br>  resorted to other means. In going out from the university on a certain<br>  morning, a quantity of water was thrown upon him, by which he was<br>  <em>completely drenched.</em>  Some time in the course of the next day one of the party interested in the<br>  affair caused a notice to be put up, calling a meeting of the students, that<br>  evening, the spirit of which was such as to lead many to think it was written<br>  by one not unfriendly to Mr Beman. This trick however was discovered, and<br>  exposed at the meeting before mentioned. When the meeting was open ed, that<br>  <em>very person</em>  who wrote the notice, and who, there is strong reason to believe, was<br>  concerned in insulting Mr Beman, rose and<br>  <em>    offered a resolution disapproving the conduct of those engaged in that<br>    affair.<br>  </em>  After the subject before the meeting had been with much warmth discussed, and<br>  a request having been made that the student who then instructed Mr B. would<br>  hear him recite at some other place, the meeting was dissolved. &nbsp;This<br>  request, for the sake of producing harmony among the students, was, in form,<br>  complied with, but owing to the subsequent advice of some friends, the<br>  recitation went on as before, till the college vacation. Since the<br>  Commencement, for the convenience of him who is instructing Mr B, the<br>  recitation has not been heard in the university. All went on very well till<br>  this letter was received, which has produced much excitement and unpleasant<br>  feeling. It will not prevent the instruction that may be desired however.<br></p><p>  In this letter there is one thing not very consistent, and, to a certain<br>  extent, unaccountable; that is, that such a request and such a threat should<br>  be made when the subject of it does not recite in the university. It may be<br>  that there are certain ones who are unwilling that the colored people should<br>  be educated in any way whatever, and are endeavoring to drive those who may<br>  wish to pursue any course of study from their places of instruction. But we<br>  feel thankful that the<br>  <em>‘Canterbury law’</em>  has no effect in this case, for the subject is not a<br>  <em>‘foreigner.’</em>  ”<br></p><p>  The foregoing facts may be relied on, for we have received them from those who<br>  are immediately acquainted with the circumstances.<br></p><p>  The Unionist and Emancipator will confer a favor by copying this<br>  article.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>  TRUTH<br></p><p>MIDDLETOWN, Conn.

    "transcription": "<p>  “If the Unionist is determined not to understand, but to misconceive, we<br>  cannot be responsible. If we have been “unjust,” we are ready to make<br>  amends—but the “severity” must in all probability be laid at the door of<br>  truth, and the latter will take care of herself. All that we have to say is,<br>  that we have not wittingly “misrepresented” any body. We have spoken of the<br>  abolitionists with freedom, and shall do it again. Their designs are of a<br>  character that do not require that we should be very mincing in our words, or<br>  exceeding choice of our language. We mean, at all times, that it shall be<br>  decent and respectful, for the sake of the public—but we are not aware of any<br>  peculiar obligation that we are under to suit our phrases to the holiday<br>  conceptions of those from whom we differ. We disclaimed, expressly, the<br>  justice of retorting railing for tailing, and yet the Unionist suppresses the<br>  disclaimer totally, and<br>  <em>yet treats us as if we justified it.</em>  This is a specimen, we presume, of abolitionist propriety. The Unionist says—<br></p><p>  <strong>    “We do not wish the free states to ‘meddle with property at the south,” or<br>    to interfere in any shape or form, with slavery at the south, except by<br>    legal and constitutional methods. Our only meddling is such as almost all<br>    the papers in the land have been guilty of, whenever they have denounced<br>    Russian tyranny, or sympathized with Polish patriots suffering under<br>    imperial despotism. In short the only medling of which we are, or wish to be<br>    guilty, is the utterance of the truth, the exposure of the evils and guilt<br>    of slavery, the asserting and proving that its abolition will be for the<br>    good of all parties concerned, the petitioning Congress for its abolition in<br>    those parts of the country which are under the exclusive jurisdiction of the<br>    General Government.”<br>  </strong></p><p>  Thus pray what is the use of your keeping up this constant agitation at the<br>  North,<br>  <em>where there are no slaves,</em>  and upon what grounds do you justify your opposition to, and wholesale abuse<br>  of, the Colonization Society. If any person is to be enlightened, it is the<br>  Southern planter. Why not go to the South and disperse your lucubrations—if<br>  they are so very cogent, wise, and convincing? You are a citizen of the U.<br>  States, and the Constitution guaranties the freedom of speech and of the<br>  press. Go to the South, if your zeal is so abundant, your logic so good, and<br>  be sure that your effusions will be read. If the above extract is the truth,<br>  (and who shall gainsay it?) how does it condemn the leaders, (for the Unionist<br>  is too modest to assume that title,) how does it, we say, condemn the conduct<br>  of the leaders in this “crusade” against the Colonization Society, and the<br>  Constitution. Such as the Unionist may be too timid to avow their real<br>  designs—but that the leaders look forward to some modification, and if that<br>  cannot be obtained, some infraction of the Constitution, few persons opposed<br>  to them have much doubt. If this extract from the Unionist speaks the language<br>  of the main body of the abolitionists, they must moderate their tone before<br>  the public mind can be convinced. If the above is all they aim at, they are<br>  laboring in a hopeless cause.”<br></p>",

    "transcription": "“We see it stated in the “Unionist,” a paper published at Brooklyn, Ct., that a<br>memorial is in circulation in the eastern part of the State, the object of<br>which is, ‘the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia.’ Persons<br>frequently put their names to papers of this description without sufficient<br>reflection, and on the exparte statement of those who are interested, or have an<br>object in procuring signatures. Our object in penning this notice is to caution<br>the public against the movements of the fanatics, and to request every<br>intelligent man to consider well what he is about before signing this memorial.<br>It as a scheme fraught with dangerous and alarming consequences—a project that<br>cannot be executed—and the very attempt to effect it, threatens the tranquility<br>of the Union. We regard these movements of the northern agitators, in as<br>infamous a light as those of the southern nullifiers, and they should meet with<br>universal condemnation. It has been intimated that some of our members of<br>Congress would countenance this insane project: but we do not believe that the<br>madness of party desperation will carry any one of them so far. Let no man sign<br>this memorial who loves his country and would preserve the Union.”<br>",
    "commentary": "The notice about this petition could have appeared in late October or early<br>November 1833 in the<br><em>Unionist.</em>Resolutions to end slavery in the District of Columbia were part of the New-England Anti-Slavery<br>meeting in January 1833, and the American Anti-Slavery organizational meeting in<br>December 1833. Samuel J May introduced the resolution, which was seconded by Crandall lawyer William Ellsworth in the December meeting. So a local campaign in eastern Connecticut, spearheaded by the Unionist, makes sense.<br>",

It is only by<br>  multiplying words, and turning off the attention from the true merits of the<br>  debate, that the abolitionists can hope to obtain a hearing. No better<br>  evidence is wanted of the weakness of the cause than the confessions of the<br>  Genius of Temperance, that Abolition cannot hope to succeed without the<br>  destruction of the Colonization Society. That Society has effected the<br>  emancipation of many slaves, whereas abolitionism has not yet freed one.<br>  <em>By their fruits ye shall know them.</em>  Let us suppose a [..]se—not a very probable one, it must be confessed, yet if<br>  the abolitionists are to be believed they expect to see a part, at least, of<br>  it fulfilled—and are laboring to bring it about—Suppose that every person<br>  north of the Potomac and the Ohio rivers became an abolitionist—as dedicated<br>  and fierce as Garrison himself—that those who are south of this line remain<br>  just as they are—some few honorable to the Colonization Society, here and<br>  there one [..]ling and anxious to be rid of his slaves, but the great majority<br>  desirous to retain them.

Shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as<br>  this?” – HUMANITAS”<br></p><p>  “Mr. Speaker, Iniquitous and most dishonorable to Maryland is that dreary<br>  system of partial bondage, which her laws have hitherto supported with a<br>  solicitude worthy of a better object, and Citizens by their practice<br>  countenanced. Founded in a disgraceful traffic, to which the parent country<br>  lent her fostering aid, from motives of interest, but which even she would<br>  have disdained to encourage, had England been the destined mart of such<br>  inhuman merchandize; its continuance is as shameful as its origin.<br></p><p>  Eternal infamy await the abandoned miscreants whose selfish souls could ever<br>  prompt them to rob unhappy Afric of her souls, and freight them hither by<br>  thousands, to poison the fair Eden of liberty with the rank weed o individual<br>  bondage. Nor is it more to the credit of our ancestors that they did not<br>  command these savage spoilers to bear their hateful cargo to another shore,<br>  where the shrine of freedom knew no votaries, and every purchaser would at<br>  once be both a master and a slave.<br></p><p>  In the dawn of time, Mr. Speaker, when the rough feelings of barbarism had not<br>  experienced the softening touches of refinement, such an unprincipled<br>  prostration of the inherent rights of human nature, would have needed the<br>  gloss of an apology: but to the everlasting reproach of Maryland, be it said,<br>  that when her citizens rivalled the nation from whence they emigrated, in the<br>  knowledge of moral principles, and an enthusiasm in the cause of general<br>  freedom, they stooped to become the purchasers of their fellow creatures, and<br>  to introduce an hereditary bondage into the bosom of their country, which<br>  should widen with every successive generation.<br></p><p>  For my part, I would willingly draw the veil of oblivion over this disgusting<br>  scene of iniquity, but that the present abject state of those who are<br>  descended from these kidnapped sufferers, perpetually brings it forward to the<br>  memory.<br></p><p>  But wherefore should we confine the edge of censure to our ancestors, or those<br>  from whom they purchased? Are not we equally guilty?<br>  <em>They</em>  strewed around the seeds of slavery;<br>  <em>we</em>  cherish and sustain the growth.—<br>  <em>They</em>  introduced the system;<br>  <em>we</em>  enlarge, invigorate, and conform it.—Yes, let it be handed down to posterity,<br>  that the people of Maryland, who could fly to arms with the promptitude of<br>  Roman citizens, when the hand of oppression was lifted up against<br>  themselves—who could behold their country desolated, and their citizens<br>  slaughtered, who could brave with unshaken firmness, every calamity of war,<br>  before they would submit to the smallest infringement of their rights—that<br>  this very people could yet see thousands of their fellow creatures, within the<br>  limits of their territory, bending beneath an unnatural yoke; and instead of<br>  being assiduous to destroy their shackles, anxious to immortalize their<br>  duration, so that a nation of slaves might for ever exist in a country where<br>  freedom is its boast.<br></p><p>  “Even the very earth itself, (says some celebrated author) which teems with<br>  profusion under the cultivating hand of the freeborn laborer, shrinks into<br>  barrenness from the contaminating sweat of a slave.” This sentiment is not<br>  more figuratively beautiful than substantially just.<br></p><p>  Survey the countries, sir, where the hand of freedom conducts the ploughshare<br>  and compare their produce with yours.—Your granaries in this view appear like<br>  the store houses of emmets [a colloquial word for “ant”], though not supplied<br>  with equal industry. To trace the cause of this disparity between the fruits<br>  of a freeman’s voluntary labors, animated by the hope of profit, and the<br>  slow-paced efforts of a slave, who acts only from compulsion, who has no<br>  incitement to exertion but fear—no prospect of remuneration to encourage—would<br>  be insulting the understanding. The cause and the effect are too obvious to<br>  escape observation.<br></p><p>  But it has been said (and who knows but the same opinion may still have its<br>  advocates) “that nature has black balled these wretches out of society.”<br>  Gracious God! can it be supposed that they Almighty Providence intended to<br>  proscribe these victims of fraud and power, from the pale of society, because<br>  thou hast denied them the delicacy of an European complexion? Is their color,<br>  Mr. Speaker, the mark of Divine vengeance, or is it only the flimsy pretext<br>  upon which we attempt to justify our treatment of them? Arrogant and<br>  presumptuous is it this to make the dispensations of Providence subservient to<br>  the purposes of iniquity, and every slight diversity in the works of nature<br>  the apology for oppression. Thus acts the intemperate bigot in religion. He<br>  persecutes every dissenter from his creed, in the name of God, and even rears<br>  the horrid fabric of an inquisition upon heavenly foundations.<br></p><p>  I like not these holy arguments. They are as convenient for the tyrant as the<br>  patriot—the enemy as the friend of mankind. Contemplate this subject through<br>  the calm medium of philosophy, and then to know that these shackled wretches<br>  are men as well as we are, spring from the same common parent, and endued with<br>  equal faculties of mind and body, is to know enough to make us disdain to torn<br>  casuists on their complexion to the destruction of their rights. The beauty of<br>  complexion is mere matter of taste, and varies indifferent countries, nay,<br>  even in the same; and shall we dare to set up this vague, indeterminate,<br>  weathercock standard, as the criterion by which shall be decided on what<br>  complexions the rights of human nature are conferred, and to what they are<br>  denied by the great ordinances of the Deity? As if the Ruler of the Universe<br>  had made the darkness of a skin, the flatness of a nose, or the wideness of a<br>  mouth, which are only deformities or beauties as the undulating tribunal of<br>  taste shall determine the indication of his wrath.<br></p><p>  Mr. Speaker, It is pitiable to reflect on the mistaken light in which this<br>  unfortunate generation are viewed by the people in general. Hardly do they<br>  deign to rank them in the order of beings above the mere animal that grazes<br>  the field of its owner. That an humble, dusky, unlettered wretch that drags<br>  the chain of bondage through the weary round of life, with no other privilege<br>  but that of existing for another’s benefit should have been intended by heaven<br>  for their equal they will not believe. But let me appeal to the intelligent<br>  mind, and ask, in what respect they are our inferiors? Though they have never<br>  been taught to tread the paths of science, or embellish human life by literary<br>  acquirements; tho’ they cannot soar into the regions of taste and sentiment,<br>  or explore the scenes of philosophical research, is it to be inferred that<br>  they want the power, if the yoke of slavery did not check each aspiring effort<br>  and clog the springs of action? Let the kind hand of an assiduous care mature<br>  their powers, let the genius of freedom excite to manly thought and liberal<br>  investigation, we should not then be found to monopolize the vigor of fancy,<br>  the delicacy of taste, or the solidity of scientific endowments. Born with<br>  hearts as susceptible of virtuous impressions as our own, and with minds as<br>  capable of benefitting by improvement, they are in all respects our equals by<br>  nature; and he who thinks otherwise has never reflected, that talents however<br>  great may perish unnoticed and unknown, unless auspicious circumstances<br>  conspire to draw them forth, and animate their exertions in the round of<br>  knowledge. As well might you expect to see the bubbling fountain gush from the<br>  burning sands of Arabia, as that the inspiration of genius or the enthusiastic<br>  glow of sentiment should rouse the mind which has yielded its elasticity to<br>  habitual subjection. Thus the ignorance and the vices of these wretches are<br>  solely the result of situation, and therefore no evidence of their<br>  inferiority. Like the flower whose culture has been neglected, and perishes<br>  amidst permitted weeds ere it opens it blossom to the Spring, they only prove<br>  the imbecility of human nature unassisted and oppressed. Well has Cowper said—<br></p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘’Tis<br>  liberty alone which gives the flower<br></p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of fleeting<br>  life its lustre and perfume,<br></p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And we are<br>  weeds without it.’<br></p>",
    "commentary": "William Pinkney (1764-1822) was an important statesman in the Early Republic. Hailing from Maryland, he served that state in Congress and, at the end of his life, in the Senate. He also performed ably as a diplomat and Attorney General. His reputation as an orator was strong. Pinkney's speech here, from early in his career, was in circulation among the Abolitionists; his fame and his writings were amplified in the 1820s at the time of his death.",

    "transcription": "<p>  The following communication from a christian, a philanthropist, and a<br>  gentleman, we insert with pleasure. The language is energetic, occasionally<br>  severe, but we hold not ourself answerable for its severity. The circumstances<br>  of the case justify it. Cruel charges, unsubstantiated by the least shadow of<br>  evidence, have been too frequently brought against Abolitionists, and we have<br>  a right to demand the proof or a retraction, and if neither is given, he who<br>  makes those charge is, to say the least, a traducer of character.<br></p><p><em>For the Unionist.</em></p><p>To the Editor of the Norwich Courier</p><p>  SIR—I presume that you will agree with me in the sentiment that the editor of<br>  a public journal is under weighty responsibilities, and should suffer nothing<br>  to appear in the columns of his publication but with extreme caution. Opinions<br>  disseminated through the columns of a newspaper will, to a greater or less<br>  degree, influence the opinions of the reading community, and when the editor<br>  of a paper advocates any particular doctrine, he doubtless desires that his<br>  readers may adhere to the same doctrine. Great care therefore is necessary<br>  that a person in your connexion with community should disseminate thro’ that<br>  community, precepts which shall bear the test of truth—principles founded upon<br>  the strictest rules of justice and sound morality. You sir, I presume,<br>  professing to be governed by high and honorable motives, will readily assent<br>  to this, and at all times be willing to turn your attention to any thing which<br>  may have escaped your pen, and if any one of your readers should be so<br>  unfortunate as to differ from you in sentiment, you will, I presume,<br>  cheerfully examine the ground of their complaints, to be convinced, or to show<br>  some reason for a different course.<br></p><p>  I would request of you, sir, to re-peruse an article which appeared under your<br>  editorial head, Oct. 23d, in relation to Miss Crandall’s school and the<br>  sentiments of the abolitionists. I would ask you to do it calmly and<br>  dispassionately—<br>  <em>searching for the truth</em>  —unbiased by opinions previously expressed, farther than you find<br>  <em>reason</em>  to be your supporter.<br></p><p>  You say, “Although we think that Miss Crandall has a right to continue her<br>  school we are by no means friendly to the doctrines which are said to be<br>  taught in it; yet these doctrines can never be put down by persecution—they<br>  must be met by fair argument, and in such a contest they will prove wholly<br>  untenable.” I am glad to find that you have never denied the<br>  <em>right</em>  of Miss Crandall to teach such a school—it is rather a matter or surprise to<br>  me, as it probably is to you, that New-England should contain an enlightened<br>  man who<br>  <em>would</em>  deny that right. I know not what doctrines you have heard to be taught in that<br>  school, neither have you seen fit to inform the public. But you have said that<br>  <em>dangerous</em>  doctrines are taught there that ought to be “put down.” If so, are not you,<br>  sir, bound to tell us what these doctrines are, as you wish to enlighten the<br>  public all you can—to overthrow these dangerous doctrines, and to free society<br>  from their contamination, will you not condescend to meet them by “fair<br>  argument,” as “in such a contest” you are confident “they will prove wholly<br>  untenable?” I am anxious to see, what I have never yet seen and feat I never<br>  shal, the attempt made to “put them down” by “fair argument,” instead of<br>  addled eggs, &amp;c.<br></p><p>  You say again, “The least that can be said of the Abolition scheme is that it<br>  is an<br>  <em>insane</em>  project—one which no man in the full possession and exercise of his faculties<br>  can contemplate as being practicable, or at the present time desirable.” I<br>  know, sir, it is very easy for a person, especially when under a little<br>  excitement, to go on and make severe accusations against his opponents, but it<br>  is quite another thing to show the reason of these accusations. I might say<br>  that the editor of the Norwich Courier was governed by passion and prejudice,<br>  with as much ease as you charge Abolitionists of insanity; and I doubt not,<br>  sir, that I should be able to substantiate my charge as soon as you yours. I<br>  have seen similar charges in your paper before, but I have never known of your<br>  being more particular. You are satisfied with making a general assertion, why<br>  not specify wherein this insanity consists? The leading doctrine of the<br>  Abolitionists is that no man has a right to hold his fellow man in bondage a<br>  single moment. Is this insane? Is it untrue? Is it a fact that man<br>  <em>has a right</em>  to rob his fellow man of liberty—of<br>  <em>himself?</em>  If he<br>  <em>has</em>  such a right, tell me, sir, who gave him that right, and how long it is to<br>  continue. If he has a<br>  <em>right</em>  to hold him in bondage<br>  <em>one</em>  moment, how many moments may he have that right? But who are these insane<br>  Abolitionists? How long since this spirit of insanity come upon them? They are<br>  all around you—men of distinguished worth—of brilliant talents—to whom you,<br>  sire, in your highest estimation of yourself, never considered yourself worthy<br>  to be called an equal. You accuse them of forwarding a project which is not<br>  desirable. Do you pronounce them all hypocrites? No, you dare not, but they<br>  are<br>  <em>insane,</em>  and therefore may be, for aught you know, sincere. But they are men of<br>  exemplary piety—men of fervent prayer—of extensive influence in promoting the<br>  cause of our Redeemer. You have not been accustomed to pronounce them<br>  insane—even now you are ready to quote their opinions upon other subjects and<br>  would place more confidence in their judgment than in your own. How happens it<br>  that their insanity is confined to this subject alone?<br></p><p>  You say, “The agitators appear to have bid adieu to common sense and a regard<br>  for the constitution and the laws,” &amp;c. I know not what you call bidding<br>  adieu to common sense, but one thing I know, that the leading Abolitionists in<br>  our country are the leading men in every other project to benefit the human<br>  race—men distinguished for their moral courage, seeking for the approval of<br>  God rather than for the favor of man. They have inquired for the path of duty<br>  and having ascertained it they have not failed to run in that path. Some,<br>  perhaps, might say that common sense in this respect is a disposition to act<br>  in a manner most congenial with popular feeling, If this is your definition of<br>  the term, I admit that they have ‘bid adieu to common sense,’ but as I<br>  understand the term they have most strictly adhered to it.<br></p><p>  As for the charge of their disregarding the constitution and the laws, I think<br>  it a very grave accusation to be brought against many of the best men of our<br>  country. But you, sir, are not the only one who has seen fit to make<br>  it—neither are you the only one who has made it without specifying what part<br>  of the constitution or what laws they disregard—and I must tell you, sire,<br>  that neither you nor all the wholesale accusers who you join<br>  <em>can</em>  point out a single line of our constitution from which Abolitionists, as such,<br>  have departed. “Bid adieu to a regard for the constitution!” It is not<br>  true—and I here call upon you, sir, to clear your character from the<br>  imputation of falsehood. I would not say, sir, that you<br>  <em>intended</em>  to assert an untruth, but I<br>  <em>do</em>  say that you<br>  <em>have</em>  asserted one, and unless you retract or substantiate it, the charge of<br>  falsehood must rest upon you. Is it unconstitutional to assert that it is<br>  morally wrong to hold slaves? Does the constitution of a free, republican<br>  people forbid that we should<br>  <em>speak against</em>  chaining the mortal body and degrading the immortal mind? Is it against the<br>  constitution of a Christian people to declaim against the cruel system of<br>  slavery? —to say that it is contrary to the righteous laws of God—that it is<br>  inconsistent with the spirit of the gospel and the precepts of our Savior? Is<br>  it a fact that the<br>  <em>republicans</em>  of the United States hold one sixth of their number in the chains of the<br>  verist despotism—that<br>  <em>two millions</em>  of our fellow creatures are groaning under worse than Egyptian servitude—that<br>  <em>two million</em>  of immortal souls are shut out from the light of science and closed to the<br>  entrance of one cheering ray from the Sun of Righteousness—and that when a few<br>  fearless men stand forth and say that these things are<br>  <em>wrong,</em>  you, the editor of a public journal, cry out that in so saying they have “bid<br>  adieu to a regard for the constitution?” Tell me, sir, if these things are<br>  facts? O that you could tell me that they were not facts! But, alas! they are.<br>  We must not say that it is<br>  <em>wrong</em>  to degrade the image of God to a level with the brutes that perish, for it is<br>  unconstitutional. Thank God!&nbsp; we have no such constitution as this! Shame<br>  on my countrymen! Shame on any republican asserting such a doctrine! I know<br>  the constitution<br>  <em>permits</em>  the several states to hold slaves if they choose—but no where does it say that<br>  we<br>  <em>shall not</em>  raise our voices against this abominable system. Wherein, then, have<br>  Abolitionists “bid adieu to a regard for the constitution?” Will you, sir,<br>  point out this treason, or cease longer to make an unfounded accusation?<br></p><p>  You say, “That this unprincipled opposition to the labors of the Colonization<br>  Society will raise up many warm friends to the latter there is abundant ground<br>  to hope.” As “unprincipled,: sir, as these ‘agitators’ may be, I deem it no<br>  disparagement to you to say that they are mi int eh splendor of whose moral<br>  qualities you would be hardly visible, and whose names will be breathed with<br>  veneration by the virtuous and the good when yours shall have long been<br>  forgotten. But I am perfectly willing that you should, if you can, console<br>  yourself that by this opposition many warm friends will be raised up to the<br>  Colonization Society, but perhaps it may soften future disappointment, to<br>  inform you that many of those who have been :warm friends” to that society are<br>  flocking around the Abolition standard, and however many ‘warm friends’ the<br>  Colonization Society may have, the cause of Abolition must forever stand. AS<br>  long as justice reigns in heaven and sin is found on earth, so long will those<br>  be found who will exert themselves to hasten the triumph of the former and<br>  crush and extirpate the latter, and as sure as God is good so sure will he<br>  cause them to prosper.<br></p><p>  Again you say, “If the blacks are to be benefitted at all, it can only be<br>  accomplished by the aid of the Colonization Society, and their removal to<br>  Africa.” O that you had spared the penning of that sentence! What principle do<br>  you mean to advocate? Into what would you convert our happy land? What, sir,<br>  shall we think of the man, professing to be governed by that religion which<br>  commands us to love our neighbor as ourselves, who tells us that here are two<br>  and a half millions of immortal beings among us, degraded and wretched, and if<br>  they “are to be benefitted at all” it must be by “their removal to Africa?”<br>  What, in the name of God, is the reason they cannot be benefitted here? What<br>  but that you and some of your brother editors are so wickedly prejudiced<br>  against them that you are determined they<br>  <em>shall not be?</em>  They<br>  <em>can</em>  be benefitted here—they<br>  <em>will</em>  be benefitted here. The number of blacks in this country will never be less<br>  than at the present moment—for in the first place we have not the means to<br>  make them less, increasing as they do 70,000 per year, and in the second place<br>  if we had the means of carrying them to Africa they do not want to go. They<br>  must always remain with us unless we serve them as we have served the poor<br>  Indians, and though you may continue to assert that they must always remain<br>  degraded, yet ever true Christian will rejoice that God in his good providence<br>  has ordered it otherwise.<br></p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>  JUSTICE.<br></p>",

The corner-stone upon which they founded the TEMPLE OF FREEDOM<br>  was broadly this—“that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by<br>  their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life,<br>  LIBERTY, and the pursuit of happiness.” At the sound of their trumpet-call,<br>  three millions of people rose up as from the sleep of death, and rushed to the<br>  strife of blood; deeming it more glorious to die instantly as freemen, than<br>  desirable to live one hour as slaves.—They were few in number—poor in<br>  resources; but the honest conviction that Truth and Justice, were on their<br>  side, made them invincible.<br></p><p>  We have met together for the achievement of an enterprise, without which, that<br>  of our fathers is incomplete, and which, for its magnitude, solemnity, and<br>  probable results upon the destiny of the world, as far transcends theirs, as<br>  moral truth does physical force.<br></p><p>  In purity of motive, in earnestness of zeal, in decision of purpose, in<br>  intrepidity of action, in stead fastness of faith, in sincerity of spirit, we<br>  would not be inferior to them.<br></p><p>  <em>Their</em>  principles led them to wage war against their oppressors, and to spill human<br>  blood like water, in order to be free.<br>  <em>Ours</em>  forbid the doing of evil that good may come, and lead us to reject, the use of<br>  all carnal weapons for deliverance from bondage—relying solely upon those<br>  which are spiritual, and mighty through God to the pulling down of strong<br>  holds.<br></p><p>  <em>Their</em>  measures were physical resistance—the marshalling in arms—the hostile<br>  array—the mortal encounter.<br>  <em>Ours</em>  shall be such only as the opposition of moral purity to moral corruption—the<br>  destruction of error by the potency of truth—the overthrow of prejudice by the<br>  power of love—and the abolition of slavery by the spirit of repentance.<br></p><p>  <em>Their</em>  grievances, great as they were, were trifling in comparison with the wrongs<br>  and sufferings of those for whom we plead. Our fathers were never slaves—never<br>  bought and sold like cattle—never shut out from the light of knowledge and<br>  religion—never subjected to the lash of brutal taskmasters.<br></p><p>  But those, for whose emancipation we are striving, —constituting at the<br>  present time at least one-sixth part of our countrymen, are recognized by the<br>  laws, and treated by their fellow beings, as marketable commodities—as goods<br>  and chattels—as brute beasts—are plundered daily of the fruits of their toil<br>  without redress;—really enjoy no constitutional nor legal protection from<br>  licentious and murderous outrages upon their persons;—are ruthlessly torn<br>  asunder—the tender babe from the arms of its frantic mother—the heart-broken<br>  wife from her weeping husband—at the caprice or pleasure of irresponsible<br>  tyrants;—and, for the crime of having a dark complexion, suffer the pangs of<br>  hunger, the infliction of stripes, and the ignominy of brutal servitude. They<br>  are kept in heathenish darkness by laws expressly enacted to make their<br>  instruction a criminal offence.<br></p><p>  These are the prominent circumstances in the condition of more than TWO<br>  MILLIONS of our people, proof of which may be found in thousands of<br>  indisputable facts, and in the laws of the slaveholding States.<br></p><p>Hence we maintain—</p><p>  That in view of the civil and religious privileges of this nation, the guilt<br>  of its oppression is unequalled by any other on the face of the earth;—and,<br>  therefore,<br></p><p>  That it is bound to repent instantly, to undo the heavy burden, to break every<br>  yoke, and let the oppressed go free.<br></p><p>We farther maintain—</p><p>  That no man has a right to enslave or imbrute his brother—to hold or<br>  acknowledge him, for one moment, as a piece of merchandise—to keep back his<br>  hire by fraud—or to brutalize his mind by denying him the means of<br>  intellectual, social and moral improvement.<br></p><p>  The right to enjoy liberty is inalienable. To invade it, is to usurp the<br>  prerogative of Jehovah. Every man has a right to his own body—to the products<br>  of his own labor—to the protection of law—and to the common advantages of<br>  society. It is piracy to buy or steal a native African and subject him to<br>  servitude. Surely the sin is as great to enslave an American as an African.<br></p><p>Therefore we believe and affirm—</p><p>  That there is no difference,<br>  <em>in principle,</em>  between the African slave trade and American slavery;<br></p><p>  That every American citizen, who retains a human being in involuntary bondage,<br>  is [according to Scripture] a MAN-STEALER;<br></p><p>  That the slaves ought instantly to be set free, and brought under the<br>  protection of law;<br></p><p>  That if they had lived from the time of Pharaoh down to the present period,<br>  and had been entailed through successive generations, their right to be free<br>  could never have been alienated, but their claims would have constantly risen<br>  in solemnity;<br></p><p>  That all those laws which are not in force, admitting the right of slavery,<br>  are therefore before God utterly null and void, being an audacious usurpation<br>  of the Divine prerogative, a daring infringement on the law of nature, a base<br>  overthrow of the very foundations of the social compact, a complete extinction<br>  of all the relations, endearments and obligations of mankind, and a<br>  presumptuous transgression of all the holy commandments—and that therefore<br>  they ought to be instantly abrogated.<br></p><p>We further believe and affirm—</p><p>  That all persons of color who possess the qualifications which are demanded of<br>  others, ought to be admitted forthwith to the enjoyment of the same<br>  privileges, and the exercise of the same prerogatives, as others; and that the<br>  paths of preferment, of wealth. and of intelligence, shall be opened as widely<br>  to them as to persons of a white complexion.<br></p><p>  We maintain that no compensation should be given to the planters emancipating<br>  their slaves—<br></p><p>  Because it would be a surrender of the great fundamental principle that man<br>  cannot hold property in man;<br></p><p>  Because<br>  <em>Slavery is a crime, and therefore is not an article to be sold;</em></p><p>  Because the holders of slaves are not the just proprietors of what they claim;<br>  freeing the slaves is not depriving them of property, but restoring it to the<br>  right owner; —it is not wronging the master, but righting the slave—restoring<br>  him to himself;<br></p><p>  Because immediate and general emancipation would only destroy nominal, not<br>  real property it would not amputate a limb or break a bone of the slaves, but<br>  by infusing motives into their breasts, would make them doubly valuable to the<br>  masters as free laborers; and<br></p><p>  Because if compensation is to be given at all, it should be given to the<br>  outraged and guiltless slaves, and not to those who have plundered and abused<br>  them.<br></p><p>  We regard, as delusive, cruel and dangerous, any scheme of expatriation which<br>  pretends to aid, either directly or indirectly, in the emancipation of the<br>  slaves, or to be a substitute for the immediate and total abolition of<br>  slavery.<br></p><p>  We fully and unanimously recognize the sovereignty of each State, to legislate<br>  exclusively on the subject of the slavery which is tolerated within its<br>  limits. We concede that Congress, under the present national compact, has no<br>  right to interfere with any of the slave states, in relation to this momentous<br>  subject.<br></p><p>  But we maintain that Congress has a right, and is solemnly bound, to suppress<br>  the domestic slave trade between the several States, and to abolish slavery in<br>  those portions of our territory which the Constitution has placed under its<br>  exclusive jurisdiction.<br></p><p>  We also maintain that there are, at the present time, the highest obligations<br>  resting upon the people of the free States, to remove slavery by moral and<br>  political action, as prescribed in the Constitution of United States. They are<br>  now living under a pledge of their tremendous physical force to fasten the<br>  galling fetters of tyranny upon the limbs of millions in the southern<br>  States;—they are liable to be called at any moment to suppress a general<br>  insurrection of the slaves;—they authorize the slave owner to vote for<br>  three-fifths of his slaves as property, and thus enable him to perpetuate his<br>  oppression;—they support a standing army at the south for its protection;—and<br>  they seize the slave who has escaped into their territories, and send him back<br>  to be tortured by an enraged master or a brutal driver.<br></p><p>  This relation to slavery is criminal and full of danger:<br>  <em>it must be broken up.</em></p><p>  These are our views and principles—these, our designs and measures. With<br>  entire confidence in the overruling justice of God, we plant ourselves upon<br>  the Declaration of our Independence, and upon the truth of Divine Revelation,<br>  as upon the Everlasting Rock.<br></p><p>  We shall organize Anti-Slavery Societies, if possible, in every city, town and<br>  village of our land.<br></p><p>  We shall send forth Agents to lift up the voice of remonstrance, of warning of<br>  entreaty and rebuke.<br></p><p>  We shall circulate, unsparingly and extensively, anti slavery tracts and<br>  periodicals.<br></p><p>  We shall enlist the Pulpit and the Press in the cause of the suffering and the<br>  dumb.<br></p><p>  We shall aim at a purification of the churches from all participation in the<br>  guilt of slavery.<br></p><p>  We shall encourage the labor of freemen over that of the slaves, by giving a<br>  preference to their productions;—and<br></p><p>  We shall spare no exertions nor means to bring the whole nation to speedy<br>  repentance.<br></p><p>  Our trust for victory is solely in GOD.<br>  <em>We</em>  may be personally defeated, but our principles never. TRUTH, JUSTICE, and<br>  HUMANITY, must and will gloriously triumph. Already a host is coming up to the<br>  help of the Lord against the mighty, and the prospect before us is full of<br>  encouragement.<br></p><p>  Submitting this DECLARATION to the candid examination of the people of this<br>  country, and of the friends of liberty all over the world, we hereby affix our<br>  signatures to it; pledging ourselves that, under the guidance and by the help<br>  of Almighty God, we will do all that in us lies, consistently with this<br>  Declaration of our principles, to overthrow the most execrable system of<br>  slavery that has ever been witnessed upon earth—to deliver our land from its<br>  deadliest curse—to wipe out the foulest stain which rests upon our national<br>  escutcheon—and to secure to the colored population of the United States all<br>  the rights and privileges which belong to them as men and as Americans—come<br>  what may to our persons, our interests, or our reputations—whether we live to<br>  witness the triumph of Justice, Liberty and Humanity, or perish untimely as<br>  martyrs in this great, benevolent, and holy cause.<br></p><p>  David<br>  Thurston,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>  B.

    "commentary": "There is much to add, relevant to The Unionist and the Canterbury Female Academy, to this Declaration. <p>  In the same issue of <em>The Abolitionist</em> that printed the Declaration, African-American delegate Robert Purvis delivered an encomium for William Lloyd Garrison:<br>  <em>The Abolitionist</em>  1:12:183 (December 1833)<br></p><p>In a pair of motions intimately related to the Canterbury Female Academy, the convention expressed its appreciation of education in general, and Canterbury in particular.</p><p>\"On motion of Simeon S. Jocelyn, seconded by Amos A. Phelps, it was</p><p>  Resolved.&nbsp; That the fountains of knowledge, like those of salvation,<br>  should be open to every creature, and that we regard those laws and prejudices<br>  which prevent or restrict the education of the people of color, bond or free,<br>  as pre-eminently cruel and impious, and disgraceful to a christian state or<br>  nation; and that we will seek their abolishment, both in the free and slave<br>  States, if possible more earnestly than corporeal slavery itself, in as much<br>  as ignorance enslaves the mind, and tends to the ruin of the immortal soul.<br></p><p>On motion of John Prentice, seconded by William Goodell, it was</p><p>  Resolved, That this convention highly approve of the philanthropic effort of<br>  Miss Prudence Crandall of Canterbury, Conn. in her labors to instruct our<br>  colored sisters; and while we deeply sympathize with her in view of the<br>  persecutions she has endured in the prosecution of her pious purposes, we<br>  pledge ourselves to afford her our continued countenance and assistance\"<br>  <em>The Abolitionist</em>  1:12:184 (December 1833) Goodell was the editor of <em>The Genius of Temperance</em>; Jocelyn and Phelps were both endorsers of the Canterbury Female Academy.<br></p><p>  <em>The Abolitionist</em> in that same December issue also published a letter from Charles Stuart to William Lloyd Garrison, that <br>  made reference also to letters from Buffum and<br>  Forten: \"Many hearts are beating here for the glorious Prudence<br>  Crandall. Some of my young friends are working little parcels of<br>  presents for me to take to her dear pupils in the Spring.\" (written from<br>  Liverpool)<br></p><p>  Samuel Joseph May and John G. Whittier worked with the principal author, William Lloyd Garrison, on the 1833 Declaration of Sentiments of the American Anti-Slavery Society. The language of the Declaration, and the sense of who was behind it, demonstrates how nonviolence already held some prominence in the movement at the time of the Canterbruy Female Academy. Furthermore, they were working at the home of African-American activist and dentist James McCrummell (Benjamin Quarles, <em>Black Abolitionists</em> New York: Da Capo Press, 1991; original edition 1969, p. vii-viii) <br></p>",

It would not be safe to obey the<br>  command of God NOW—wait, and let us leave off sinning by degrees and make a<br>  compromise with God that will leave us in our sins a few years longer.

    "commentary": "G. Tillotson was Rev. George Jeffrey Tillotson (1805-1888), Congregational minister of Brooklyn Connecticut. He was the minister who agreed to officiate the marriage of Prudence Crandall and Calvin Philleo, when the Congregational minister of Canterbury declined on the day of the wedding. He had begun his ministerial career in Brooklyn with the Execution Sermon for Oliver Watkins, the murderer whose cell in the Brooklyn Jail later housed Prudence Crandall. For the text of that sermon, see <em>Windham County Advertiser</em>, 5:52 (August 2, 1831), p. 3. Tillotson had a personal friendship with Abolitionist and Crandall endorser Amos A. Phelps; see the collection of letters digitized here: - https://www.digitalcommonwealth.org/search?f%5Bname_facet_ssim%5D%5B%5D=Tillotson%2C+George+Jeffrey%2C+1805-1888 . After the Civil War, he donated substantially to an institution of higher learning for Freedmen in Austin, Texas, which was named the Tillotson Institute in his honor - https://www.pvamu.edu/tiphc/wp-content/uploads/sites/107/GeorgeTillotson.pdf . The school still exists today, as Huston-Tillotson University , an HBCU in Austin.

The S.C.<br>  delegation had heard, with deep regret, of the death of their colleague, the<br>  Hon. Thomas D. Singleton, and it was his painful duty to communicate that<br>  mournful information to the House. He died at Raleigh, whilst on his journey<br>  to the Capitol, whither he was hastening to assume his seat, and to discharge<br>  his duties, as a member of this body. ****<br></p><p>  With these few remarks, which he had felt it his duty to submit, in justice to<br>  the character of one whose memory deserved a far better tribute than any he<br>  could offer, he now proposed the following resolutions for the consideration<br>  of the House;<br></p><p>  Resolved, That we have received, with deep regret, the melancholy intelligence<br>  of the death of the Hon.

As well might I be required to<br>  detail to the Senate the free and private conversations I have held with those<br>  officers on any subject relating to their duties and my own.<br>  <br />  Feeling my responsibility to the American people, I am willing upon all<br>  occasions to explain to them the grounds of my conduct, and I am willing upon<br>  all proper occasions to give to either branch of the Legislature any<br>  information in my possession that can be useful in the execution of the<br>  appropriate duties confided to them.<br>  <br />  Knowing the constitutional rights of the Senate, I shall be the last man under<br>  any circumstances to interfere with them. Knowing those of the Executive, I<br>  shall at all times endeavor to maintain them agreeably to the provisions of<br>  the Constitution and the solemn oath I have taken to support and defend it.<br>  <br />  I am constrained, therefore, by a proper sense of my own self-respect and of<br>  the rights secured by the Constitution to the executive branch of the<br>  Government to decline a compliance with your request. ANDREW JACKSON<br></p><p>After the message had been read,</p><p>  Mr Clay said, that a call had been made on the President for a copy of a<br>  document which has been published and extensively circulated by the papers in<br>  this city—a document intimately connected with the safety of the treasure of<br>  the country. The call for it was made under the full conviction that the Senate<br>  ought to have that document. It had been refused, under the pretext that the<br>  rights of the Chief Magistrate were invaded by it. He always would be disposed<br>  to respect the rights of every public officer, but the President could have no<br>  more confidence in his rights, then I feel in the rights of the Senate. The<br>  right of the Senate to call for this paper was founded on the ground that the<br>  whole world was already in possession of it. It was made because the document<br>  was sent forth to the American people upon an all-important subject, and<br>  because it was the right of the Senate to have it. Nor was it made because the<br>  call was in violation of precedent or an established usage. But the President<br>  has refused to give us this document, and it was not necessary to proceed<br>  further in the pursuit. One result happens from it. The President don’t deny<br>  the genuineness of the paper. It is before the world, and as we have endeavored<br>  to get it, and it has been refused, I have a right to take the next best<br>  evidence of the document, and that is as it has been published in the official<br>  paper. In every instance, therefore, where I have occasion to use it, I shall<br>  avail myself of that publication of it, as genuine.<br></p><p>  Mr Grundy said he thought when the proposition was made, that it was a very<br>  unnecessary procedure.<br></p><p>  Here the presiding office interposed that the debate was out of order unless<br>  some motion was intended to be made.<br></p><p>  Mr Grundy said he intended to love, before he concluded, that the message be<br>  laid on the table; and then resumed—<br></p><p>  That he thought it unnecessary, because we only wanted evidence when facts had<br>  not come to our knowledge, or when they are denied.—Now, he believed that both<br>  friends and enemies admitted this document to be genuine—to be what it<br>  purported to be. He therefore had thought that nothing beneficial could result<br>  from this proposition, and this was what induced him to vote against it. The<br>  President has given his objection to complying with the call, and what is it?<br>  Why, that the Senate has asked for a private communication from the Chief<br>  Magistrate to his Cabinet. He, [Mr. G.} would never question the propriety of<br>  the motives of the Senator who wanted this information. But the President has.<br>  <em>Note: Clay was a former nominee for the office of the President</em></p><p align=\"center\">IN SENATE.</p><p align=\"right\">WEDNESDAY, December 11, 1833.</p><p>  Mr Bibb, pursuant to notice given, presented certain joint resolutions<br>  providing or an alteration in the Constitution of the United States, in<br>  relation to the mode of electing the President, and Vice President, and then<br>  moved to lay the same on the table and print them. Mr. B. said he felt no<br>  disposition to press the consideration of the resolutions now, and therefore<br>  moved that the second Monday in January next be assigned for taking them up,<br>  and also the resolutions offered by Mr. Benton somedays since, on the same<br>  subject, at the same time; which was agreed to.<br></p><p>  Mr Clay moved the consideration of Mr Benton’s resolution, relative to the<br>  amount of moneys in deposite [sic] at particular periods in the Bank of the<br>  United States.<br></p><p><em>Apparently a line is missing here</em></p><p>  Said that it is a matter which you have no right to interrogate him about;<br>  and his opinion is, too, that to comply with the request would be setting a<br>  dangerous precedent. He [Mr G.] was not inclined to sat any thing on the<br>  subject of the removal of the deposits, when that matter should come up for<br>  consideration. But if he did, he could not, even if he were so disposed, speak<br>  of that paper as any other than a genuine one, or deny its authenticity.

This publication has been always<br>  distinguished for its beautiful engravings of the Fashions, but it is the<br>  intention of the proprietors to render the one for January still more splendid<br>  than the previous ones. The public will perceive that, without heralding it by<br>  professions, a reference to past experience is the best promise of future<br>  exertions, which it shall be the publishers’ study to render both prompt and<br>  pleasing.<br></p>",

In the early 1820s Goodrich came to the conclusion that children as well as adults preferred to read truth rather than fancy and that it would be possible to present history, geography, science, etc. ( truth) in such a way that it would be more interesting to children than fairies, giants and monsters. Based on this conclusion Goodrich moved his business to Boston and Peter Parley was born in 1827 with PETER PARLEY'S TALES ABOUT AMERICA. Goodrich expanded his publishing efforts to textbooks and magazines. His publications were so popular that he attracted imposters, particularly in England. Spurious Peter Parleys appeared everywhere, infuriating Goodrich, but he did not succeed in putting an end to them.\" from Contextual Notes at https://digitalcollections.lib.washington.edu/digital/collection/childrens/id/460/rec/9",

    "commentary": "Charles Backus Storrs (1794-1833) was the first President of Case-Western Reserve University in Cleveland. This poem can also be found on Poem Hunter: https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/to-the-memory-of-charles-b-storrs/ . In addition to the poetic memorial from Whittier, there is this account from Henry Wilson of Storrs' deathbed testimony: \"Rev. Amos A. Phelps of Massachusetts earnestly supported the resolution. He referred in words of tender eulogy to the Rev. Charles B. Storrs, late president of the Western Reserve College, who had recently died at Braintree, Massachusetts. He stated that Mr. Storrs, while lying on his death-bed, requested that a pen should be placed in his hands, that he might affix his name to a declaration of antislavery principles about to be issued. \"He commenced,\" said Mr. Phelps, “tracing his name, and had written the first word, 'Charles,' when he discovered that two of the letters had been transposed. Letting the pen fall, and turning to his brother, standing by, he exclaimed, with an energy peculiar to him: 'I can write no more: Brother, do you finish my name. Those principles are eternal truth. They cannot be shaken. I wish to give to them my dying testimony.'\" Mr. Phelps expressed the opinion that the death of President Storrs had been hastened by over-exertion in delivering an address of great vigor and power of more than two hours in length, in behalf of the slave. Mr. Storrs was a gentleman of high promise and scholarship, of Christian principle and earnest philanthropy, in whose untimely death freedom lost one of its earliest and ablest champions. The touching scene at his death-bed is one among the evidences that the antislavery struggle in this country was born of a zeal and heroic devotion to principle which finds not many parallels in the world's history\" (“National Antislavery Convention at Philadelphia: Organization of the American Antislavery Society,” by Henry Wilson, in <em>History of the Rise and Fall of the Slave Power in America</em>, 1872, accessed http://www.americanabolitionists.com/american-anti-slavery-society.html",

    "transcription": "<p align=\"center\">  SIXTH REPORT OF THE AMERICAN<br>  <strong>TEMPERANCE SOCIETY</strong>  ,<br></p><p align=\"center\"><em>Continued</em></p><p>  IV. Laws which authorize the licensing of men to traffic in ardent spirit,<br>  violate the first principles of political economy, and are highly injurious to<br>  the wealth of a nation.<br></p><p>  The wealth of a nation consists of the wealth of all the individuals that<br>  compose it. The sources of wealth are labor, land, and capital. The last is<br>  indeed the product of the two former; but as it may be used to increase their<br>  value, it is considered by writers on political economy, as one of the<br>  original sources of national wealth. Whatever lessons either of these, or<br>  their productiveness when employed upon each other, lessens the wealth of the<br>  country. Capital may be employed in two ways; either to produce new capital,<br>  or merely to afford gratification, and in the production of that gratification<br>  he consumed, without repealing its value. The first may be called capital, and<br>  the last expenditure. These will of course bear inverse proportions to each<br>  other. If the first be large, the last must be small, and vice versa. Without<br>  any change of the amount of wealth, capital will be increased by the lessened<br>  by the increase of expenditure. Although the manner of dividing makes no<br>  difference with the present amount of national wealth, it makes great<br>  difference with the future amount; as it alters materially the sources of<br>  producing it, the means of an equal, or increased reproduction.<br></p><p>  For instance, a man fond of noise and excited agreeably by the hearing of it,<br>  pays a dollar for gunpowder, and touches fire to it. He occasions an entire<br>  loss of that amount of property. Although the powder maker and the merchant,<br>  may both have received their pay, if it has not benefitted the man, to him it<br>  has been a total loss; and if the sale of it was more profitable than would<br>  have been the sale of some useful article, it has been an entire loss to the<br>  community. And if by the explosion the man is burnt, partially loses his<br>  reason, is taken off a time from business, and confined by sickness to his<br>  bed, must have nurses, physicians, &amp;c. the loss is still increased. And if<br>  he never recovers fully his health, or reason, suffers his social affections<br>  and moral sensibility, becomes less faithful in the education of his children,<br>  and they are more exposed to temptation and ruin, and he is never again as<br>  able or willing to be habitually employed in productive labor, the nation<br>  loses equal to the amount of all these put together. And if his example leads<br>  other men to spend, and to suffer in the same way, the loss is still farther<br>  increased; and so on, through all its effects.<br></p><p>  And even though the powder maker and the merchant have made enormous profit,<br>  this does not prevent the loss to the community; any more than the profit of<br>  lottery gamblers, or counterfeiters of the public coin, prevents loss to the<br>  community. Nor does it meet the case, to say that the property changes hands.<br>  This is not true. The man who sold the powder made a profit of only a part<br>  even of the money which the other man paid for it; while he lost not only the<br>  whole, but vastly more. The whole of the original cost was only a small part<br>  of the loss to the buyer, and for the nation. The merchant gained nothing of<br>  the time, and other numerous expenses, which the buyer lost; nor does he in<br>  any way remunerate the community for that loss.<br></p><p>  Suppose that man, instead of buying the powder, had bought a pair of shoes;<br>  and that the tanner and the shoemaker had gained in this case, what the<br>  powder-maker and the merchant gained in the other; and that by the use of the<br>  shoes, though they were finally worn out, the man gained twice as much as he<br>  gave for them; without any loss of health, or reason, social affection, or<br>  moral susceptibility; and without any of the consequent evils.—Who cannot see<br>  that it would have increased his wealth, and that of the nation, without<br>  injury to any, and have promoted the benefit of all.<br></p><p>  This illustrates the principle with regard to ardent spirit. A man buys a<br>  quantity of it, and drinks it; when he would be, as the case with every man,<br>  in all respects better without it. It is to him an entire loss. The merchant<br>  may have made a profit of one quarter of the cost, but the buyer loses the<br>  whole; and he loses the time employed in obtaining and drinking it. He loses,<br>  also, and the community loses, equal to all its deteriorating effects upon his<br>  body and mind, his children, and all who come under his influence. His land<br>  becomes less productive. The capital of course produced by this land and labor<br>  is diminished; and thus the means are diminished of future reproduction. And<br>  by the increase of expenditure in proportion to the capital, it is still<br>  farther diminished, till to meet the increasingly disproportionate expenses,<br>  the whole is often taken, and the means of future reproduction are entirely<br>  exhausted. And if there is no seed to sow, there is of course no future<br>  harvest. This is but a simple history of what is taking in thousands of cases<br>  continually; and of what is the tendency of the traffic in ardent spirit from<br>  beginning to end. It lessens the productiveness of land and labor, and of<br>  course diminishes the amount of capital; while in proportion, it increases the<br>  expenditure, and thus in both ways is constantly exhausting the means of<br>  future production. And this is its tendency, in all its bearing, in proportion<br>  to the quantity used, from the man who takes only his glass, to the man who<br>  takes his quart a day. It is a palpable and gross violation of all correct<br>  principles of political economy; and from beginning to end, tends to diminish<br>  all the sources of national wealth.<br></p>",

This particular excerpt buttresses my published contention that the students at the Canterbury Female Academy were reading advanced philosophy. While I disagree with the political economic analysis forwarded here, it is sophisticated for its time.

[sic<br>  no close parentheses]<br></p><p>  IN consequence of the light poured on the public, and the church, by the<br>  spirited exertions of philanthropic individuals, a great change, in relation<br>  to intoxicating liquors, has been produced. The eye, heart, and hand of<br>  christian faith looks, prays, and acts for its completion.<br></p><p>  But another reformation is needed in the church. It must be as separate from<br>  slavery, as from intemperance. The nation groans under the burden and misery<br>  and guilt of both these sins. It is the solemn duty of the church to clear<br>  itself from both these tremendous crimes. This is not addressed to the world,<br>  for the world legalizes the traffic in rum, and in the bodies and souls of<br>  men. But it is addressed to the children of God, who, if they know and do<br>  their duty, can have no possible connection with either of these trades. If<br>  increasing light has shown that christians ought not to buy and sell ardent<br>  spirits, much more it is believed, will increasing light show that christians<br>  ought not to buy human beings.<br></p><p>  The Rev John Newton, even after he became pious, transported Africans in<br>  chains across the Atlantic, to be sold with their posterity into slavery.<br>  Could he have been a true christian, and have no upbraidings of conscience<br>  while so engaged? Yes. How is it possible? It was legal, and, at that time,<br>  honorable, and his mind was not enlightened.—Afterwards when it was he<br>  lamented his error. So there are in our country those who buy and sell their<br>  fellow beings, who, if their minds were enlightened, would lament and<br>  relinquish it.<br></p><p>  A few years ago, a man, whose whole daily earnings were required by his<br>  family, set up forty nights to run a distillery for forty dollars, which he<br>  gave to build a house of worship.—How could he think that money obtained by<br>  changing the bread of the poor, into the liquid fire of death, acceptable to<br>  God? Because his mind was in darkness. Would he do it now? No. Neither would<br>  the church now receive it. Why? Because the light of the temperance<br>  reformation has burst forth.<br></p><p>  Christians! who have promised supreme obedience to Him, that :tasted death for<br>  every man,: and more for the rich man, who, in a superb dress, rides in a<br>  superb carriage, to a superb church, to worship in superb style, than for the<br>  poor African, who pulls cotton in the “fields of Alabama, and naked as in the<br>  hour of birth, trembles under the blasts of mid winter”—on you is this call<br>  for a reformation in the church of that God, who declares himself no respector<br>  [sic] of persons.—Why do you exclude the dealer in ardent spirits from the<br>  communion table, and invite to it the dealer in human flesh? This could not,<br>  would not be, if there had been half so much effort made to show the utter<br>  abominations of christian slavery, as there has been to show the abominations<br>  of christian drunkenness. Whatever maybe the event of slavery and intemperance<br>  in the world a sufficiency of light will show, and cause to be removed<br>  these&nbsp; shocking deformities of the christian church. One denomination has<br>  already raised thousands of dollars to assist their brethren in becoming free<br>  from the deep stains of this awful sin. When will other denominations be<br>  equally sincere and active to cleanse themselves from this pollution? The<br>  answer is plain. When they are as conscientious and as much enlightened.<br></p><p>  To have light poured on this subject as its importance demands, it is proposed<br>  to raise fifty dollars, as a premium for the best essay on this deeply<br>  interesting subject. When the church if pure, we may then expect the smiles<br>  and approbation of heaven on our now almost divided land. And oh! May none<br>  refuse their mite to reward the close application of time and talents to this<br>  most vitally important theme; for it is believed the temperance reformation<br>  commenced in this way.<br></p><p>  Donations will be received by the Editors of the Genius of Temperance, and the<br>  Editor of the Emancipator, 126, Nassau street, A part of the money has already<br>  been raised by a few ladies in Massachusetts. It is hoped that others, who are<br>  opposed to slavery in the church of Christ, will speedily forward enough to<br>  make it up to $50, when the sum will be given to him who shall show most<br>  conclusively to the christian church and to christian ministers, their duty to<br>  “Break every yoke.” The essays which shall be written for the prize, are to be<br>  judged, and the premium awarded, by ________<br></p><p>[N.B.—The blank will be filled, when the money is subscribed.]</p>",

    "commentary": "Philip Pearl Jr. has a checkered history in the saga of the Canterbury Female Academy. His daughter Hannah attended the first version of the Academy, before the change to Black students. Philip Pearl Jr. was an elected legislator who helped to draft the law in 1833, and lobbied it through the Assembly. He was perceived as Andrew Judson's most important ally in Connecticut state politics. However, he was converted to anti-slavery by Theodore Dwight Weld, and in 1837 led the effort to repeal the Black Law! On the petition from his town of Hampton, he signed the petition at the top in bold pen. Petitions re: Repeal of Act Prohibiting Education of Colored Persons RG002, Box 26 General Assembly Papers 1837-1838, folder #16, document 14.",

Their paper<br>  (the Unionist) aside from its practical character, appears to be conducted<br>  with much discernment. Its junior editor, Mr. Wm. Burleigh was taught the<br>  rudiments of printing by ourself—and notwithstanding his disobedience caused<br>  us to discharge him form our employ, yet commands our respect.

Thus, by<br>  her false insinuations, she deprived her of the esteem of the world—that world<br>  which will on day<br>  <em>worship</em>  and the next<br>  <em>stab</em>  you. Not contented with this, she persuaded Mr. Minnette to disinherit his<br>  daughter, and make a will in favor of the little George, but her cruelty was<br>  not to go unpunished. By some unforeseen losses in trade Mr. Minnette became<br>  bankrupt, and was obliged to sell his splendid establishment in —— street, and<br>  remove to a small house which belonged to Emily’s mother, and which was the<br>  only property he could not be deprived of. But to return to Emily.<br></p><p>  The picture of former days would sometimes rise, and appear like a fairy<br>  dream, from which she had been too soon awakened. She thought of the kind<br>  mother who had been ever ready to gratify her childish wishes—and of Edward,<br>  too, she thought much. Would he believe his sister’s falsehoods? was a<br>  question that often perplexed her. And were there no mingling of resentment in<br>  these recollections? Not any. Her heart had been taught a better discipline.<br></p><p>  Two years passed away, and Emily found peace, if not happiness. She was now<br>  twenty-one years old, and it was in her power to retaliate her injuries, by<br>  turning her father out of her house, which was now in her possession; but<br>  instead of this she wrote a long and kind letter, entreating him to occupy it<br>  as long as he wished.<br></p><p>  Having but little to engage her attention, Emily offered to teach a school for<br>  the children of the village. For this purpose, a room was fitted up in a small<br>  light building, erected near the river for the convenience of washing. During<br>  her residence with her kind aunt, it had been her favorite care to ornament<br>  and improve it. She had planted all around it the rose of cassia, jessamine,<br>  honeysuckle and grape vines. Their mingled blossoms and intertwining branches<br>  formed a luxuriant drapery, which soon became one mass of living verdure. From<br>  this little nest of flowers, an avenue, shaded by old elms, led down to the<br>  river, whose smooth surface was broken into ripples by the dipping branches of<br>  the weeping willow, as its waters went sparkling and gleaming along in their<br>  noiseless beauty. Here, in pleasant weather, Emily often ranged her scholars,<br>  in the open air; and then there were bright eyes and happy faces, for children<br>  do not love the confinement of a school room. The exercises of the day were<br>  generally concluded with a hymn and prayer, in which all were taught to join.<br></p><p>  It was near the close of a delightful day in June, and their melodious voices<br>  were just breaking the stillness of that beautiful solitude, when a gentleman,<br>  attracted by the sound, came to the opposite bank, and, concealed by the<br>  shade, listened with intense delight to the infant warblers.<br></p><p>  The last note died away, and a solemn pause ensued. “Now, my dear little<br>  children,” said Emily, “will you join me, with your whole hearts, in a prayer<br>  to our Heavenly Father who has watched over and protected us through the day.”<br>  She then kneeled down on the green earth, and was soon encircled by her cherub<br>  band of scholars, who also knelt and softly repeated, after their youthful<br>  instructress, The Lord’s Prayer. Then came the fervent “amen”—“Amen!” repeated<br>  their innocent lips, and “Amen!” echoed the green hills. Then, slowly, they<br>  all arose, kissed Emily, one by one, crossed the little bridge, and<br>  disappeared.<br></p><p>  But the stranger yet remained. It was Edward Brumiere, once the friend of<br>  Emily—and if he had ever doubted her, could he any longer question the<br>  goodness and purity of the beautiful being before him? It was impossible. A<br>  moment, and he was at her side. Surprise deepened the rose on her cheek, and<br>  she confessed the pleasure she felt in again meeting him. She extended her<br>  hand to him with a cordial smile, for she had not yet learned to hide her<br>  feelings under the mask of indifference.<br></p><p>  “I come from your father, my dear Emily. He is not very well, and feels the<br>  want of your kindness and good nursing.”<br></p><p>  “But where is my ———mother?” she enquired, hesitatingly. “She is obliged to<br>  divide her attentions between him and your little brother, who has been<br>  sometime ill, of a lingering complaint, which they fear will terminate in a<br>  consumption. But are you quite willing to forget your resentment?” “I have<br>  none.” “Your injuries then?” “I freely forgive them as I hope to be forgiven.”<br></p><p>  “Do you know their extent? Driven from your home, calumniated, disinherited,<br>  by one who pledged herself your friend.”<br></p><p>  While enumerating these, he closely watched her countenance, and finding there<br>  no expression but forgiving love, he continued, “or do you not feel their<br>  force?” An unbidden tear fell down her cheek, silently refuting the charge of<br>  insensibility.<br></p><p>  Love sprung in his heart spontaneous; and tenderly taking her hand, he said<br>  with much emotion, “Amiable girl!—have you no connection with earth, that you<br>  have divested yourself of human passions and frailties.”<br></p><p>  “Afflictions have been sanctified to me, and have taught me that hatred and<br>  happiness cannot exist in the same bosom.”<br></p><p>  “Matilda is my sister; forgive me, Emily! I believed what she said of you! I<br>  could almost<br>  <em>hate</em>  her for<br>  <em>your</em>  sake, had you not given me a better example.”<br></p><p>  “It is perfectly natural to believe the assertions of those we love; but I<br>  hope my study may be to contradict the tongue of slander by my conduct. Anger<br>  so blinds our reason, that Matilda might imagine me the unkind, guilty<br>  creature she represents me. Thus saying, she led the way to the house, where<br>  she introduced Edward to her aunt.<br></p><p>The next morning found them at Mr. Minnette’s door.</p><p>  Edward remained in the parlor, that he might put no restraint upon the<br>  feelings of either party, while Emily was shown to her father’s room. She<br>  clung round his neck—he embraced her, and she once more felt happy in his<br>  returning love.<br></p><p>  The open door of an adjoining room discovered Matilda, bending over the bed of<br>  her sick child, with all a mother’s fondness in her looks. In her deep anxiety<br>  the predominant expression of unbending pride was lost; and instead, there<br>  seemed something like repentance, nay, even kindness as her eye rested on<br>  Emily.<br></p><p>  From this time, Emily divided her cares between her father and brother, and<br>  determined by her attentions to merit the love of her family. Perhaps she was<br>  more condescending than some, yet none thought her mean-spirited, or weak, or<br>  respected her the less; but all admired the forgiving spirit she displayed.<br></p><p>  Mr. Minnette soon recovered, which gave some reason to suspect that his<br>  disorder originated in remorse; and now, Emily transferred all her attentions<br>  to her suffering brother. She had, while with her aunt (who was the medical<br>  adviser of the whole village) acquired considerable knowledge of roots and<br>  herbs, and these she successfully employed in his recovery.<br></p><p>  Every day she carried the sufferer out of doors in her arms for the benefit of<br>  exercise and fresh air, of which Matilda, by a mistake in the art of nursing,<br>  had deprived him. He soon felt the good effect of the change, and the<br>  delighted mother saw once more the glow of health upon his cheek, and<br>  returning activity in his tiny limbs.<br></p><p>  Matilda’s haughty spirit had been broken down by adversity, and Emily’s<br>  conduct had shamed “the offending spirit” out of her. Her understanding was<br>  naturally good, but it had been perverted by a faulty education, dictated by<br>  an injudiciously fond parent. A train of concurring circumstances roused her<br>  better feelings and they triumphed over the errors of education and the<br>  habitual follies of many years! and she bent before the altar of her God, a<br>  repentant woman and a humble and sincere christian. And now, from being the<br>  most wretched, they became, proverbially, the most united and happy family in<br>  New-York. Having performed her duties at home, Emily, according to promise,<br>  returned to her aunt, accompanied by Edward, who by the consent of all parties<br>  had become her betrothed husband.<br></p><p>  “Let us be married, Emily,” said he, “on the anniversary of the river scene;<br>  then I shall unite in one the two most interesting events of my life, my<br>  marriage and the event which led to it.”<br></p><p>  A year from that day, Emily became the wife of Edward—and each succeeding one<br>  finds her in the midst of love and happiness surrounded by her family of<br>  little ones, to whom Edward annually repeats the Tale of Forgiveness.<br></p>",

    "description": "An extended excerpt from the recently published <em>Essays on the Principles of Morality</em> by English Quaker philosopher Jonathan Dymond. The subtitle, all in caps, reads “POLITICAL POWER IS RIGHTLY EXERCISED ONLY WHEN IT SUBSERVES THE WELFARE OF COMMUNITY.” ",
    "source": "<em>The Unionist</em>",
    "subject": "Religion and Philosophy; Allied Reform Movements - Peace",
    "transcription": "<p align=\"center\"><strong>POLITICAL.</strong></p><p align=\"center\"><strong>———</strong></p><p align=\"center\">From Dymond’s Essays on Political Rights and Obligations</p><p align=\"center\">II.</p><p align=\"center\">  “POLITICAL POWER IS RIGHTLY EXERCISED ONLY WHEN IT SUBSERVES THE WELFARE OF<br>  COMMUNITY”<br></p><p>  This proposition is consequent of the truth of the last. The community which<br>  has the right to withhold power, delegates it, of course, for its own<br>  advantage. If in any case its advantage is not consulted, then the object for<br>  which it was delegated is frustrated—or in simple words, the measure which<br>  does not promote the public welfare is not right. It matters nothing whether<br>  the community have delegated specifically so much power for such and such<br>  purposes: the power,<br>  <em>being possessed,</em>  entails the obligation. Whether a sovereign derives absolute authority for a<br>  year, the principles of their duty are the same. The obligation to employ it<br>  only for the public good, is just as real and just as great in one case as in<br>  the other. The Russian and the Turk have the same right to require that the<br>  power of their rulers shall be so employed, as the Englishman or American.<br>  They may not be able to assert this right, but that does not affect its<br>  existence nor the ruler’s duty,—nor his responsibility to that<br>  <em>Almighty</em>  Being before whom he must give an account of his stewardship. These<br>  reasonings, if they needed confirmation, derive it from the fact that the<br>  Deity imperatively requires us, according to our opportunities, to<br>  <em>do good</em>  to man.<br></p><p>  But, how ready soever men are to admit the truth of this proposition as a<br>  proposition, it is very commonly disregarded in practice; and a vast variety<br>  of motives and objects direct the conduct of governments which have no<br>  connection with the public weal. Some<br>  <em>pretensions</em>  of consulting the public weal are, indeed, usual. It is not to be supposed<br>  that when public officers are pursuing their own schemes and interests, they<br>  will<br>  <em>tell</em>  the people that they disregarded theirs. When we look over the history of a<br>  christian nation, it is found that a large proportion of these measures which<br>  are most prominent in it, had little tendency to subserve, and did not<br>  subserve the public good. In practice it is very often forgotten for what<br>  purpose governments are instituted. If a man were to look over twenty<br>  treaties, he would probably find that half of them had very little to do with<br>  the welfare of the respective communities. He might find a great feal about<br>  Charles’ rights, and Frederick’s honor, and Louis’ possessions, and Francis’<br>  interests,—as if the proper subjects of international arrangements were those<br>  which respected rulers rather than communities. If a man looks over the state<br>  papers which inform him of the origin of a war, he will probably fund that<br>  they agitate questions about Most Christian and Most Catholic Kinds, and High<br>  Mightinesses, and Imperial Majesties,—questions, however, in which Frenchmen,<br>  and Spaniards, and Dutch, and Austrians, are very little interested or<br>  concerned, or at any rate much less interested than they are in avoiding the<br>  quarrel.<br></p><p>  Governments commonly trouble themselves unnecessarily and too much with the<br>  politics of other nations. A prince should turn his back towards other<br>  countries and his face towards his own,—just as the proper place of a<br>  landholder is upon his own estates and not upon his neighbor’s. If governments<br>  were wise, it would ere long be found, that a great portion of the endless and<br>  wearisome succession of treaties, and remonstrances, and embassies, and<br>  alliances, and memorials, and subsidies, might be dispensed with, with so<br>  little inconvenience, and so much benefit, that the world would wonder to<br>  think to what futile ends they had been busying and how needlessly they had<br>  been injuring themselves.<br></p><p>  No doubt, the immoral and irrational system of international politics which<br>  <em>generally</em>  obtains, makes the path of one government more difficult than it would<br>  otherwise be; and yet it is probable that the most efficacious way of inducing<br>  another government to attend to its proper business, would be to attend to our<br>  own. It is not sufficiently considered, nor indeed is it sufficiently<br>  <em>known</em>  , how powerful is the influence of uprightness and candor in conciliating the<br>  good officers of other men. Overreaching and chicanery in one person, induce<br>  overreaching and chicanery in another. Men distrust those whom they perceive<br>  to be unworthy of confidence. Real integrity is not without its vouched in the<br>  hearts of others; and they who maintain it are treated with confidence,<br>  because it is seen that confidence can be safely reposed. Besides, he who<br>  busies himself with the politics of foreign countries, like the busy bodies in<br>  a petty community does not fail to offend. In the last century, our own<br>  country was so much of a busy body, and had involved itself in such a<br>  multitude of treaties and alliances, that it was found, I believe, quite<br>  impossible to fulfil one without, by that very act, violating another. This,<br>  of course, would offend. In private life that man passes through the world<br>  with the least annoyance and the greatest satisfaction, who confines his<br>  attention to its proper business, that is, generally, to his own: and who can<br>  tell why the experience of nations should in this case by different from that<br>  of private men? In a rectified state of international affairs, half a dozen<br>  princes on a continent would have little more occasion to meddle with one<br>  another than half a dozen neighbors in a street.<br></p><p>  But indeed,<br>  <em>Communities</em>  frequently contribute to their own injury. If governors are ambitious, or<br>  resentful, or proud, so, often, are the people;—and the public good has often<br>  been sacrificed by the public, with astonishing preposterousness, to jealousy<br>  or vexation. Some merchants are angry at the loss of a branch of trade; they<br>  urge the government to interfere; memorials and remonstrances follow to the<br>  state of whom they complain;—and so, by that process of exasperation which is<br>  quite natural when people think that high language and a high attitude is<br>  politic, the nations soon begin to fight. The merchants applaud the spirit of<br>  their rulers,—while in one year they lose more by war than they would have<br>  lost by the want of the trade for twenty; and before peace returns, the nation<br>  has lost more than it would have lost by the continuance of the evil for<br>  twenty centuries. Peace at length arrives, and the government begins to devise<br>  means of repairing the mischiefs of the war. Both government and people<br>  reflect very complacently on the wisdom of their measures,—forgetting that<br>  their conduct is only that of a man who wantonly fractures his own leg with a<br>  club, and then boasts to his neighbors how dexterously he limps to a surgeon.<br></p><p>  Present expedients for present occasions, rather than a wide embracing and<br>  far-seeing policy, is the great characteristic of European politics. We are<br>  hucksters who cannot resist the temptation of a present sixpence, rather than<br>  merchants who wait for their profits for the return of a fleet. Si quaeris<br>  monumentum, circumspice. [If you are looking for a monument, look around.]<br>  Look at the condition of either of the continental nations, and consider what<br>  it might have been if even a short line of princes had attended to their<br>  proper business,—had directed their solicitude to the improvement of the moral<br>  and social and political condition of the people. Who has been more successful<br>  in this huckster policy than France? And what is France, and what are the<br>  French people at the present hour?—Why, as it respects real welfare they are<br>  not merely surpassed, they are left at an immeasurable distance, by a people<br>  who sprung up but as yesterday,—by a people whose land, within the memory of<br>  our grand-fathers, was almost a wilderness, long since France boasted of her<br>  greatness. Such results have a cause. It is not possible that systems of<br>  policy can be good, of which the effects are so bad. I speak not of particular<br>  measures or of individual acts of ill policy,—these are not likely to be the<br>  result of the condition of man,—but of the whole international system,—a<br>  system of irritability, and haughtiness, and temporary expedients; a system of<br>  most unphilosophical principles, and from which christianity is practically<br>  almost excluded. Here is the evidence of fact before us. We know what a<br>  sickening detail the history of Europe is. And it is obvious to remark, that<br>  the system which has given rise to such a history must be vicious and mistaken<br>  in its fundamental principles. The same class of history will continue to<br>  after generations unless these principles are changed,—unless philosophy and<br>  christianity obtain a greater influence in the practice of government; unless,<br>  in a word, governments are content to do their proper business, and to leave<br>  that which is not their business, undone.<br></p><p>  When such principles are acted upon we may reasonably expect a rapid<br>  advancement in the whole condition of the world. Domestic measures which are<br>  now postponed to the more stirring occupations of legislators, will be found<br>  to be of incomparably greater importance than they. A wise code of criminal<br>  law will be found to be of more consequence and interest than the acquisition<br>  of a million square miles of territory;—A judicious encouragement of general<br>  education will be of more value than all the “glory” that has been acquired<br>  from the days of Alfred till now. Of moral legislation, however it will be our<br>  after business to speak; Meanwhile the lover of mankind has some reason for<br>  gratulation in perceiving indications that governments will hereafter direct<br>  their attention more to the objects for which they are invested with power.<br>  The statesmen who promotes this improvement will be what many statesmen have<br>  been<br>  <em>called</em>  —a great man. That government only is great which promotes the prosperity of<br>  its own people; and that people only are prosperous, who are wise and happy.<br></p>",

    "transcription": "<p>  “We are in the midst of a revolution,” was the startling, and true as<br>  startling, declaration, with which Mr. Clay commenced his speech in the Senate<br>  some weeks ago. We are in the midst of a political revolution, which is<br>  silently but fatally sapping the principles of our free institutions, and<br>  consolidating the whole action of the Government, into the will of the<br>  executive. “The President is far above the reach of anything said in this<br>  House,” said Mr Polk; and a passive House of Representatives—the people’s own<br>  House—hear without resenting the insolent assertion, and by their silence<br>  admit its truth. Yet the minister or favorite, who, on the floor of the<br>  English House of Commons, or of the French Chamber of Deputies, should hazard<br>  such a vaunt of the crowned monarchs of either of those realms, would be put<br>  to silence and to shame, by the indignant voices of men of<br>  <em>all</em>  parties. He would, in those<br>  <em>limited monarchies</em>  be told that the king, like the humblest man in the kingdom, was the subject<br>  of the laws and the creature of opinion; and that it belonged not to him, or<br>  to any one for him, to claim exemption from that dependence upon the people’s<br>  representatives, ordained for the common good o all. In this<br>  <em>freest of republics,</em>  infallibility in judgement and in action; the right of constructing according<br>  to his own will all laws, and of dismissing at his own will all functionaries<br>  who see not with his eyes; and finally entire independence of the opinion of<br>  the Legislatures; are openly claimed for the Executive; and all who demur in<br>  the least to this sweeping claim, or who suggest that, even with the best<br>  motives, and the greatest caution, there may be error or mistake in some given<br>  act, are denounced as enemies to the “venerable President,” and forthwith<br>  trampled under foot as rebels and traitors—not to the country, or to<br>  freedom—but to<br>  <em>the</em>  party. We are then in the midst of a revolution, which is habituating us fast<br>  and fatally to disregard all those checks and balances which the wise<br>  contrivers of the Constitution, thought sufficient and availing, to secure the<br>  independence of each department in its proper sphere; and to look to the<br>  Executive head alone, as the fountain of all honor, profit and power. Nor is<br>  it to politics alone that the revolution is confined. In a country like this,<br>  where every citizen does, or may if he pleases, take a part in its public<br>  affairs, no great revolution in politics can be effected without a<br>  corresponding revolution in morals. Accordingly we find that the spirit of<br>  party, which now directs all its discipline and energy to sustain allegiance<br>  and devotion to the person of the President—be his measures what they<br>  may—infects the judgement or corrupts the principles of men on other subjects,<br>  and the recklessness with which conscience is outraged, in approving political<br>  measures, which in fact it disapproved—may come at last to pervert entirely<br>  the warning voice of that secret monitor.<br></p><p>  It would seem the very “error of the moon” that men and doctrines such as<br>  these we have this alluded to, should find a place and a bearing in the<br>  Legislative halls of a people so practical, and which flatters itself with<br>  being so enlightened, as ours—were it not that a sufficient earthly<br>  explanation is at hand in the cause we referred to in the outset of these<br>  remarks—the spirit of party—which, so that implicit and uncompromising<br>  obedience be rendered to its mandates, is little solicitous about any other<br>  qualifications, in the instruments it puts forth. Truly indeed did Mr Binney<br>  conclude, that the question now in issue in this country is, whether this<br>  “spirit of party” be not more fatal to free institutions here, than the spirit<br>  of despotism has proved elsewhere. Its inevitable tendency, at any rate, is to<br>  degrade, even though it may not wholly destroy;—and in that stage of the<br>  question, most certainly, this State now is.—<br>  <em>N.Y.

On the evening<br>  of Sunday the 23d ult. being at the Tavern in company with one of his comrades<br>  the latter purchased a quart of<br>  <em>Cider Brandy</em>  and they proceeded homeward together, occasionally sipping a little of the<br>  <em>“good creatures”</em>  to drown their cares and exhilarate their drooping spirits.

They accompanied this movement by an explanation<br>  that their Bank had resolved to touch no more the Treasury Funds—that the sum<br>  brought was all they then held—and from that time their connection with the<br>  Government must cease.<br></p><p>  They remarked also, that they should leave the money in the branch, hoping<br>  they would consent to take care of it, for that upon no consideration would<br>  they permit it to return to their vaults. So much for the glorious experiment.<br>  “By St Paul, the work goes bravely on,” The people have said no to the<br>  experiment, and now even the pet banks begin to denounce the folly and<br>  impotence of the greatest and best.—<br>  <em>Star-spangled-Banner.</em></p>",

JUDGES EATON, GRIFFIN and CHASE.</p><p align=\"center\">State vs. Frederic Olney</p><p>  The information charged the defendant with having on the 28<sup>th</sup>  of January last, feloniously, voluntarily, maliciously, and wilfully, set fire<br>  to the dwelling-house of Miss Prudence Crandall, in Canterbury, in the County<br>  of Windham, and then and there, with force and arms, burning the same. The<br>  information having been read, the defendant for plea, said that he was NOT<br>  GUILTY.<br></p><p>  <em>Ebenezer Sangar</em>  was at the house of Miss Crandall the day of the fire—did not get there till<br>  it was pretty much over. The house was wet, and people were at work about it,<br>  cutting up the floors, &amp;c. While witness was in the house, Mr. Olney (the<br>  defendant) came in and told Capt. Bacon, who was cutting up the mop-board,<br>  that it was useless to cut longer for there was no fire. People soon began to<br>  go away. Mr. Olney showed where he said the fire commenced—placed his hand on<br>  a particular place and the expressed he used was “<br>  <em>Gentlemen of the jury, here the fire commenced.”</em>  He had an iron-bar in his hand, with which he took off the moulding &amp;c.,<br>  to show what the fire had done. It seemed that the fire had worked from the<br>  inside of the house to the outside—this appeared by the boards and timbers—the<br>  top of the soil was burnt off, as was also the outside—it was rotten so that<br>  it might be picked to pieces—the bottom of the sill was not burnt. In the<br>  north-east room, below, there was in the inside under the mop-board a crack<br>  which was perhaps three-eights [sic] of an inch in width—the fire-place is on<br>  the west side of the room—the house fronts the east—the fire was in the<br>  north-east corner of the room. There was no difficulty, in the opinion of the<br>  witness, in setting the house on fire in the way it was from the inside—it<br>  might have been done by thrusting under-lighted paper, &amp;c. If fired in<br>  this way the outer edge of the sill would be likely to catch first. Should not<br>  think that fire could have been put on the outside so as to cause the<br>  fire—does not think it possible that the top of the sill could have been set<br>  fire to from the outside, as this sill was. The principal part of the burning<br>  was high up near the chamber floor.<br></p><p>  <em>Cross-examined.</em>  Saw no fire after he got there. Most of the cutting was done before he got<br>  there—the weather-board was taken up and the mouldings—some clap-boards had<br>  been taken off before—it was from 12 to 15 inches from the upright post, and<br>  south of it, in the corner of the room where the fire did most damage. No hole<br>  was burned, but the wood was blacked—should think the fire originally<br>  commenced at the place mentioned near the post. The board next the sill, and<br>  the side of it next the sill, was burned most—this board had a crack in it,<br>  and the wood near the crack was charred, mostly on the inside. The lathing was<br>  burned some, enough so as to black one’s fingers—witness did not make his<br>  examinations all at one time, but at several—once with Dr. Harris.<br></p><p>  <em>Vine Robinson.</em>  On Saturday of the week that the fire happened he went, as one of the<br>  committee from the Insurance Company, to make some agreement, if possible,<br>  with Miss Crandall as to the amount of loss which she had sustained. The house<br>  seemed to be in the same situation as it was left immediately after the<br>  fire—the clap-boards were torn off, &amp;c. Examined, to satisfy his mind, how<br>  the fire originated—became convinced that it took first on the sill, between<br>  the first stud and the post—burned apparently up to the chamber-floor, and<br>  meeting with some instruction there, seemed to branch off—burned the boards<br>  and joist, should think there was more burning in the chamber-floor than<br>  elsewhere—proceeded to place the boards, &amp;c. round the pilaster as they<br>  originally were, in order to ascertain if there was any place where the fire<br>  could have been introduced from without—the board at the bottom of the sill<br>  was burnet off—the clap-boards were not burnt—found no place on examination<br>  where the fire could have been introduced—thinks it impossible to have<br>  communicated the fire from the outside so as to produce the effect visible—the<br>  crack between the mop-board and the floor on the inside of the room was<br>  perhaps one third of an inch wide—no difficulty in putting fire under it—if a<br>  match were placed under the mop-board and pushed along it would fall about two<br>  inches on to the sill—witness became satisfied that the Company would be<br>  responsible for the loss, and tried to settle the amount but could not. It was<br>  left to Col. Eaton to procure a carpenter and finish the business—the sill was<br>  considerably decayed—the fire was confined between the first stud and the<br>  post.<br></p><p>  <em>Cross examined.</em>  There was a hole burnt in the boards a considerable height from the ground,<br>  higher than he could reach—this could be seen from the outside—the board at<br>  the bottom was perhaps 8 inches wide—three or four inches of it were burnt<br>  off—this board was near the post—about the space of a foot along the sill it<br>  was charred—the sill at the bottom was whole.<br></p><p>  <em>Ebenezer Sangar,</em>  again called, testified as to one of the boards that was burnt near the<br>  post—the board went to the bottom of the sill.<br></p><p>  <em>Elkanah C. Eaton</em>  was also one of the Committee with Judge Robinson to settle damages, and with<br>  him examined to find out the origin of the fire. (Col. Eaton said he concurred<br>  in the statement given by Judge Robinson, and recapitulated, with little<br>  variation, the same general facts.)<br></p><p>  <em>Richard Fenner</em>  got to the fire nearly as soon as any one—saw the smoke from the outside, and<br>  went directly into the house. Saw Miss Crandall and asked her if the fire came<br>  from the cellar; she said, no, her house had been set on fire. Witness<br>  assisted to pry up the hearth to find the fire, but found but little—the smoke<br>  continued to increase—water was thrown on. After the fire was got under, Olney<br>  shoed the witness and others a spot on the outside of the house, where he said<br>  the fire began—witness examined it more critically, because he did not notice<br>  it when he first came to the fire; Witness came out of his store immediately<br>  after he heard the bell ring, and a cry of fire—Saw smoke come from the corner<br>  of the house, up some height from the ground.—Olney said that when he first<br>  came out of the house, he saw fire blazing out of a crack, and pointed it out<br>  to witness—the paint around it was scorched.<br></p><p>  <em>Cross Examined.</em>  The crack with Olney showed witness was perhaps an eighth of an inch in width,<br>  just by the bottom of the sill, between the bottom board and the moulding—saw<br>  no appearance of fire when the place was pointed out—witness at first saw no<br>  fire, nothing but smoke which came from about the window casings—Olney was at<br>  the corner of the house when he got there and had an axe in his hand—it was<br>  after the fire was over that Olney pointed out this place—perhaps<br>  three-fourths of an hour after the alarm.<br></p><p>  <em>Daniel Morgan</em>  was at the house of Dr. Harris at the time of the fire, and noticed a tub of<br>  water brought out from Miss Crandall’s and thrown on to the side of the<br>  house—a little steam arose which led him to suppose the water was hot—Charles<br>  Harris soon brought an axe—Olney took it and struck a blow or two on the house<br>  near the corner with it. Witness then went over to Miss C’s house, but saw no<br>  fire—looked into the house and saw smoke in the room—told Miss C. that it must<br>  come from the cellar—examined, but found none—a little smoke could not be seen<br>  coming out from the house, seven or eight feet from the ground, near the<br>  floor—they had axes and struck in to take off the clapboards—took off some but<br>  saw no fire till the floor was torn up in the chamber—then saw a little and a<br>  great deal of smoke, so much that it was impossible to stay in the room. The<br>  sill appeared natural, but some rotten—took out some shavings which were black<br>  but not burnt—witness got to the house before any one, unless it was Mr.<br>  Robinson—as he could see no fire he was surprised that they had raised an<br>  alarm—did not see Olney when he first got over to the house—when he first saw<br>  him he was near the corner of the house—the clapboards which&nbsp; he and Mr<br>  Robinson cut were as high as they could reach.<br></p><p>  <em>Cross Examined.</em>  Witness saw Olney and Harris at the corner of Miss Crandall’s house, before he<br>  came over from Dr Harris’—Harris soon started to ring the bell and Olney<br>  dashed on a tub of water—this was before the blows with an axe—the water was<br>  thrown on the side of the house, between the window and the post—cannot say<br>  whether Olney cut off any portion of the house—thought that a small piece was<br>  cut off at first—continued to think so till the former trial, when a piece was<br>  shown, said to be cut off—he then and now doubts whether any was cut off—Dr.<br>  Harris’ house is six or seven rods from Miss Crandall’s.<br></p><p>  <em>Ralph Robinson</em>  got to the fire, when some of the neighbors were standing at the corner—could<br>  see smoke coming out—witness tried to cut off some of the clapboards, but<br>  could not reach them—pried them off with an iron bar—they could then see a<br>  little fire—no clapboards had been cut when witness got there—did not leave<br>  his school house till after the bell rung—saw no fire at the bottom of the<br>  pilaster—the clap-boards were got off in a very few minutes, perhaps three—saw<br>  water thrown on after the clap-boards were taken off, not before.<br></p><p>  <em>Peter Spicer,</em>  (a carpenter,) examined the house day of the the first court (sic). [Mr.<br>  Spicer showed the manner in which the boards &amp;c. were burned, and gave it<br>  as his opinion that the fire communicated from within.]<br></p><p>  <em>Horace Bacon,</em>  assisted to arrest Frederick Olney, it was in a barber’s shop at Norwich—a<br>  number of persons were present—some one asked witness his opinion as to the<br>  origin of the fire—said that he believed it caught from the inside. Olney said<br>  he knew as much about the fire as any one. Witness replied, I suppose you do.<br>  Olney then said that Miss Crandall wished him to fix her clock—that he<br>  commenced fixing it and soon found smoke in the room—at first thought the<br>  evergreens in the room were on fire, examined them and found they were<br>  not—then thought the carpet was—found that it was not. Soon heard the fire<br>  roar in the walls of the house ran out and saw it burst out from a crack near<br>  the corner of the house.<br></p><p>  <em>James Cary</em>  read the warrant to Olney in Norwich. Mr Bacon said that he thought the fire<br>  caught on the inside—Olney said that there was a knot-hole outside about the<br>  bigness of a dollar where the fire might have been placed. (Witness then went<br>  out).<br></p><p>  <em>Maria Robinson</em>  was at Miss Crandall’s house at work on the 28<sup>th</sup>  day of January, the day of the fire—the stage stopped, and the first she saw<br>  Olney he was standing by the side of the stage—some bundles &amp;c. were<br>  brought into the house and Olney came in and sat down in the keeping-room by<br>  the fire, remarked that it was cold, looking at the clock on the mantel-piece,<br>  after he had sat a few moments, said to Miss Crandall, “your clock does not<br>  beat right.” Miss Crandall replied, that she had not noticed it, or did not<br>  know it. Miss Crandall soon asked him to take off his surtout, and said that<br>  she had not asked him before because she supposed he was cold—Mr Olney asked<br>  if Mr. and Mrs Harris were in the house, and was told they were in the<br>  kitchen, said to Miss Crandall, “with your permission I will go and see them,”<br>  she said, yes—he came back in a little while, and that he had promised to<br>  write to a lady in New-York as soon as he got there and had seen her little<br>  daughter, the paper was brought, and Olney wrote and sealed a letter, he then<br>  went out and witness saw him no more till dinner, when she saw him in the<br>  upper kitchen, talking with Mr. and Mrs. Harris. After dinner she came back to<br>  the keeping-room, and a number of the girls were in and out. They all went out<br>  but witness, as she thinks, (she remarked that Miss Almira Crandall thought<br>  she remained after her) and witness, who was sewing, laid down her work, and<br>  went to the kitchen. Had heard Olney talking in the kitchen before this, and<br>  had seen him there. Very soon there was a disturbance, and some one cried that<br>  the house was on fire. Witness said it could not be, but ran up stairs, for<br>  she remembered that she had left her work on the hearth and she was afraid<br>  that it had caught fire. Found the room so full of smoke, when she got to it,<br>  that she could not see the figure on the paper. Ran out of doors, and saw<br>  Olney standing near the corner of the house, looking for the fire. Witness<br>  told him that the chimney or roof was on fire, he said no, and soon said he<br>  had found it. Olney then struck on the corner of the house, with an axe, and<br>  told her to cry fire. It was about half-past ten or eleven when Olney came in<br>  the stage, witness noticed no smoke nor perceived any unpleasant smell in the<br>  keeping-room before fire was cried, don’t know where Olney went when he went<br>  from the keeping-room, but supposed he went to the kitchen.<br></p><p>  <em>Cross examined.</em>  Was in the keeping-room when the stage came up—soon after Olney came in the<br>  clock struck eleven—thinks it was an hour after dinner when she was employed<br>  sewing—Olney had not been alone in the keeping-room&nbsp; more than a minute,<br>  when the fire was cried—after Olney had struck on the corner of the house with<br>  the axe, he called for water—he had asked for an axe before—he cut off a small<br>  piece of the house, and some one bro’t water—told Harris to get the bell<br>  rung—heard nothing said about fixing the clock—there were festoons of<br>  evergreen hung around the room.<br></p><p>  <em>Amy Fenner</em>  was in the school room at the time of the fire—saw Mr. Olney as he came in the<br>  stage, at about half past ten—saw him no more till dinner. Witness went<br>  upstairs to the school room, and Miss Crandall sent the class down to<br>  read—they came down to the keeping-room, and witness saw Mr. Olney fixing the<br>  clock—she saw smoke, and said to Mr. Olney, What is the matter? What does this<br>  mean? She pointed Olney to the corner of the room—he put down his ear, and<br>  said he heard it roar—then immediately called for an axe—witness was very much<br>  scared.<br>  <strong>This is the key testimony, from a student</strong></p><p>  <em>Cross examined.</em>  Knows nothing of the letter—Olney was talking with Mrs. Harris when witness<br>  saw him at dinner—‘twas not more than three minutes after she was told to go<br>  down with the class to read before she was in the room with Olney—he was<br>  alone—the door was wide open—cannot tell what Olney was doing to the clock,<br>  she was so frightened—smelled nothing in the room before—Olney’s back was<br>  towards the smoke, he could not see it without turning round—witness could see<br>  it immediately on entering—heard no walking in the room before she came in,<br>  was out of doors when the tub of water was thrown on the house—Olney took the<br>  tub from the hands of Miss Crandall—cannot tell whether the door of the clock<br>  was open or not she was so frightened—the smoke had just began to come out of<br>  the corner.<br></p><p>  <em>Henrietta Bolt</em>  was a member of the same class, and made a statement similar to the last<br>  witness.<br></p><p>  <em>Delano Baker</em>  was at the fire not long after it was cried—went from Dr. Harris’ wood-pile,<br>  saw smoke, but no fire was visible—Olney was standing by the corner of the<br>  house, axes were called for, witness said he could get one. After the fire was<br>  over Olney showed where he said the fire began—said, “here, gentlemen of the<br>  jury, here is the place where the fire began.” Witness went away soon, and did<br>  not notice where Olney directed their attention—saw no fire at the former,<br>  when he got to the house first; thinks he should have seen it if there had<br>  been any; a spot was burned up some distance from the ground. What is implied<br>  by Olney using legalistic language here? Prescience?<br></p><p>  <em>Cross examined.</em>  Was a stranger in the place, and does not know the people who were at the<br>  house; should not know the girls of the house again if he saw them.<br></p><p>  <em>Augustus Prior</em>  went with Col. Eaton to examine the house in order to ascertain the damages;<br>  it was on Monday. (second examination.) [Mr. Prior agreed generally in his<br>  statement with Col. Eaton, and was of opinion that the fire was communicated<br>  from within.]<br></p><p>  <em>Ralph Hutchinson</em>  examined the house of Miss Crandall on the day of the court of inquiry before<br>  the Justice; the board on the outside, near the crack, was burnt to a coal; a<br>  part of the burning could be seen from the outside; did not notice whether the<br>  lath was burnt or not; the pedestal is 16 3-4 inches; the base of the pilaster<br>  1 1-4 feet; the mop-board was up from the floor a full half inch, a foot from<br>  the corner; the first stud was perhaps 13 inches from the post; thinks the<br>  fire could easily have been introduced from the inside; the mortar was gone at<br>  the time of the examination made b witness, and that being gone, the fire<br>  could also have been introduced from the outside; if the mortar had not been<br>  taken out, he should think it could not have been introduced from the outside;<br>  witness saw mortar lying on the ground.<br></p><p>  <em>Cross examined.</em>  The place where the burnt part could be seen from without, was by the<br>  water-stable; it was just perceivable; should think the fire might have been<br>  seen at this place from without; the bottom board sets on the water-table; the<br>  inside of the oak board was burnt very much; the outside not much; the fire<br>  could not have been put on the top of the sill from the outside.<br></p><p>  <em>Chauncey Bacon,</em>  at the time that Miss Crandall’s house was discovered to be on fire, was in<br>  Mr. Jenk’s store. At first, he heard the bell ring, and saw people running,<br>  apparently towards Miss C.’s house. When he got to her front gate, he asked<br>  what was the matter? Was told, by a boy, that the house was on fire, and was<br>  pointed towards the northeast corner of the house; went directly into the<br>  house and found considerable smoke; some one took an axe, and beat a hole from<br>  the inside, through the plaster, in the east wall of the room; being told, on<br>  enquiry, that there was no other axe, witness got one from home and beat a<br>  number of holes in the north wall of the room; found no fire, and but little<br>  or no smoke; others were turning in water; witness then went into the cellar<br>  to look for the fire, but found none; then to the garret, and found none; soon<br>  after, witness went out of doors and found the people tearing off boards,<br>  &amp;c.; some were cutting up the boards in the floor up stairs, and he<br>  assisted; smoke came out and they threw in water; came down stairs, and saw<br>  fire first near the cornice, in the room below; could see but a small blaze;<br>  ran up stairs and told the people that the floor must come up; they took it<br>  up, together with the mop-board and very soon came to the fire; six or eight<br>  feet of the mop-board was cut off; the fire was soon got under; witness then<br>  examined the timbers, &amp;c. more particularly, though he could not do so as<br>  he wished, there was such a crowd; the lining boards were oak, put on the<br>  studs, and ran clear by, to the cut-edge of the post; the bottom board, south<br>  of where it was burnt off, was very snug, so that he could not pass a penknife<br>  in the crack; the crack between the mop-board and the floor, in the lower<br>  room, was large enough to take in his little finger, in some places; the under<br>  floor boards set on the sill about four inches; the upper ones an inch less;<br>  should not think it possible to get fire on the sill from the outside.<br></p><p>  <em>Cross examined.</em>  He put his finger in the crack, between the floor and the mop-board; the<br>  widest part of it was towards the south, at some distance from the corner,<br>  perhaps six feet; the floor boards run north and south; put his finger in the<br>  crack the day after the fire, and has since examined it; should think that the<br>  crack was 1-4 on an inch, near the corner; perceived no difference in its<br>  width at the different times he examined it; don’t know whether the sill was<br>  burnt at the bottom or on the sides; should think the under lining board was<br>  wider than the sill; the end of the bottom board was nurnt off; the board<br>  above it extends along to the end, so he presumes this one did; cannot say<br>  whether the board burnt off was fastened to the sill or not; has not examined<br>  the sill south of the stud where te fire was; found shavings between the studs<br>  after taking off the plastering; but few, perhaps three, four, or half a<br>  dozen. They were further south than where the fire was, between the first stud<br>  and post; don't recollect whether burnt or not; they were small pieces, not<br>  bigger than ninepenny pieces or cents; were old, and had probably been there<br>  from the building of the house.<br></p><p>  <em>John Bard.</em>  (This witness was present during the fire, and assisted to extinguish it; he<br>  gave particulars of the transaction, but stated to new facts that seemed<br>  material.)<br></p><p>  <em>Solomon Paine,</em>  with the committee from the Insurance Company, examined the premises after the<br>  fire. (Mr. Paine said he coincided in the statement made by Col. Eaton as to<br>  what they saw.) His opinion was, that if the lining board was as wide at the<br>  place where the fire was, as it was farther back, it would be impossible to<br>  set the fire from the outside; the board was some inches higher than the sill,<br>  a little back from the fire, where it was not burnt.<br></p><p>  <em>Nehemiah Ensworth.</em>  After he got to the fire, to which he was called by the ringing of the bell,<br>  he first went to the corner of the house and soon went into the house, met<br>  Olney and asked how the fire caught. Olney replied that he did not know, said<br>  he saw it about as soon as any one, that he was fixing the clock, saw a smoke,<br>  examined, and soon heard the fire roar, witness at this time did not know<br>  Olney.<br></p><p>  <em>Daniel Morgan</em>  again called.

Fenner, several persons took out some of the mortar,<br>  witness took out some, an inch and a half long, took it out to examine the<br>  sill, has not examined else-where, what he took out was moist, took it out<br>  with his fingers, some had been taken out before, cannot be positive who took<br>  it out; it was after the fire had been extinguished; Mr. Flint was present;<br>  thinks he took out some; it was under the sill and ran perpendicular; the<br>  mortar which he (the witness) took out was between the stones, immediately<br>  below the sill, not more than two or three inches below.<br></p><p>  <em>William Worthington.</em>  After the fire was pretty much out, Olney went up stairs and put his arm round<br>  one of the girl’s neck, and asked how many of them cried? They said, such a<br>  one. Olney then said they had no need to be scared before they were hurt; that<br>  he did not think the house would burn down, if it had, Miss Crandall would<br>  lose nothing for the house was insured; witness got to the house before the<br>  fire broke out; could then see no fire; went close to the corner; saw smoke;<br>  did not see Olney for a few minutes; no clapboards were cut when he (the<br>  witness) first got there. Mr. Robinson cut the first as high as he could<br>  reach.<br></p><p>  <em>Cross examined.</em>  Don’t know how many girls were present at the time of conversation he speaks<br>  of, shouldn’t know them now; witness was a pupil in Mr. Robinson’s school; he<br>  was in school, and it was said that Miss Crandall’s house was on fire; Mr. R.<br>  got there about as soon as they did; don’t know whether Mr Morgan was then<br>  there or not; saw him soon; did not see Miss Crandall; saw no water when he<br>  first got there; looked round to find the fire, and then went into the house;<br>  they had cut a few holes in the plastering; saw Olney near the corner of the<br>  house first.<br></p><p>  <em>Luther Sangar.</em>  (This was also a pupil of Mr. Robinson, was with the last witness and made a<br>  similar statement.)<br></p><p>[The prosecution here rested for the present.]</p><p align=\"center\">[To be concluded in our next.]</p><p></p>",

We trust, not the slightest<br>  suspicion of his guilt remains on the mind of any disinterested persons, who<br>  heard the trial. The jury would probably have given their verdict without<br>  leaving their seats, if they had previously chosen a foreman. But so soon as<br>  they had retired to their room and organized, they gave a unanimous vote in<br>  his favor. And this they might have done if they had heard only the evidence<br>  on the part of the State—for the testimony of some of the witnesses brought<br>  forward by the public prosecutor, went to show clearly that even if the fire<br>  were communicated on the inside, Mr. Olney could not have done it.<br></p><p>  Now, therefore, that Col. Judson and his coadjutors have been permitted to<br>  indulge their suspicions to the utmost, and to subject a perfectly innocent<br>  man to the mortification and expense of a criminal prosecution, because he<br>  happened to be on the<br>  <em>inside</em>  of Miss Crandall’s house on the day of the fire, now, we seriously hope the he<br>  and they will look diligently among those on the<br>  <em>outside</em>  of the house for the real incendiary. No one, we trust, is willing to suspect<br>  that the Col. or any of the respectable people in Canterbury, did the deed;<br>  but there probably are persons in the town capable of such a crime—or some who<br>  might do it without considering it would be a<br>  <em>crime</em>  thus, or in any other way, to “break up” the “nigger school.” Col. Judson and<br>  his fellow laborers against that school have done all in their power to excite<br>  the most virulent and reckless hostility to it. We were ourselves present in<br>  the famous town meeting on the 9<sup>th</sup>  of March, 1833, and there we heard enough said by the Col. and his colleagues<br>  to instigate persons of a certain character to violence against the school. It<br>  is notorious that minor acts of violence have repeatedly been committed<br>  against her house—and they must not wonder if those who have thrown stones and<br>  rotten eggs and filth, with impunity if not with applause, should be<br>  emboldened to apply even the slow match. That this or something like this was<br>  meditated the public are compelled to believe by the article in the Advertiser<br>  of Dec. 19<sup>th*</sup>  —and will not all have reason to suspect that the Col. and his coadjutors and<br>  the public prosecutor are leagued to protect the real culprit, unless they now<br>  set about in earnest to find him, in the direction pointed out by Mr.<br>  Holbrook? This mysterious affair ought to be cleared up. No one could rejoice<br>  more than we should do to have it satisfactory proved, that the fire was<br>  accidental. But there appears to be scarcely any doubt that it was the work of<br>  an incendiary. Therefore let the felon be hunted for without further delay.<br>  Mr. Holbrook has refused to give to the public at our request, and has even<br>  refused to give to Miss Crandall, an explanation of his meaning in the article<br>  to which we have so often alluded. But Col. Judson and the State’s Attorney<br>  can doubtless elicit from him the information which has so long been called<br>  for in vain.<br></p>",

The last orders were dated<br>  at Canterbury a few rods North of Miss Crandall’s school.

That the misunderstanding nad difficulty among the officers<br>  had blown over and all were as good friends as ever. Col. A.T. the commanding<br>  officer, is looking out for promotion. Uncle Davy says when all the officers<br>  of his division get together this Spring at New-Haven, he will have the Col.<br>  appointed Commissary, Judge, or something which he will like much better than<br>  actual service in the field, and thus give a better chance for the under<br>  officers. But the Col. would be altogether out of his place, on the bench. He<br>  would appear, and no doubt feel, much like Jack Downing’s mouse, treed in an<br>  empty flour barrel.—The old gentleman has not concluded yet whether to issue<br>  another Proclamation or not—but he says something must be done to procure more<br>  soldiers. He don’t seem to like the appearance of the old Republican army, and<br>  what looks more cloudy than any thing else, he don’t think it will do to come<br>  into action till he gets a new recruit from Windham. But every good soldier<br>  listed in the Republican army just as soon as&nbsp; they found out what Uncle<br>  Davy and the ‘Arch Bishop’ were up to.

Spafford is<br>  one of the genuine old fashioned republicans, a straight forward, common sense<br>  man, who, if he should be elected, will do the thing that is right. He is not<br>  for abolishing Sabbath laws, or Thanksgiving laws. He believes in none of the<br>  new-fangled black laws, or New-Haven memorials, but will go straight a-head as<br>  every independent republican should do, supporting such measures only as will<br>  operate equally upon all our citizens.

His pamphlet being locally available suggests, once again, that the students at the Canterbury Female Academy were reading about their own struggle!</p><p> <p></p><p>The pamphlet in question, for instance, compared the Canterbury Female Academy students to impressed sailors (one of the alleged causes of the War of 1812):<br>  “The war of the revolution was a contest for principle. Had the principle in<br>  question been yielded, who could have set limits to the acts of oppression<br>  growing out it ? So also in our war for sailors’ rights, the bone of<br>  contention was, the right of search and impressment. The mere fact that a few<br>  seamen had been injured and abused, was as nothing, aside from the principle<br>  involved. This, in common with that of the revolution, was a contest for<br>  principle, and the oppression resisted was the oppression of principle. And<br>  further, whence the utter odiousness and the cruel oppression of the far-famed<br>  ‘black law’ of Connecticut? Not that Miss Crandall and a few colored Misses<br>  are subjected by it to certain shameful acts of cruelty and oppression. These<br>  are as nothing, comparatively, except as they involve principle; and the law,<br>  which allows and sanctions them, is itself comparatively harmless and<br>  innocent, except as it involves principle—principle which puts in jeopardy the<br>  rights of thousands.</p>  <p>Amos A.

The literary department of<br>  the Lady’s Book is of admitted superiority; for in conjunction with the great<br>  but boasted liberality with which they encourage the development of<br>  <em>Native Authors,</em>  they possess facilities of selection, through their foreign agents and<br>  correspondents from works of which<br>  <em>no other copies</em>  are sent to this country.<br></p><p>  Among the many claims which the Lady’s Book has on the patronage of Americans,<br>  the least is not, that it was the first publication to present correct<br>  representations of the newest fashions of female costume, and in that respect<br>  it may fairly claim a superiority over all other contemporaries: for we<br>  proprietors seldom calculate the expense of rendering it altogether deserving<br>  of its increased and increasing patrons.<br></p><p>  Never was the title of a book more justified by its contents than that of the<br>  Lady’s Book—Literature, foreign and domestic—selected and original—Engravings<br>  on steel and wood, of scenery, distinguished persons, fashions and embroidery,<br>  all rich and beautiful, and from the hands of the most eminent artists. Its<br>  literature select, free from dullness, though teeming with usefulness, and<br>  conveying pleasure and amusement through the extensive medium of delicate<br>  discrimination. To musical amateurs of both sexes, the Lady’s Book offers many<br>  advantages, each number being accompanied by a popular piece, arranged with<br>  accompaniments for the piano forte, &amp;c &amp;c. under the<br>  <em>surveillance</em>  of competent persons, and to its pages the general reader can always turn and<br>  find amusement, novelty, and instruction.<br></p><p>  Each number shall, as hitherto, average 60 pages of extra royal octavo letter<br>  press, printed with clear, new and beautiful type, on paper of the finest<br>  texture and whitest colour. It will continue to be embellished with the most<br>  splendid engravings on copper and steel, embracing every variety of subject,<br>  and the quarterly numbers will as heretofore contain figures of Philadelphia<br>  Fashions, two and occasionally three, beautifully and faithfully colored, to<br>  commence with the January number, being No. 1 of the eighth volume.

During that<br>  short period the number of subscribers has increased to 20,000, and the work<br>  has received, every where, the most unqualified approbation. It has found its<br>  way to thousands of families, and while it has entertained the social circle,<br>  its unobtrusive lessons have, we trust, often had a<br>  <em>salutary influence</em>  on the<br>  <em>juvenile mind</em>  and<br>  <em>heart.</em>  It has also found its way to the school room; and many classes of young pupils<br>  have been cheered twice a month&nbsp; y the welcome voice of their teacher<br>  bidding them to lay aside for a few days, the class book which they have read<br>  over and over, perhaps twenty times, and read the pages of Parley’s Magazine.<br>  The demand for the work, to be used in schools, is rapidly increasing.<br></p><p>  Encouraged by such unexampled success, the Publishers have resolved to render<br>  it still more worthy so liberal a patronage; and not to remit their exertions<br>  till they see it introduced into families and schools, throughout the whole<br>  length and breadth of the United States.<br></p><p>  In this view they have secured new aid in the Editorial department. The late<br>  Editor of the Juvenile Rambler, who, in addition to his qualifications as a<br>  writer for the young, has the advantage of many years experience as a teacher,<br>  will henceforth assist in conducting it.<br></p><p>  We propose to present, in the progress of each volume, a great variety of<br>  interesting and important topics, among which are the following.<br></p><p>  I.Natural History—Of beasts, birds, fishes, reptiles, insects; plants,<br>  flowers, trees; the human frame, &amp;c.<br></p><p>II.Biography—Especially of the young.</p><p>III.Geography—Accounts of places, manners, customs, etc.</p><p>IV.Travels and Voyages, in various parts of the world.</p><p>  V.Lively Descriptions of the Curiosities of<br>  <em>Nature</em>  and<br>  <em>Art—</em>  in each of the United States, and in other countries.<br></p><p>  VI.Lessons on Objects that daily surround Children in the Parlor, Nursery,<br>  Garden, etc. Accounts of Trades and Employments.<br></p><p>  VII.Particular Duties of the Young—to Parents, Teachers, Brothers, Sisters,<br>  etc.<br></p><p>VIII.Bible Lessons and Stories</p><p>IX.Narratives—Such as are well authenticated—Original Tales</p><p>  X.Parables, Fables, and Proverbs, where the moral is obvious and excellent.<br></p><p>XI.Poetry—Adapted to the Youthful capacity and feelings.</p><p>  XII.Intelligence—Embracing Accounts of Juvenile<br>  <em>Books</em>  Societies, and<br>  <em>Remarkable Occurrences.</em></p><p>  Many of these subjects will be illustrated by numerous and beautiful<br>  engravings, prepared by the best artists , and selected not only with a view<br>  to<br>  <em>adorn</em>  the work, but to improve the taste, cultivate the mind, and raise the<br>  affections of the young to appropriate and worthy objects. We would make them<br>  better brothers, better sisters, better pupils, better associates, and, in the<br>  end, better citizens.<br></p><p>  We beg the friends of education—especially parents and teachers, to view the<br>  matter in this fight. Let children look upon the pictures, not as pictures<br>  <em>merely;</em>  but let them be taught to<br>  <em>study</em>  them. What can be more rich in valuable materials for instructive lessons than<br>  a good engraving?<br></p><p>  After this brief explanation of our principles and purposes, we ask the<br>  co-operation of all who receive this Circular. Will you aid us, by your<br>  influence, in this great work—the formation of mind and character for the<br>  rising generation? Will you assist us all in your power, in our endeavors to<br>  introduce to American schools, and parlors, and firesides, the stories and<br>  lessons of Parley’s Magazine?<br></p><p>  Every single number of the new volume will have a strong paper cover,<br>  abundantly sufficient to preserve the work in good order for binding and for<br>  use in schools.<br></p><p>  The yearly subscription being but one<br>  <em>dollar</em>  , our friends will perceive the impracticability of keeping open so many<br>  thousand accounts. It is therefore indispensable that we should require<br>  payment always in advance.<br></p><p>  Two numbers more will close the first year, and we now give this notice that<br>  all who desire to continue the Magazine, may signify their intention by a<br>  seasonable advance for the second year.<br></p><p>  In any of the subscribers should not receive all their numbers, they can<br>  request the Post-Master to notify us of such as are missing, and they shall be<br>  sent again free of charge.<br></p><p>TEN COPIES FREE OF POSTAGE.</p><p>  To accommodate ASSOCIATIONS, SCHOOLS, and INDIVIDUALS, for distributions, we<br>  will deliver at any Post-Office in the United States,<br>  <em>free of postage,</em>  TEN COPIES TO ONE ADDRESS for TEN dollars remitted to us without cost.<br></p><p>LILLY, WATT, and CO., Boston</p><p></p>",

    "commentary": "John Prentice and Daniel Tibbets were men of strong anti-slavery sentiments. John Prentice attended the 1833 organizational meeting of the American Anti-Slavery Society. In fact, John Prentice introduced a motion at the meeting in approbation of Prudence Crandall and the Canterbury Female Academy. Similarly, he was in the Providence Anti-Slavery Association, where, in 1833, he served as Treasurer. Others on the board include Henry E. Benson and Ray Potter. <p>Providence Anti-Slavery Society; <em>The Reports and Proceedings<br>  of the First Annual Meeting of the Providence Anti-Slavery Society.&nbsp; With<br>  a Brief Exposition of the Principles and Purposes of the Abolitionists.&nbsp;</em>  Providence: H.H.Brown, 1833<br></p>In May 1834, both Prentice and Tibbets signed a petition to President Jackson protesting the Bank situation.

The employment of the School Master,<br>  once so useful and dear to me, does now, at times, call me back to the<br>  examination of letters, syllables, words, spellings and readings. Perhaps I<br>  mingle with all these some political considerations; for I confess, that my<br>  anxiety for the preservation and perpetuation of our Union and National<br>  Government, is so great, that I often ardently wish all the children in the<br>  United States could be taught to read from the same set of books. Not because<br>  this might give a uniformity of pronunciation throughout the country, so<br>  desirable to Poets and Orators; but more than this, because the same juvenile<br>  literature studied and read, in the same language, would go far to give to<br>  each succeeding generation not only the same knowledge, but something like a<br>  brotherhood of feelings, sentiments, and opinions, than could, in any other<br>  way be obtained. I know you as a citizen, feel a deep interest in all this;<br>  and because you, as one of the highly useful and laborious fraternity of<br>  Printers and venders of books, may have a peculiar interest in some of those<br>  put forth for the instruction of children, I shall, at this time, press on<br>  your attention this subject in connexion with the best which I have yet seen.<br></p><p>  Our worthy fellow-citizen, Mr. Oliver Angell, seems to have had purposes much<br>  akin to my wishes, when he composed and published his system of classics for<br>  children. He had named his books the “Union;” and if you look quite through<br>  them, you will find nothing in the whole, for the reading of children, but<br>  that spirit and those principles which alone can preserve the Union, the<br>  purest morals, piety and patriotism. There is, also, a progression in the<br>  readings found in these books, admirably contrived to go along with that of<br>  the human mind in its growth from childhood up to perfect maturity.<br></p><p>  In mere orthography, the alphabet, the vowels, consonants, dipthongs,<br>  syllables, spellings, perhaps Mr. Angell might have done better for the<br>  <em>Instructor</em>  who may use his books; but after all, it will be found doubtful if any one can<br>  do better for the<br>  <em>Pupil</em>  for whom this good man seems alone to have been solicitous. The Instructor<br>  should carry in his head, the correct pronunciation of every word in our<br>  spoken language, and a key for all the various sounds of every letter in all<br>  its various combinations whenever he looks at that language as it is printed<br>  or written.<br></p><p>  We have more vowels in our spoken than in our printed or written language; and<br>  those who compose spelling books have supplied the deficiency by figures added<br>  to the printed character of each vowel. These Algebraic vowels, half letter,<br>  half figure, used in spelling books, are not printed in books of any other<br>  kind; so that a child, though he may have learned the different sounds of the<br>  printed vowels and can pronounce them when he spells; yet when he comes to<br>  read in other books, where one half of each vowel is omitted and it becomes<br>  thereby a new letter, he knows not how to pronounce it; and he must, at last,<br>  learn its different sounds in the different combinations of each with other<br>  letters. This would have been easier done, at first, when he was spelling,<br>  than, at last, when he is reading. Last or first, he must learn them, from the<br>  Instructor, or from the dictionary; and the Algebraic vowels, called the key,<br>  while useful to the Instructors themselves not well instructed, may be<br>  detrimental to the pupil. On the whole, I have seen no system of School Books<br>  equal, or any where near equal to Mr. Angell’s Union; and I think if they<br>  could be universally used in our English Schools in the whole country, our<br>  children would become not only better scholars, but better patriots, not less<br>  citizens of Rhode-Island, or South-Carolina and more citizens of the United<br>  States.<br></p><p>I am dear Sir, very truly, your obedient servant.</p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>  TRISTAM BURGES.<br></p><p>  <em>From the Preceptors of the Public Schools in the City of Providence</em></p><p>  We have used Mr. Angell’s series of school books, for nearly one eyar; and<br>  from this long trial we can say with confidence that we believe them admirably<br>  suited to answer the purposes for which they were composed. From our<br>  examination of the inferior numbers, which are used in the primary Schools, we<br>  believe them also to be no less useful. As reading books, they all combine in<br>  our opinion, many peculiar excellencies. The first, which will strike all who<br>  use them, is their perfect<br>  <em>adaptation</em>  to the<br>  <em>capacities</em>  of those for whom they were designed. This, we consider a most important<br>  advantage in an elementary book, and one which has not been heretofore<br>  sufficiently attended to.<br></p><p>  The books put into the hands of children at school have generally been<br>  altogether<br>  <em>above the understanding</em>  of the young mind; and the consequence has been, that the scholars have noy<br>  only made much less progress in a given time, but have acquired the lasting<br>  <em>disgust</em>  for their studies which has operated as an effectual bar to future<br>  improvement. To this great and extensive evil, Mr. Angell’s books afford a<br>  <em>certain and easy remedy.</em>  The facility with which his lessons are<br>  <em>understood</em>  added to their very interesting nature, causes them to be read by the scholar<br>  with eagerness and delight; by which means his love of study and his<br>  improvement in learning are both successfully promoted. The introduction of<br>  spelling lessons, in connection with reading lessons, into all the books, is<br>  an advantage which they possess over those previously in use. This<br>  arrangement, by enabling the pupil to become acquainted with each separate<br>  word, immediately before he is called to read them, is well calculated to<br>  render that exercise correct and pleasing, at the same time that it renders<br>  orthography a less dry and uninteresting study than the usual mode. It also<br>  considerably promotes economy by rendering the purchase of a separate spelling<br>  book unnecessary. The<br>  <em>appending of questions</em>  to each reading lesson we consider a very valuable improvement, since, by<br>  calling the attention of the pupil more closely to the subject, it will lead<br>  him to a better understanding of what is read. The natural gradation from what<br>  is easy, to what is more difficult, which is observed throughout this whole<br>  series, is a circumstance that renders them peculiarly valuable. Entertaining<br>  these opinions, we cheerfully recommend them to the attention of teachers and<br>  others interested in the cause of education; confident, that to all who are<br>  aware how much success in teaching depends upon proper books, they will be<br>  peculiarly acceptable.

In<br>  compliance with your request, I have examined “<br>  <em>Angell’s Union Series of Common School Classics,”</em>  and entertain a very favorable opinion of the work.

Their prominent characteristic is simplicity; and when the public<br>  mind has taken the stand, to which it seems rapidly advancing, that children<br>  and youth must understand what they read and what they learn, then at least<br>  the works of Mr. Angell will receive that patronage, which they so eminently<br>  deserve.

The eye, heart, and hand of<br>  christian faith looks, prays, and acts for its completion.<br></p><p>  But another reformation is needed in the church. It must be as separate from<br>  slavery, as from intemperance. The nation groans under the burden and misery<br>  and guilt of both these sins. It is the solemn duty of the church to clear<br>  itself from both these tremendous crimes. This is not addressed to the world,<br>  for the world legalizes the traffic in rum, and in the bodies and souls of<br>  men. But it is addressed to the children of God, who, if they know and do<br>  their duty, can have no possible connection with either of these trades. If<br>  increasing light has shown that christians ought not to buy and sell ardent<br>  spirits, much more it is believed, will increasing light show that christians<br>  ought not to buy human beings.<br></p><p>  The Rev. John Newton, even after he became pious, transported Africans in<br>  chains across the Atlantic, to be sold with their posterity into slavery.<br>  Could he have been a true christian, and have no upbraidings of conscience<br>  while so engaged? Yes. How is it possible? It was legal, and, at that time,<br>  honorable, and his mind was not enlightened.—Afterwards when it was he<br>  lamented his error. So there are in our country those who buy and sell their<br>  fellow beings, who, if their minds were enlightened, would lament and<br>  relinquish it.<br></p><p>  A few years ago, a man, whose whole daily earnings were required by his<br>  family, set up forty nights to run a distillery for forty dollars, which he<br>  gave to build a house of worship.—How could he think that money obtained by<br>  changing the bread of the poor, into the liquid fire of death, acceptable to<br>  God? Because his mind was in darkness. Would he do it now? No. Neither would<br>  the church now receive it. Why? Because the light of the temperance<br>  reformation has burst forth.<br></p><p>  Christians! who have promised supreme obedience to Him, that :tasted death for<br>  every man,: and more for the rich man, who, in a superb dress, rides in a<br>  superb carriage, to a superb church, to worship in superb style, than for the<br>  poor African, who pulls cotton in the “fields of Alabama, and naked as in the<br>  hour of birth, trembles under the blasts of mid winter”—on you is this call<br>  for a reformation in the church of that God, who declares himself no respector<br>  [sic] of persons.—Why do you exclude the dealer in ardent spirits from the<br>  communion table, and invite to it the dealer in human flesh? This could not,<br>  would not be, if there had been half so much effort made to show the utter<br>  abominations of christian slavery, as there has been to show the abominations<br>  of christian drunkenness. Whatever maybe the event of slavery and intemperance<br>  in the world a sufficiency of light will show, and cause to be removed<br>  these&nbsp; shocking deformities of the christian church. One denomination has<br>  already raised thousands of dollars to assist their brethren in becoming free<br>  from the deep stains of this awful sin. When will other denominations be<br>  equally sincere and active to cleanse themselves from this pollution? The<br>  answer is plain. When they are as conscientious and as much enlightened.<br></p><p>  To have light poured on this subject as its importance demands, it is proposed<br>  to raise fifty dollars, as a premium for the best essay on this deeply<br>  interesting subject.

On her cross examination, being asked if she named the<br>  subject of the smell at the time; did the evening after, to Miss P.

Judson Esq. opened on the part<br>  of the prosecution, D.P. Tyler Esq. opened on the part of the prisoner and was<br>  followed by the Hon. Calvin Goddard on the same side; C.F. Cleveland Esq.<br>  closed for the prosecution.—It seemed to be tacitly admitted that the fire was<br>  caused by design. The counsel for the prosecution claimed that the fire was<br>  communicated from within and that it was done by Olney. The opposing counsel<br>  insisted that the balance of proof was that the fire was communicated from<br>  without, but whether from within or from without, no testimony whatever had<br>  been adduced tending to show that Olney was guilty. The charge of his Honor<br>  Judge EATON was brief, but distinguished for its ability and impartiality. The<br>  jury retired, and after a short absence returned a verdict of<br>  <em>not guilty.</em></p><p>  The trial occupied the court from 2 o’clock in the afternoon of Thursday, till<br>  6 o’clock P.M. on Saturday.

On the 21<sup>st</sup>  .

On the 13<sup>th</sup>  of Feb. a reply having been received by the Governor, the Legislature met by<br>  special summons. The reply was then read, announcing that the wishes of the<br>  Legislature were perfectly consistent with the views of the government, and<br>  with the spirit of the Act of Parliament.

    "transcription": "<p>LAST ILLNESS OF WM. WIRT.</p><p>  The Richmond Compiler of the 17<sup>th</sup>  ult. contains an affecting account of the last illness of Mr. Wirt, written by<br>  a gentleman who attended him through that illness. We proceed to extract the<br>  principal part of it.—<br>  <em>Free Elector</em></p><p>  “On the evening of Saturday, the 8<sup>th</sup>  instant, he was in playful spirits, and sanguine of the success of an argument<br>  which he was to make in court on Monday. He felt better satisfied with his<br>  preparation, he said, than for any he had made for years before. On Sunday he<br>  walked to the Capitol to Church—it was a damp, chilly day, and the<br>  Representatives’ Hall was crowded and warm. To go immediately from it into the<br>  cold, damp air, and walk slowly, as he did, a mile to his lodgings, might have<br>  been deemed imprudent in one whose health was less precarious than his then<br>  seemed.<br></p><p>  ”That night he complained of a slight indisposition, and in the family worship<br>  of the evening prayed with an unusual fervor, and seemingly a foreboding<br>  spirit which he communicated not save to his God. But even this was sufficient<br>  to excite vague apprehensions in a family always ready to note and to dwell<br>  upon whatsoever might seem to bode danger or safety to a friend so dear.<br></p><p>  On Monday he was confined to his room; no serious apprehensions were<br>  entertained, but a physician was called in—it was only a cold. On Tuesday he<br>  was worse, but we feared not the result. He complained of stiffness of the<br>  muscles of the throat and swelling of the glands—milk poultices were applied<br>  to his face, but they gave not relief. On Wednesday he was much worse so much<br>  as to excite alarm; on the evening of this day it was first discovered that<br>  the disease was Erysipelas, ”a new enemy,” of which Mr. Wirt then expressed<br>  his fears. “It was not the foe with which he had been so long accustomed to<br>  contend.”<br></p><p>  His constitution was too weak, as the physicians apprehended, to stand the<br>  vigorous treatment which would have been most efficient in destroying the<br>  disease. By Friday, the alarm had become very serious—the door was crowded by<br>  anxious inquiring friends, and those who met in the street asked from each<br>  other the latest intelligence. The affliction of the family was extreme, but<br>  there was still hope. On Saturday, his daughter and son-in-law arrived from<br>  Baltimore, and were shocked to find the case so much worse than their worst<br>  fears.<br></p><p>  Scarcely a glimmer of hope was left to us, but this feeble ray was most<br>  anxiously watched and cherished. When once shadowed by so deep a gloom, the<br>  least of the twinkling stars in the firmament is more precious to our sight,<br>  than is the sun itself in the noontide of an unclouded day.<br></p><p>  Death from the first day of his illness, had continued to approach with a<br>  steady pace, and in a form more than usually hideous. The fine countenance so<br>  bright with intellect, was sadly altered—by the disease partly, and partly by<br>  remedies so fruitlessly applied. The eyes had lost their speculation—the<br>  eloquent voice was hushed—the divinity had departed from the temple, and its<br>  walls were defaced, but light still lingered, loath to abandon a habitation<br>  which had so long given to a thing in itself so little desirable and so<br>  worthless, beauty, purity, and worth.<br></p><p>  The attending physicians were Doctors Hunt and Hall; none could have been more<br>  anxiously attentive; the latter staid by him every night of the last four or<br>  five.<br></p><p>  About noon on Monday, consciousness returned; and he had power to speak a few<br>  words. Nature had made a last effort to permit him to take leave of his family<br>  and friends, to give them assurance that he died in christian hope, and to<br>  join them in prayer to his God. The Rev. Mr. Post officiated. In so much of<br>  the prayer as related to his family and his own acceptance with heaven, he<br>  seemed heartily to join—but when a petition was offered that he might be<br>  restored to health, he audibly dissented “no, no!” He had done and suffered<br>  enough in this contentious world, and was entitled to the release and the<br>  transfer to a higher existence, which the good and just are authorized to<br>  expect.<br></p><p>  It was now become manifest, even to the most sanguine, that recovery was<br>  beyond the remotest probability. He was too shining a mark for death longer to<br>  miss. All that was left to us was to smooth his passage to the tomb—to moisten<br>  his parched lips and tongue, and perform such little offices of affection as<br>  might soothe his last sufferings.<br></p><p>  During the last eighteen hours, he was tranquil as a child. Breathing and<br>  warmth were the only evidence of life—no motion, no pain, no consciousness,<br>  there lay the wreck of WILLIAM WIRT.<br></p><p>  Three friends besides the clergymen attended his bedside during the night—his<br>  family to, worn as they were by nearly a week’s constant watching, could not<br>  be induced to take repose. Anguish and affection gave them strength to bear<br>  what would have exhausted the strongest men It was a night long to be<br>  remembered—a night of silent, despairing sorrow, which conveys to the heart a<br>  language never to be forgot, a language which is not for a pen like mine to<br>  transcribe.<br></p><p>  Tuesday morning breaks upon the scene still unaltered, save that life<br>  fluttered more faintly and all pulse was gone. About 11 o’clock the breathing<br>  became gradually more distant and more feeble—was suspended or<br>  imperceptible—another breath—he’s gone! So calm, so imperceptibly did he make<br>  his exit, that the precise moment of his departure could scarcely be<br>  marked—without a sign or a struggle his bright spirit has departed from<br>  amongst us to a state o existence higher, mightier, and more glorious.<br></p><p>  Upon a highly excited mind a slight incident will sometimes make a deep and<br>  lasting impression. As the last flickerings of life were failing—while his<br>  whole family, and the friends who had watched with them, were grouped around<br>  his bed, and In silent, deep attention to the awful scene, all held their<br>  breath, and their hearts and pulse stood still, a few soft, low notes from a<br>  pet bird, which had before been so silent that its presence in the room was<br>  unremarked, fell with startling sweetness on the ear. Only once before during<br>  his illness, had it been known to sing. On the preceding day,, at the<br>  conclusion of the last act of devotion in which he ever joined, these same<br>  soft notes had mingled with the solemn ‘Amen.’<br></p><p></p>",
    "commentary": "William Wirt (1772-1834) was a long-serving Attorney General of the United States, but is best-remembered today for defending the rights of the Cherokees in the case that later so sadly spiraled down into the Trail of Tears. Wirt was also the first Presidential candidate of the Anti-Masonic party, in 1832.",

He introduced among<br>  barbarians the arts and the courtesies of civilized life—and he paved the way<br>  to the grandeur of the Russian Empire. His name is never mentioned by a<br>  Russian but with the utmost veneration and respect. Peter the Great was a<br>  <em>practical Mechanic.</em>  He was a carpenter and a blacksmith—and his tools are not preserved with great<br>  care in the Museum of St. Petersburgh, and are pointed out to strangers with<br>  all the marks of devotion which are exhibited by good Catholics, when exposing<br>  to the unhallowed gaze of heretics, the holiest relics.<br></p><p>  Peter built one of the noblest maritime cities in the world, and thither<br>  removed his Court.

He facilitated communication through the different parts of his<br>  immense Empire by making public roads, some of which were upwards of<br>  <em>one thousand miles in length!</em>  He established manufactories of various kinds—the first of which was pins.

After marriage the husband never allowed the<br>  wife to be seated at the same table with him—he could even kill her with<br>  impunity. On the other hand, a woman who murdered her husband was sentenced to<br>  be buried alive!

    "transcription": "<p>From Zerah Colburn’s Memoirs.</p><p>A REMARKABLE INCIDENT.</p><p>  “In the beginning of 1815, a circumstance took place that excited much<br>  interest in Paris. A surgeon in the army, named Dautun, was arrested in a<br>  gambling house, in the Palais Royal, on the testimony of a scar on his wrist.<br>  Some time previous, the officers of the night had found while passing their<br>  rounds, in different parts of the city, four parcels tied up; one containing<br>  the head, another the trunk, a third the thighs, and a fourth the legs and<br>  arms of a man. In the teeth, tightly compressed, was a piece of human flesh,<br>  apparently torn out in the dying struggle. The parts were collected, and put<br>  together in their regular order, and exhibited for a number of days at the<br>  Morgue. The mystery which involved this dark transaction excited quite an<br>  interest, and numbers went to see the corpse. The general and only conviction<br>  was the he must have been murdered; but for a number of weeks no clue was<br>  obtained to elicit information on the subject. When it became at length<br>  improper to keep the body any longer above ground, a cast in plaster was<br>  taken, fully representing the murdered victim, and this remained a much longer<br>  time for the public to see. At length Dauton happened to be engaged in<br>  gambling at the Palais Royal; he played high and lost, called for liquor to<br>  drink, and angry because the waiter was somewhat tardy, when he came with it<br>  Dauton emptied the glass and threw it at the waiter. It was shivered into a<br>  thousand pieces, and a fragment was carried into Dautun’s wrist, // under the<br>  cuff of his coat. The spectators gathering around, and learning the accident,<br>  wished to see the gash; he drew down his sleeve, and firmly pressed it round<br>  his wrist; they insisted on seeing it, he obstinately refused. By this course,<br>  the bystanders were at length led to suppose that something mysterious was<br>  involved in this conduct, and they determined at all events to see his wrist.<br>  By force they pushed up his sleeve, and behold a scar recently healed, as if<br>  made by tearing out of flesh, appeared. The landlord had been at Morgue, and<br>  seen the murdered man with the flesh between the teeth, and it struck him in a<br>  moment that the flesh was torn from this man’s wrist. Charging them to keep<br>  him safe, he hastened to call in the legal authorities, and arrested him.<br></p><p>  In the event, Dautun confessed that being quartered at Sedan, and out of<br>  money, he came to Paris to try some adventure. Knowing that his brother had a<br>  large sum by him, directly on his arrival, he went to his lodgings in a<br>  retired part of the city, about eight in the evening. He entered the house<br>  unnoticed by the porter, and passing to his apartment, found his brother<br>  asleep. He immediately commenced the work of death; his brother waking up<br>  defended himself, but in addition to the surprise and horror of the moment,<br>  being in a feeble state of health, all the desperation of his struggle was<br>  overpowered. In the scuffle he tore out the flesh. Being killed, the surgeon<br>  cut up the body, tied it up in four parcels as before mentioned, secured the<br>  money and retired.<br></p><p>  He also confessed that eleven months previous he had murdered an aunt, who was<br>  living with a second husband, to obtain money. Her husband was arrested and<br>  imprisoned for a number of months, but as nothing appeared to criminate him,<br>  he had been discharged. The writer saw the unhappy fratricide on his way from<br>  the prison to the place of execution.<br></p>",

Hartford, 1<sup>st</sup>  Rep. W. Hungerford 965 to 833; 2d “______ Hanks 932 to 798 both Anti Jackson<br>  men. In E. Hartford, E. Windsor, (majority 140) Enfield, Manchester,<br>  (reported) Wethersfield, Middletown, Durham, Winchester, Coventry, (reported)<br>  Avon, have gone Anti-Jackson. Southington doubtful. Glastonbury, Suffield and<br>  Mansfield are reported to have gone for Jackson candidates.<br></p><p>  THE ELECTION.—The returns so far as received, give strong indications that<br>  Jacksonism in this State is prostrated. Last year every town in the 13<sup>th</sup>  District was represented by Jackson men, now only one Jackson man* goes from<br>  this district. The 14<sup>th</sup>  District had two or three representatives who were either wholly Jackson men,<br>  or sometimes acted as such; now we believe not a man goes from that district<br>  who is not decidedly Anti-Jackson. Last year the Jackson party carried one of<br>  the Senators in this county. This year both Senators are Anti-Jackson, and<br>  elected by decisive majorities. Instead of a respectable majority<br>  <em>for</em>  Pearl, as was the case last year, the 13<sup>th</sup>  District now gives more than 300 majority<br>  <em>against</em>  him. The intelligence which we have received from other quarters is of much<br>  the same character. Hartford, represented last year by Jackson men, has now<br>  elected the Anti-Jackson candidates by nearly 150 majority. In several other<br>  towns from which we have heard, similar changes have taken place. There is<br>  scarce room for doubt that Governor Edwards will be elected—to quit the office<br>  as soon as his present term expires, and that the whole Anti-Jackson State<br>  ticket will succeed, if not already chosen by the people. We would not affect<br>  an indifference which we do not feel at this result, for it is the<br>  accomplishment of the wish which we expressed in our prospectus, that the rule<br>  of the present dynasty might be brief; but though we rejoice, we feel no<br>  disposition to indulge in extravagant exultation at the defeat of Jacksonism.<br></p><p>  * With the exception of one, who, however, if we have been rightly informed,<br>  generally acted with that party in the Legislature.<br></p>",

    "transcription": "We finish this week, the Report of Mr. Olney’s Trial, as furnished us by MR.<br>FOSTER, a young gentleman of acknowledged skill and fidelity as a reporter; and<br>in this presenting to the public an impartial statement of the testimony in the<br>case, we cannot but repeat our expression of astonishment that a man should have<br>been arrested and bound over for trial, against whom there was not a shadow of<br>proof—not even enough to have fixed suspicion upon a man of generally suspicious<br>character, much less upon Olney, whose character stands as fair, as that of any<br>person concerned in his arrest, examination, or trial. A man who can come out<br>from such a trial, not only with a triumphant acquittal, but with a character so<br>perfectly fair and unimpeached, notwithstanding all the pains which had been<br>taken beforehand to hunt up something against him—the inquiries among his<br>fellow-townsmen, where a man’s errors are likely to be known if he has committed<br>any serious ones—has certainly abundant reason to complain of the injustice of<br>being subject to so much trouble and expense on so slight grounds—rather so<br>utterly without any grounds, as Mr. Olney has been. We do not much wonder that<br>the Advertiser, the organ of those concerned in the arrest and prosecution of<br>Olney, should contain a Report of the evidence, (probably from the pen of Judson<br>himself, or some of his partizans,) so discolored in various parts, as to have<br>quite a different impression on the mind of readers who heard none of the<br>testimony, from that which the testimony itself would have left if they had<br>heard it. We do not much wonder, for instance, that the Advertiser’s report<br>should entirely leave out that part of Maria Robinson’s testimony in which she<br>says that Mr. Olney had not been alone in the room more than a minute before the<br>fire was discovered, thus showing it to have been absolutely impossible that he<br>could have fired the house. We mention this as one example of the accuracy of<br>that report, but any one who will compare it carefully with Mr. Foster’s, will<br>find many other features of dissimilarity calculated to weaken the strongly<br>unfavorable impressions which an accurate report would have produced, towards<br>those at whose instance Olney was arrested.<br>",
    "commentary": "In this further commentary on the acquittal of Frederick Olney, we learn that the <em>Windham Advertiser</em> had been publishing misleading partial reports on the trial, and had left out Mariah Robinson's key testimony - another erasure of a Black woman.",

    "transcription": "<p>COMMUNICATIONS.</p><p>For the Unionist.</p><p>  MR. EDITOR—Old Plainfield is “redeemed, regenerated and disenthralled” from<br>  the degrading bondage of Jack-onism. “We have met the enemy and they are<br>  ours.” Last year we gave a majority for Pearl as Senator, and had besides the<br>  honor and felicity of being represented in the Assembly by one thorough-going,<br>  avowed Jacksonman and one who though not nominally a Jacksonian is said to<br>  have always acted with that party, with as much fidelity as if he had been one<br>  of them. Now you know, Mr. Editor, this shows a laudable contempt of party<br>  trannels, for certainly no one ought to refuse his support to good measures,<br>  merely because they are the measures of the opposite party, and if the<br>  measures of the opposite party happen to be<br>  <em>all</em>  right, why, they ought<br>  <em>all</em>  to be supported—and yet, you know, it would hardly be right even in that case<br>  for a man to<br>  <em>desert</em>  his own party. So we suppose our representative thought; but I did not sit<br>  down to tell you about last year, any more than just enough to give you a<br>  better idea of what we did this. Considerable activity was displayed by both<br>  sides in the electioneering campaign before hand. The Jackson recruiting<br>  sergeants were flying about with great spirit, sensible, doubtless, that their<br>  case being desperate required a desperate effort. And you may depend upon it,<br>  our friends did not look on and see all the bustle of the Heroites with folded<br>  hands and half closed eyes. They were awake and warning the honest people of<br>  the tricks and maneuvres of the self-styled democratic party, and the people<br>  needed only a word of caution to put them on their guard. The Jackson leaders,<br>  after beating up for recruits, and counting noses all about town, came to the<br>  conclusion, it seems, (and a pretty correct conclusion it was too,) that if<br>  they attempted to run a full-blooded, acknowledged worshipper of their idol,<br>  they should only run their head against a post, at the very first push; so<br>  making up their minds that policy (not that which the old proverb calls “the<br>  best policy” neither, for of that our Jackson leaders would be forced to say<br>  as David did of the armor with which Saul girded him, “I have not assayed<br>  it,”) must supply the place of strength, they pitched upon a worthy man whose<br>  temper and disposition they considered such that they could mould him to about<br>  the right shape when elected, but who has never been called a Jackson man, and<br>  whom, in fact, they took care themselves to represent as no Jackson man, and<br>  him they resolved to run for their first candidate. To make the trick work the<br>  better, they took some pains to create an impression among the genuine<br>  republicans that this gentleman was to be one of the candidates of the<br>  republican party, hoping no doubt thereby to divide our ranks, and by uniting<br>  all the Jackson strength with a part of ours, to defeat our regular ticket,<br>  and thus dishearten us, and run with increased strength for their second<br>  candidate, who we shrewdly guessed would be the Chief Judge of our County<br>  Court—the same who was sent from our town last year. But though the plan was<br>  cunningly formed, and all preliminary measures taken with admirable skill,<br>  still somehow it wouldn’t work. Though some of the republicans—not aware<br>  probably of the plot—voted with the Jacksonians, yet the greater part were too<br>  wide awake to be managed in that sort, as the vote declared. For the first<br>  representative 287 votes were cast, of which Mr Goff, our candidate, received<br>  157, Mr. Cady, the<br>  <em>not Jackson</em>  candidate of the Jackson party, 74, Judge Eaton 2 or 3, and two of three<br>  others one apiece.<br></p><p>  This result was a damper, and as a natural consequence led them to relinquish<br>  the first order of battle, and instead of risking the Judge, to try their<br>  former candidate again; but some of the subalterns not getting their cue soon<br>  enough, had begun with commendable zeal to distribute votes for Mr. Eaton and<br>  had gone at least far enough to satisfy us what the original plan was, before<br>  they were stopped by the higher authorities. Not that the superior officers<br>  were at all negligent or remiss in checking the well meant, but ill judged<br>  activity of their less prudent partizans as soon as they discovered what was<br>  going on, for I chanced to see one of them, an<br>  <em>illustrious</em>  member of the bar, as well as sharer in some small degree of the “spoils” of<br>  former campaigns, stepping about quite nimbly and giving the necessary orders<br>  to restore, as far as possible, that union which they had like to have lost by<br>  their own maneuvres. The result of the over forward promptitude of the<br>  subalterns appeared on counting the votes for a second representative, when it<br>  was found that 238 had been case—153 for Mr. Knight, our candidate, —62 for<br>  Mr. Cady, and some dozen or twenty or such a matter for Mr. Eaton.<br></p><p>  The votes for Senator, Governor &amp;c. exhibited a still more cheering<br>  result, but as you will probably insert them at length, I shall add nothing<br>  respecting them, except that I was pleased to see how the freeman stood at<br>  their posts instead of quitting as they too often do, immediately on the<br>  choice of representatives. This appears from the number of votes given for<br>  each officer. First Representative 237, second do. 233, Senator 235, Governor<br>  237. I have already told you how the Jacksonites carried matters last year,<br>  and I will add that by referring to the Presidential vote in 1832, I find that<br>  Jacksonism has sustained a net loss in this town since that time, of about 60<br>  votes.<br></p><p>  (<br>  <em>signed</em>  ) PLAINFIELD REPUBLICAN<br></p>",

    "transcription": "<p>  WESTMINSTER, April 8<sup>th</sup>  , 1834<br></p><p>  Mr. Editor, “How are the mighty fallen!” Jacksonism and Judsonism, recently so<br>  flourishing in Canterbury have met a sad and total overthrow. All the efforts<br>  of our gallant Col. to ride into office on the storm of an anti-negro<br>  excitement have utterly failed, and discomfited and chagrined, the Col.<br>  declares, as I am told, that the Canterbury people may take care of the black<br>  school for themselves—he fights against it no longer. Alas for us! Who shall<br>  now head our opposition against that nuisance, that abomination in our eyes!<br>  Verily, if the Col. deserteth the post he has so bravely occupied the past<br>  year, it will be to the opposers of the school “as when a standard bearer<br>  fainteth.” But I intended to tell you something of the contest, which has<br>  terminated in such a disastrous overthrow of the Col’s party here. At our<br>  first trial for representative, we failed of making a choice, and Col. Judson<br>  had a plurality of two or three votes or so over Baldwin. The second trial<br>  however shoed the Col’s folks how the freemen when fairly waked up, could<br>  “shed fast atonement for the first delay.” The Col. had the leave of about 60<br>  majority of the electors, to enjoy the sweets of domestic felicity and of<br>  neighborly intercourse with his kind friends on the green, uninterrupted by<br>  the cares of office.<br></p><p>  We now tried for our second representative, and I leave you to guess how the<br>  subjects of two Andrew’s twisted and turned to get their beloved in. Mr. Lyon<br>  of course could not expect to take the second chance if the Col himself lost<br>  the first so he stood back as in duty bound, for his superior officer, and the<br>  struggle was between Clarke and Judson. Now we Westminster chaps have an idea<br>  that Clarke is about as fit for any office in our gift as the Archbishop is,<br>  or ever was, and so we gave him to understand as much by our votes. We have no<br>  notion of supporting black laws or black law men, or Jacksonmen or Judsonmen.<br>  The Col’s efforts to buy up the Antimasons by an offer of a share in the<br>  spoils of victory proved unavailing. Our Antimasionic neighbors think that<br>  those who offer the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them, or any part<br>  and parcel thereof, had better be sure they have them to give, before<br>  <em>they</em>  fall down and worship, for such considerations, and then they won’t bow the<br>  knee to<br>  <em>such</em>  a Baal as our Judsonian friends set up. Mr. Judson accordingly was again<br>  notified by 70 majority, that we don’t want him to go to New-Haven on our<br>  account this year. I presume he understands our meaning by this time, for if<br>  he didn’t comprehend it at two intimations, he must have begun to guess what<br>  it was by the time we had given about a hundred majority against his<br>  candidates for Senator, Governor &amp;c.<br></p><p>OLD WESTMINSTER</p><p></p>",

    "source": "<em>The Unionist</em> 1834-04-10",
    "subject": "Abolition",
    "transcription": "<p>  It is almost mathematically certain that the Colonization Society with its<br>  present sentiments and organization, can never effect the abolition of slavery<br>  in the United States. This Society was organized, January 14, 1817. During the<br>  seventeen years of its existence it has, (free blacks aside) transported on an<br>  average almost sixty a year who had been slaves, but which were not<br>  emancipated by the society. The increase of our slave population is known to<br>  be about 60 thousand a year, or about 170 a day. Should things continue in<br>  this ratio, it may be seen, that while the society (bankruptcy of $40,000<br>  aside) is transporting one emancipated black to Liberia, which it has done<br>  nothing toward manumitting, more than a thousand have been added by births!<br>  When a distinguished friend, therefore, of the society acknowledges that if<br>  the society should remove the whole in a hundred years it is as soon as could<br>  reasonably be expected, has he not fixed the period quite too soon? Would not<br>  the end of time be quite a probable? Besides, who can doubt that from a<br>  population of 2,000,000 as many as that would have been manumnitted had no<br>  such society existed. And had the funds which have been expended for their<br>  outfit, transportation, and mal-administration of the colony, been<br>  appropriated to their education and comfortable settlement in this their<br>  native country, how much more honorable as well as righteous in those who have<br>  so long and sorely oppressed them!<br></p><p>  A New-England citizen thinks he has presented the public with a good offset to<br>  calculations like the above, by stating that Mr. G. (the American Wilberforce)<br>  has been engaged for several years, and the Anti-Slavery society two years and<br>  have emancipated one boy in Boston. And thinks the enquiry :When will the<br>  society remove the entire population of our country?” will apply with more<br>  force to the Anti-Slavery society, than that of the Colonization. And<br>  especially (he thinks) as when it is remembered that laws preventing<br>  emancipation and oppressing the colored people, have been passed in many<br>  states since the Liberator and other similar publications have been in<br>  circulation. But who does not see a wide difference in the prospective view of<br>  these societies, As the Colonization Society disavows any intention to<br>  interfere with the RIGHT of the slave holder, why, of course, he may dwell in<br>  peaceable fellowship with him forever, whether he is willing to release<br>  another slave or not. Now the Anti-slavery Society not only avows for its<br>  object the abolition of slavery entirely, but its object is to act on the<br>  entire population EN MASSE whose prerogative it is to remove oppressive laws,<br>  and to awaken and correct public sentiment on this subject, against which no<br>  system of wickedness can long hold out, whether legalised or not. The<br>  emancipation of the boy in Boston therefore, is but an incidental affair;<br>  while at the same time it is a test of the society’s sincerity and efficiency.<br>  Should the Colonization Society ever exceed the prescribed limits of their<br>  object, so as to turn their attention to an enslaved boy in Boston or<br>  elsewhere, it will doubtless refuse to incur the expense and trouble of a<br>  prosecution and wait patiently the pleasure of his holder to voluntarily<br>  release him, which perhaps will be at the termination of the slave’s life.<br></p><p>  While therefore, the above mentioned case is a test of the vigor of the<br>  society, it may also stand like the Egyptian which Moses slew and the Hebrew<br>  which he defended, prelusive of the final and complete deliverance of that<br>  unhappy and enslaved people. He supposed that his brethren would by his hand<br>  deliver them; “<br>  <em>but they understood it not.</em>  ” As to the oppressive laws enacted since the efforts of the friends of<br>  liberty, I should hardly have thought that a man with the views and feelings<br>  of a New-England man would have dared to utter them, as it cannot fail to call<br>  up to the mind of every reader the policy of Pharaoh and his counsellors. It<br>  appears then, that there is the strongest analogy between the two immediate<br>  precursors of the Hebrew’s deliverance, and circumstances among ourselves,<br>  viz: their increase of population and their increased oppression; “and when<br>  the time drew near” “the people grew and multiplied in Egypt. Acts VII, 17.<br>  “For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to this<br>  people; neither hast thou delivered them at all.” Ex. V-23. I hope the<br>  opposition will not be carried to the same extent as it was by the<br>  Anti-abolitionists of Egypt, because I love my country. It is believed by many<br>  thinking men that slavery cannot hold out thirty years longer in this country;<br>  and that its extermination, or the dissolution of our union is near. If these<br>  men are fanatics, is it not a little singular that they are so on this subject<br>  only?<br></p><p>  The reason which a “New-England man” and others love to assign why they cannot<br>  co-operate with abolitionists is, that Mr.G. has uttered and published some<br>  extravagant things. This objection is as unsatisfactory as it is disingenuous.<br>  Many of the friends of the anti-slavery society have thought so too, and<br>  regretted it. Be this as it may, they think it unfair for the fourth of July<br>  orators to be constantly calling out those expressions, which they deem<br>  exceptionable, and presenting them in a garbled manner, without their<br>  qualifications, and in senses quite different from what was intended, and then<br>  attempting to fix an odium on the society. No allowance is made for the<br>  peculiar &amp; extraordinary situation in which Mr. G. Has been, and still is<br>  placed. He is the first man who has dared to publish a paper devoted to the<br>  cause of the oppressed colored man of this country. He has been thrown into<br>  prison; five thousand dollars offered for his apprehension&nbsp; by the<br>  legislature of a state, and two thousand five hundred by an association of<br>  <em>Gentlemen</em>  in S. Carolina, denounced as the verist fanatic that ever existed; and<br>  doubtless has enlisted a combination of the worst passions against himself,<br>  that ever occupied the human breast. No body doubts that Mr. G. has the most<br>  numerous and virulent enemies of any other individual in this country. Add to<br>  this that he has thrown his whole soul into the cause which he pleads, and who<br>  that retains a vestige of candor will refuse to overlook the sally of an<br>  unguarded expression, or make a man an offender for a word? If the objection<br>  above-mentioned by sufficient to justify the refusal to co-operate, why, on<br>  the same principle we may cling to Popery, and refuse to co-operate in the<br>  Protestant cause. Nothing tried the friends of Luther more than his violent<br>  and daring expressions. They were considered by both friends and foes as<br>  injurious to the cause he advocated; yet it is a question not fully settled<br>  whether a man less ardent and more prudent, would have succeeded quite as<br>  well. He // saw distinctly as did many others that his cause on the main was<br>  right; and many now perceive, (their number fast increasing) that the<br>  prominent features of the abolitionists are those of truth and justice, and<br>  will most assuredly prevail.&nbsp;&nbsp; N.B.

He is an<br>  abolitionist of the old school, and commenced at the earliest period with<br>  Clarkson and Wilberforce, for the suppression of the foreign slave trade.<br>  Although far advanced in years, he is in vigorous possession of his mental<br>  faculties; and his hand writing is firm and plain, to a marvel.<br></p><p>  “I observed in a late Boston paper, that the annual meeting of the Peace<br>  Society was to convene in that city. Several weeks since I addressed a letter<br>  to a friend in Hartford, who is actively engaged in the Pacific cause, and<br>  informed him that I considered the cause of Peace and the abolition of Slavery<br>  to be so inseparably connected, that wherever one society existed, the other<br>  should be located&nbsp; in its vicinity; and my opinion originates from the<br>  import of the sacred hymn, chanted by the angelic host at the advent of our<br>  blessed Saviour—‘Peace on earth and<br>  <em>good will to men.</em>  ’ And how can we exercise this good will on a more important and urgent<br>  occasion, than to rescue our fellow men from the matchless and oppressive<br>  cruelties of slavery?<br></p><p>  It is universally admitted that the first Congress in the United States was<br>  composed of the most pure and enlightened citizens, who, on the 6<sup>th</sup>  of July, 1775, announced the following sentiments:<br></p><p>  ‘If it were possible for men, who exercise their reason, to believe that the<br>  Divine Author of our existence intended a part of the human race to hold an<br>  absolute property in, and unbounded power over others, marked out by infinite<br>  goodness and wisdom, as the objects of a legal domination never rightfully<br>  resistible, however, however severe and oppressive—the inhabitants of these<br>  Colonies might at least require from the Parliament of Great Britain, some<br>  evidence that this dreadful authority over them has been granted to that<br>  body.’<br></p><p>  May not the poor slaves emphatically adopt the same inquiry of their lordly<br>  oppressors?<br></p><p>  Again, in 1779, a pamphlet appeared, published by order of Congress, which<br>  contains the following opinion:<br></p><p>  ‘The great principle (of government) I, that men are by nature free, as<br>  accountable to Him that made them, they must be so, and so long as we have any<br>  idea of Divine Justice, we must associate that of human freedom.’<br></p><p>  Now, it appears evident to me, that the above recited sentiments authorize and<br>  sanction an avowed opposition to slavery, and even censure those who think<br>  otherwise, as being destitute of any correct opinion of Divine Justice.<br></p>",

    "transcription": "<em>Important Discovery.</em>—We are informed by two gentleman who lately passed through Syracuse, that, N.Y.<br>that Mr. Avery, proprietor of an extensive iron foundry in that place, has made<br>a most important discovery in relation to the casting of iron. The best kind of<br>earth used in foundries, is brought we believe, from Canada. Mr. Avery analyzed<br>this earth and found it to contain proportion of blue clay. Following this up by<br>a series of experiments, he discovered that if common fine sand was mixed with<br>common blue clay in the proportion of one tenth part of clay to nine tenths of<br>sand, it would constitute the best composition for casting that he had ever<br>used. The most delicate casting came out free from sand; requiring no cleaning<br>by vitrol. He dismissed 10 of his cleaners on the spot. Mr. A. has taken out a<br>patent for the discovery, and thinks it will make an immense saving the expense<br>of iron foundries.—<br><em>Inquirer, Brattleboro.</em>",
    "commentary": "William Avery (1793-1840) was an inventor and manufactorer in New York State. His Syracuse iron foundry, E. Lynds & Co, helped revolutionize transport on the Great Lakes and the Erie Canal (see https://www.maritimehistoryofthegreatlakes.ca/Documents/Engines/default.asp?ID=s005 ). In his final years, he worked on the Illinois and Michigan Canal, but died suddenly before his part of the job was complete. Prudence Crandall would later live near the start of this canal in Mendota, Illinois. Avery had many patents to his name, but the most important was the Avery rotary engine, as described here - https://uh.edu/engines/epi1884.htm . An article in <em>Scientific American</em> March 17, 1894, p. 175-176 has more information on the rotary engine.",

    "subject": "Canterbury Female Academy; African-American Students; Education; Race; Vigilante Violence; Prudence Crandall; White Opposition",
    "transcription": "THE QUESTION SETTLED.----The Windham County Advertiser, (the determined opponent<br>of Miss Crandall,) in speaking of the late trial of Mr. Olney, says—It “was a<br>patient examination of facts, and<br><em>all who heard it admit that the fire was communicated by design.”</em>Very well. This settles one point, and we may say the only point in which the<br>American public at large, have any particular interest: and we will add, that on<br>that point, there is a most intense interest felt throughout the country. It is<br>simply this—Whether the house of Miss Crandall took fire by accident, or whether<br>it was fired by some person or persons, determined to<br><em>“break up”</em>the school. As to the miserable attempt to cast suspicion upon the friends of<br>the school, it will be an utter failure. Nobody of sound mind and principles<br>will listen to it. It is out of the question. Miss Crandall and her sister and<br>pupils are too well known, and too<br><em>favorably and honorably</em>known throughout the land, to be made objects of suspicion. A similar remark<br>might be made respecting Mr. Olney, who is well known in this city, and whose<br>character is as unimpeachable and well established as Judge Eaton’s. Besides, he<br>stands acquitted and “all” who heard the evidence, “admit that the fire was<br>communicated BY DESIGN!!!<br><em>This settles the question forever,</em>before the impartial jury of the American public, who will of necessity infer<br><em>that</em>&nbsp;the fire was communicated by the same class of persons who pelted the<br>house with stones and addled eggs, who filled the well with filth, and<br>threatened to “break up the school.” For the honor of human nature, and<br>especially of Windham county, (the land of our boyhood,) we had hoped that there<br>would remain some ground for the opinion that the fire was<br><em>accidental.</em>We are sorry to learn, and from the source least likely to admit it, that such<br>is not the fact. One question, however, of minor importance still remains to be<br>settled, and that is<br><em>which</em>of all the persons in high life and in low, that have so virulently opposed the<br>school of Miss Crandall, have been guilty of this base act? This question, which<br>it concerns the decent and respectable portion of those opponents, chiefly to<br>settle, is a question to which it would seem that the (fortunately for<br>themselves,) possess no unmeaning clue. One of their members (the editor of the<br>Advertiser) appears to have been favored, some time before hand, with intimation<br>of the fact, that an attempt would be made to “break up the school.” Let him<br>frankly reveal the source of his information, and let these informants be<br>required to name<br><em>their</em>informants, and so on, and there is little doubt that those villains will be<br>detected, and all honest men exculpated, at a cheaper rate than the adoption of<br>useless and abortive measures to thrown suspicion on the innocent.—<br><em>Emancipator</em>",
    "commentary": "The author identifies himself as some one who grew up in Windham County. The editor of <em>The Emancipator</em> Charles Denison, is a potential candidate, having been born in New London county, but potentially having lived in Windham later. Likewise, African-American activist and theorist David Ruggles was an agent of the paper. Ruggles' style matches this enthusiastic prose,The editorial prominently highlights the Black students as \"<em>favorably and honorably</em>known throughout the land\" as well as Prudence and Almira Crandall, a reframing of the usual publicity that indicates either a genuinely anti-racist white writer, or a Black writer whose position within the community would have made the students' respectability obvious to him.<br>",

During that<br>  short period the number of subscribers has increased to 20,000, and the work<br>  has received, every where, the most unqualified approbation. It has found its<br>  way to thousands of families, and while it has entertained the social circle,<br>  its unobtrusive lessons have, we trust, often had a<br>  <em>salutary influence</em>  on the<br>  <em>juvenile mind</em>  and<br>  <em>heart.</em>  It has also found its way to the school room; and many classes of young pupils<br>  have been cheered twice a month&nbsp; y the welcome voice of their teacher<br>  bidding them to lay aside for a few days, the class book which they have read<br>  over and over, perhaps twenty times, and read the pages of Parley’s Magazine.<br>  The demand for the work, to be used in schools, is rapidly increasing.<br></p><p>  Encouraged by such unexampled success, the Publishers have resolved to render<br>  it still more worthy so liberal a patronage; and not to remit their exertions<br>  till they see it introduced into families and schools, throughout the whole<br>  length and breadth of the United States.<br></p><p>  In this view they have secured new aid in the Editorial department. The late<br>  Editor of the Juvenile Rambler, who, in addition to his qualifications as a<br>  writer for the young, has the advantage of many years experience as a teacher,<br>  will henceforth assist in conducting it.<br></p><p>  We propose to present, in the progress of each volume, a great variety of<br>  interesting and important topics, among which are the following.<br></p><p>  I.Natural History—Of beasts, birds, fishes, reptiles, insects; plants,<br>  flowers, trees; the human frame, &amp;c.<br></p><p>II.Biography—Especially of the young.</p><p>III.Geography—Accounts of places, manners, customs, etc.</p><p>IV.Travels and Voyages, in various parts of the world.</p><p>  V.Lively Descriptions of the Curiosities of<br>  <em>Nature</em>  and<br>  <em>Art—</em>  in each of the United States, and in other countries.<br></p><p>  VI.Lessons on Objects that daily surround Children in the Parlor, Nursery,<br>  Garden, etc. Accounts of Trades and Employments.<br></p><p>  VII.Particular Duties of the Young—to Parents, Teachers, Brothers, Sisters,<br>  etc.<br></p><p>VIII.Bible Lessons and Stories</p><p>IX.Narratives—Such as are well authenticated—Original Tales</p><p>  X.Parables, Fables, and Proverbs, where the moral is obvious and excellent.<br></p><p>XI.Poetry—Adapted to the Youthful capacity and feelings.</p><p>  XII.Intelligence—Embracing Accounts of Juvenile<br>  <em>Books</em>  Societies, and<br>  <em>Remarkable Occurrences.</em></p><p>  Many of these subjects will be illustrated by numerous and beautiful<br>  engravings, prepared by the best artists , and selected not only with a view<br>  to<br>  <em>adorn</em>  the work, but to improve the taste, cultivate the mind, and raise the<br>  affections of the young to appropriate and worthy objects. We would make them<br>  better brothers, better sisters, better pupils, better associates, and, in the<br>  end, better citizens.<br></p><p>  We beg the friends of education—especially parents and teachers, to view the<br>  matter in this fight. Let children look upon the pictures, not as pictures<br>  <em>merely;</em>  but let them be taught to<br>  <em>study</em>  them. What can be more rich in valuable materials for instructive lessons than<br>  a good engraving?<br></p><p>  After this brief explanation of our principles and purposes, we ask the<br>  co-operation of all who receive this Circular. Will you aid us, by your<br>  influence, in this great work—the formation of mind and character for the<br>  rising generation? Will you assist us all in your power, in our endeavors to<br>  introduce to American schools, and parlors, and firesides, the stories and<br>  lessons of Parley’s Magazine?<br></p><p>  Every single number of the new volume will have a strong paper cover,<br>  abundantly sufficient to preserve the work in good order for binding and for<br>  use in schools.<br></p><p>  The yearly subscription being but one<br>  <em>dollar</em>  , our friends will perceive the impracticability of keeping open so many<br>  thousand accounts. It is therefore indispensable that we should require<br>  payment always in advance.<br></p><p>  Two numbers more will close the first year, and we now give this notice that<br>  all who desire to continue the Magazine, may signify their intention by a<br>  seasonable advance for the second year.<br></p><p>  In any of the subscribers should not receive all their numbers, they can<br>  request the Post-Master to notify us of such as are missing, and they shall be<br>  sent again free of charge.<br></p><p>TEN COPIES FREE OF POSTAGE.</p><p>  To accommodate ASSOCIATIONS, SCHOOLS, and INDIVIDUALS, for distributions, we<br>  will deliver at any Post-Office in the United States,<br>  <em>free of postage,</em>  TEN COPIES TO ONE ADDRESS for TEN dollars remitted to us without cost.<br></p><p>LILLY, WATT, and CO., Boston</p><p></p>",

    "transcription": "An Irish servant lad, going along the passage, and singing rather<br>inharmoniously, was asked by his master what horrid noise he was making? “I have<br>not made any noise, sir,” he replied. “Why, you were singing, and a confounded<br>noise it was.” “Oh, perhaps it was the singing of my ears your honor heard.”<br>This reminds us of a dialogue between two ministers of the gude kirk of<br>Scotland. One complained that he had got a ringing in his head. “Do ye ken the<br>reason o’ that?” asked his worthy crony. “Na!” “I’ll tell ye; ‘tis because it’s<br>empty!” “And have ye never a ringing in your head?” quoth the other. “Na,<br>never.” “And do ye ken the reason?,’ “Na.” “It’s because it’s cracked!” was the<br>retort; and the truth was not very far off.<br>",
    "commentary": "Humor based on ethnic stereotypes and denigration is, as usual, prevelant in the human condition but not our best feature. However, the reference to things which are cracked, this opens the window to consider the use of The Liberty Bell as a symbol by the Abolitionists. This is both because of its use of the Biblical phrase \"Proclaim LIBERTY Throughout all the Land unto all the Inhabitants Thereof\" (Leviticus 25:10), but also the patent lack of extending freedom to all the inhabitants that the persistence of slavery represented. The Abolitionists rescued the Liberty Bell from post-revolutionary obscurity and made it a potent icon for freedom once again.",

The literary department of<br>  the Lady’s Book is of admitted superiority; for in conjunction with the great<br>  but boasted liberality with which they encourage the development of<br>  <em>Native Authors,</em>  they possess facilities of selection, through their foreign agents and<br>  correspondents from works of which<br>  <em>no other copies</em>  are sent to this country.<br></p><p>  Among the many claims which the Lady’s Book has on the patronage of Americans,<br>  the least is not, that it was the first publication to present correct<br>  representations of the newest fashions of female costume, and in that respect<br>  it may fairly claim a superiority over all other contemporaries: for we<br>  proprietors seldom calculate the expense of rendering it altogether deserving<br>  of its increased and increasing patrons.<br></p><p>  Never was the title of a book more justified by its contents than that of the<br>  Lady’s Book—Literature, foreign and domestic—selected and original—Engravings<br>  on steel and wood, of scenery, distinguished persons, fashions and embroidery,<br>  all rich and beautiful, and from the hands of the most eminent artists. Its<br>  literature select, free from dullness, though teeming with usefulness, and<br>  conveying pleasure and amusement through the extensive medium of delicate<br>  discrimination. To musical amateurs of both sexes, the Lady’s Book offers many<br>  advantages, each number being accompanied by a popular piece, arranged with<br>  accompaniments for the piano forte, &amp;c &amp;c. under the<br>  <em>surveillance</em>  of competent persons, and to its pages the general reader can always turn and<br>  find amusement, novelty, and instruction.<br></p><p>  Each number shall, as hitherto, average 60 pages of extra royal octavo letter<br>  press, printed with clear, new and beautiful type, on paper of the finest<br>  texture and whitest colour. It will continue to be embellished with the most<br>  splendid engravings on copper and steel, embracing every variety of subject,<br>  and the quarterly numbers will as heretofore contain figures of Philadelphia<br>  Fashions, two and occasionally three, beautifully and faithfully colored, to<br>  commence with the January number, being No. 1 of the eighth volume.

The employment of the School Master,<br>  once so useful and dear to me, does now, at times, call me back to the<br>  examination of letters, syllables, words, spellings and readings. Perhaps I<br>  mingle with all these some political considerations; for I confess, that my<br>  anxiety for the preservation and perpetuation of our Union and National<br>  Government, is so great, that I often ardently wish all the children in the<br>  United States could be taught to read from the same set of books. Not because<br>  this might give a uniformity of pronunciation throughout the country, so<br>  desirable to Poets and Orators; but more than this, because the same juvenile<br>  literature studied and read, in the same language, would go far to give to<br>  each succeeding generation not only the same knowledge, but something like a<br>  brotherhood of feelings, sentiments, and opinions, than could, in any other<br>  way be obtained. I know you as a citizen, feel a deep interest in all this;<br>  and because you, as one of the highly useful and laborious fraternity of<br>  Printers and venders of books, may have a peculiar interest in some of those<br>  put forth for the instruction of children, I shall, at this time, press on<br>  your attention this subject in connexion with the best which I have yet seen.<br></p><p>  Our worthy fellow-citizen, Mr. Oliver Angell, seems to have had purposes much<br>  akin to my wishes, when he composed and published his system of classics for<br>  children. He had named his books the “Union;” and if you look quite through<br>  them, you will find nothing in the whole, for the reading of children, but<br>  that spirit and those principles which alone can preserve the Union, the<br>  purest morals, piety and patriotism. There is, also, a progression in the<br>  readings found in these books, admirably contrived to go along with that of<br>  the human mind in its growth from childhood up to perfect maturity.<br></p><p>  In mere orthography, the alphabet, the vowels, consonants, dipthongs,<br>  syllables, spellings, perhaps Mr. Angell might have done better for the<br>  <em>Instructor</em>  who may use his books; but after all, it will be found doubtful if any one can<br>  do better for the<br>  <em>Pupil</em>  for whom this good man seems alone to have been solicitous. The Instructor<br>  should carry in his head, the correct pronunciation of every word in our<br>  spoken language, and a key for all the various sounds of every letter in all<br>  its various combinations whenever he looks at that language as it is printed<br>  or written.<br></p><p>  We have more vowels in our spoken than in our printed or written language; and<br>  those who compose spelling books have supplied the deficiency by figures added<br>  to the printed character of each vowel. These Algebraic vowels, half letter,<br>  half figure, used in spelling books, are not printed in books of any other<br>  kind; so that a child, though he may have learned the different sounds of the<br>  printed vowels and can pronounce them when he spells; yet when he comes to<br>  read in other books, where one half of each vowel is omitted and it becomes<br>  thereby a new letter, he knows not how to pronounce it; and he must, at last,<br>  learn its different sounds in the different combinations of each with other<br>  letters. This would have been easier done, at first, when he was spelling,<br>  than, at last, when he is reading. Last or first, he must learn them, from the<br>  Instructor, or from the dictionary; and the Algebraic vowels, called the key,<br>  while useful to the Instructors themselves not well instructed, may be<br>  detrimental to the pupil. On the whole, I have seen no system of School Books<br>  equal, or any where near equal to Mr. Angell’s Union; and I think if they<br>  could be universally used in our English Schools in the whole country, our<br>  children would become not only better scholars, but better patriots, not less<br>  citizens of Rhode-Island, or South-Carolina and more citizens of the United<br>  States.<br></p><p>I am dear Sir, very truly, your obedient servant.</p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>  TRISTAM BURGES.<br></p><p>  <em>From the Preceptors of the Public Schools in the City of Providence</em></p><p>  We have used Mr. Angell’s series of school books, for nearly one eyar; and<br>  from this long trial we can say with confidence that we believe them admirably<br>  suited to answer the purposes for which they were composed. From our<br>  examination of the inferior numbers, which are used in the primary Schools, we<br>  believe them also to be no less useful. As reading books, they all combine in<br>  our opinion, many peculiar excellencies. The first, which will strike all who<br>  use them, is their perfect<br>  <em>adaptation</em>  to the<br>  <em>capacities</em>  of those for whom they were designed. This, we consider a most important<br>  advantage in an elementary book, and one which has not been heretofore<br>  sufficiently attended to.<br></p><p>  The books put into the hands of children at school have generally been<br>  altogether<br>  <em>above the understanding</em>  of the young mind; and the consequence has been, that the scholars have noy<br>  only made much less progress in a given time, but have acquired the lasting<br>  <em>disgust</em>  for their studies which has operated as an effectual bar to future<br>  improvement. To this great and extensive evil, Mr. Angell’s books afford a<br>  <em>certain and easy remedy.</em>  The facility with which his lessons are<br>  <em>understood</em>  added to their very interesting nature, causes them to be read by the scholar<br>  with eagerness and delight; by which means his love of study and his<br>  improvement in learning are both successfully promoted. The introduction of<br>  spelling lessons, in connection with reading lessons, into all the books, is<br>  an advantage which they possess over those previously in use. This<br>  arrangement, by enabling the pupil to become acquainted with each separate<br>  word, immediately before he is called to read them, is well calculated to<br>  render that exercise correct and pleasing, at the same time that it renders<br>  orthography a less dry and uninteresting study than the usual mode. It also<br>  considerably promotes economy by rendering the purchase of a separate spelling<br>  book unnecessary. The<br>  <em>appending of questions</em>  to each reading lesson we consider a very valuable improvement, since, by<br>  calling the attention of the pupil more closely to the subject, it will lead<br>  him to a better understanding of what is read. The natural gradation from what<br>  is easy, to what is more difficult, which is observed throughout this whole<br>  series, is a circumstance that renders them peculiarly valuable. Entertaining<br>  these opinions, we cheerfully recommend them to the attention of teachers and<br>  others interested in the cause of education; confident, that to all who are<br>  aware how much success in teaching depends upon proper books, they will be<br>  peculiarly acceptable.

Very respectfully—Your<br>  ob’t Servant, J. O’CONNER. Principal of the Classical and English Academy,<br>  rear of St. Stephen’s Church, and Recording Secretary of the “Philadelphia<br>  Association of Teachers.”<br></p><p>  <em>    From Robert Vaux, Esq. of Philadelphia, who was for a number of years<br>    President of the Board of Controllers of the Public Schools for the City and<br>    County of Philadelphia.<br>  </em></p><p>  TO MARSHALL, CLARK &amp; CO. SCHOOL BOOK PUBLISHERS, PHILADELPHIA. In<br>  compliance with your request, I have examined “<br>  <em>Angell’s Union Series of Common School Classics,”</em>  and entertain a very favorable opinion of the work. It comprises a course of<br>  elementary lessons on simple and practical principles, and so far as I can<br>  discover, imparts throughout, knowledge to instruct the understanding and to<br>  purify the heart. In common with all productions of like character I could<br>  wish for extensive circulation in our country. ROBERT VAUX.<br></p><p>  <em>    From Roswell C. Smith, Esq.

Their prominent characteristic is simplicity; and when the public<br>  mind has taken the stand, to which it seems rapidly advancing, that children<br>  and youth must understand what they read and what they learn, then at least<br>  the works of Mr. Angell will receive that patronage, which they so eminently<br>  deserve. This testimony in favor of that gentleman is designed not as a mere<br>  puff; but as a just tribute of praise to one who has labored long and<br>  faithfully for the public good. ROSWELL C.

    "transcription": "<p>  <em>Canterbury decency exemplified.</em>  —It may not be known to many of our readers that the Junior editor of this<br>  paper (W.H. Burleigh) has, for several weeks past, been engaged as an<br>  instructor in Miss Crandall’s school. Such, however, is the fact. We did not<br>  pause to enquire whether the<br>  <em>benevolent</em>  and<br>  <em>christian</em>  people of Canterbury would be pleased or displeased with it—or what other<br>  people might say or think about it—the conviction that we could<br>  be&nbsp; useful—that we could by our influence, limited though it be, and by<br>  our example and by our labors&nbsp; assist in the moral and intellectual<br>  elevation of a race long and grievously oppressed, was sufficient to<br>  induce us to take the step we have taken. We knew the shameful persecutions<br>  which Miss Crandall had endured, and were ready to expect that we also might<br>  receive a share of obloquy. We are willing to receive the censure of a certain<br>  class. The hate of the bad is the highest commendation a good man can receive.<br></p><p>  On Tuesday evening last, as we were returning after the labors of the<br>  day, to our lodgings about a quarter of a mile south of the village, we were<br>  saluted, when opposite the house of an opposer of the school, by a volley of<br>  addled eggs. They poured in upon us like grape shot from a seventy-four—but<br>  luckily no one hit us. The miscreants who made the assault were concealed,<br>  like cowards, behind the wall, and owing to this and the dimness of the night,<br>  we were unable to discern any one. We quickened our pace, and was soon beyond<br>  the reach of the&nbsp; missiles. As we passed the barn of the individual above<br>  referred to, however, we perceived that the great door fronting&nbsp; the<br>  street was wide open, and we made up our mind to receive another volley from<br>  the garrison which we had reason to suspect was within. Nor were we<br>  disappointed. Canterbury arguments, in the shape of addled eggs, again poured<br>  in upon us; but we passed rapidly on, and were soon beyond their reach. We<br>  know not how it happened, but for some reason we escaped untouched, though<br>  many were thrown and some struck very near us.<br></p><p>  We have a few remarks to make upon this shameful and unprovoked attack. To say<br>  it is in perfect keeping with the past course of Canterburians is to say<br>  nothing new. When fathers offer to help tear down the house, and assert that<br>  they had rather their children should go to hell, than to go to school to Miss<br>  C. in case she should ever take a white school again—when fathers conspire<br>  together to starve the school out, and reckless miscreants are thus encouraged<br>  to attempt to burn it out—when fathers look with complacency, nay,<br>  with delight upon the depredations already made on Miss C’s property—it<br>  is not to be wondered at that their children, previously depraved as they are,<br>  should venture in the darkness of the night to attack an unarmed individual<br>  who was known not only to<br>  <em>favor</em>  Miss C’s project, but to<br>  <em>assist</em>  her in the accomplishment of her designs. We are not disappointed. Addled eggs<br>  are fit instruments for such people—and such people, when engaged in robbing<br>  their neighbor’s hen-roosts to obtain them, and afterwards skulking behind<br>  the walls and in the barns to throw them at the passer by, are<br>  engaged in an avocation for which their capacities seem to be peculiarly<br>  adapted. We envy them not the distinction which they will inevitably acquire.<br>  But it would become the parents of such promising youths, if, instead of<br>  casting impediments in the way of the instruction of others, they would<br>  instruct their own children in good morals and good manners, and if they<br>  cannot render them<br>  <em>useful,</em>  at least render them<br>  <em>decent</em>  . A portion of their leisure time devoted to the laudable object of checking<br>  the precocious depravity of their offspring, may save them the future<br>  anguish of witnessing that offspring dangling from the gallows. We hope our<br>  advice will be taken kindly by Canterbury people.<br></p><p>  This article is intended for those only whom it fits. No others will<br>  understand us as meaning them. We cannot forbear adding, however, as a quieter<br>  to the vague fears of the parents of Canterbury, that there can be no danger<br>  of their sons ever marrying any of the colored girls of Miss C’s school<br>  even if they were so inclined. They must become far more refined, in<br>  mind and in manners, before they would be able to come in competition<br>  with the most ignorant and least refined scholar in school.<br></p>",

The address was ably reviewed, at<br>  the time, in the columns of the Brooklyn Unionist, by its intelligent editor,<br>  Mr. Burleigh, who challenged the heathenish doctor to a public discussion.—ED.<br>  LIB.”]<br></p><p>  It is well known that<br>  <em>equality</em>  in every respect, between our white and black population, is a prominent<br>  feature in the abolition creed. For a time, but very few of the abolitionists<br>  themselves, were willing to advocate this doctrine in public, but they do not<br>  hesitate to do it now, on all occasions. If, therefore, any member of that<br>  association is disposed to answer this extract in a<br>  <em>direct</em>  and<br>  <em>explicit</em>  manner, he shall have an opportunity to do so in the columns of this paper.<br></p><p>[actual speech follows]</p><p>  But, says the abolitionist, this country is the black man’s home as much as it<br>  is yours, and you have no right to drive him from it. Granted. But is it<br>  inconsistent with benevolence to wish to better his condition by removing him?<br>  Still it is replied, our duty requires us to make this country a pleasant home<br>  to him, by removing the civil and social disabilities which now make him what<br>  he is, a poor degraded being.<br></p><p>  Let us examine this point a little. The negro, in the present state of<br>  society, is denied several political privileges. He is deprived of the right<br>  of suffrage. He is excluded from all offices of honor and profit. He is<br>  prohibited by public sentiment from practicing in the&nbsp; several<br>  professions. He is virtually shut out from many other employments, by which<br>  his white neighbor earns distinction and wealth. Now, let the law do what it<br>  can for him—let every political disability be removed,—‘tis a<br>  consummation&nbsp; devoutly to be wished—establish institutions for his moral<br>  and intellectual cultivation, and what then? The outworks are indeed forced,<br>  but the citadel remains yet impregnable. He is<br>  <em>black,</em>  and this single circumstance, I am bold to say,<br>  <em>    will always be a barrier between him and the white, which he cannot<br>    overleap.<br>  </em>  Educated and accomplished he may be, and protected by the whole power of the<br>  civil arm, still he<br>  <em>    is forever condemned to occupy the lowest point in the scale of social life.<br>    No form of philanthropy,<br>  </em>  no legal enactment can prevent this. There is an imperium in imperio, an<br>  empire of sentiment and fashion and opinion, an authority of nature and<br>  instinct, altogether paramount to all written law, and beyond its control. The<br>  negro, if he be allowed to vote by your side, must act with you as your equal<br>  every where else. You must meet him with a bright smile of joyous<br>  congratulation. You must extend to him all the tender charities and courtesies<br>  of social life. You must give him a seat at your table, a welcome to your<br>  fireside and to your parlor, a place beside you in your bed. You must<br>  reciprocate with him all the elegances and refinements of polished society. He<br>  must be your companion and confidential friend by day and by night, by the way<br>  side and in the field, in the drawing&nbsp; room of the affluent, as well as<br>  in the hut of the indigent. He must be&nbsp; allowed to break to you the bread<br>  of life—to prescribe to you&nbsp; in sickness, and decide in courts of justice<br>  and halls of legislation, important questions pertaining to your life, liberty<br>  and property. In all these things, there must be no constraint, but you must<br>  bind him to your heart of hearts, and most freely and unaffectedly, share with<br>  him in the delicate sympathies and fond endearments of domestic life. If<br>  fortune smiles upon him and frowns upon you, you must be content to sit at his<br>  feet and serve him. Unless you go to this full extent, you degrade him. Admit<br>  him to a moiety of these privileges, and he will but more keenly feel the loss<br>  of the remainder. The higher he goes, the more will his avidity increase, to<br>  reach the summit. Keep back a single social or civil right pertaining to<br>  entire equality, and that Mordecai in the gate will embitter all his joys, and<br>  render unavailable the blushing honors he bears so thick upon him. Such is<br>  human nature.<br></p><p>  Now, fellow citizens, need I ask, if it be possible to elevate the black man<br>  to an equality with the white? If it be, I give up the argument at once. If<br>  the negro can be treated in this country as it becometh a man, in whose face<br>  is lighted up the quenchless fire of an undying intellect, and on whose brow<br>  God has stamped the indelible signet of immortality, the colonization society,<br>  as far as respects the American negro, is laboring in a worthless cause.<br>  <em>    Take the negro home to your heart, and embrace him as your brother, and you<br>    will save our society much time and expense.<br>  </em></p><p>  Can this be done? I appeal to you not as inhabitants of Heaven or of Paradise,<br>  not as angels or glorified saints, but as imperfect men and women, tenants of<br>  this nether sphere, in which bitter is mingled with the sweet, and thorns<br>  encircle every rose. Are you willing to go all this length in relation to the<br>  black man? Can you so far conquer your antipathies as to make him your equal<br>  in the true intent and meaning of this term? ABOLITIONISTS, CAN YOU?<br></p><p>  History furnishes no instances of two distinct races of men, holding no<br>  connection by blood with each other, living together on terms of perfect<br>  equality. Turn its pages over and look through the long and gloomy annals of<br>  the past, and you cannot find a single fact of the kind. In order to equality,<br>  there must be<br>  <em>amalgamation</em>  or<br>  <em>separation.</em>  When Rome was inundated by a deluge of barbarians, the aboriginals of the<br>  country were not exterminated, but Hun, Goth, Vandal, and Roman united<br>  together, and gradually blended into the modern Italians. When Britain was<br>  overrun by a successive tide of Danes, Saxons, and Normans, the ancient<br>  inhabitants were in part driven into Wales, and in still larger proportions,<br>  became incorporated with their invaders. All past experience is opposed to the<br>  abolition doctrine of ‘prejudice vincible’ without amalgamation.<br></p><p>  Fellow citizens, take your stand. Look at the ultimate results of the<br>  immediate emancipation scheme, and let the overflowings of your benevolence be<br>  directed to a union of the two races by ties of consanguinity, or to a<br>  separation between them. If the one be revolting to reason and nature, and the<br>  other be deemed impossible, then sit down content under a state of things<br>  melancholy indeed, but remediless and desperate.<br></p>",

    "transcription": "<p>  “Some two or three&nbsp; weeks since we published, upon authority so<br>  respectable as to have been considered altogether unquestionable, an account<br>  of the unwelcome reception of the Rev. Captain Stuart, of Great Britain, in<br>  the town of Plainfield, Conn., together with a statement as to his rather<br>  forcible expulsion from that place. It appears that the account received by us<br>  was not altogether correct; but wherein it was incorrect, we have not been<br>  able exactly to ascertain. But for the style of rudeness with which we have<br>  been assailed upon&nbsp; this subject, we should have noted the inaccuracy of<br>  the account communicated to us before, although we had not the means of<br>  correcting it. All the papers contradicting our version of&nbsp; the affair,<br>  have admitted that disturbances did&nbsp; attend Captain Stuart’s visit to<br>  Plainfield, but have not informed us&nbsp; as to particulars. The<br>  <em>Emancipator</em>  of yesterday, commences an article this:—<br></p><p>  “THE AFFAIR AT PLAINFIELD.—Our readers probably know that during the height of<br>  the late reign of terror in New York, the Editor of the N.Y. Commercial<br>  Advertiser, “more the organ of the&nbsp; Colonization Society than any other<br>  in this city,” endeavored to keep himself and his mob in countenance by a<br>  ludicrous and apparently approving account of a mob said to have taken place<br>  in Plainfield, Conn., in which the farmers of that place were described as<br>  literally driving Charles Stuart out of town with their cart whips.<br>  <em>The story was not true.</em>  —But it was true that some unmannerly boys attempted, without success, to<br>  disturb the lecture. The following is extracted from an&nbsp; account given in<br>  the Brooklyn (Ct.) Unionist:<br></p><p>  “We have called them<br>  <em>gentlemen,</em>  though had they been strangers to us, had we not been personally acquainted<br>  with them, known their high pretensions, the respectability of their<br>  parentage, their advantages for learning what belongs to the character of a<br>  gentleman, and that on many occasions&nbsp; they show that they<br>  <em>do</em>  know how to conduct with propriety, there is much reason to&nbsp; fear that<br>  their disorderly behaviour, their indecency and rudeness of language and<br>  action, would have led us to rank them with the lowest vulgar. As it is,<br>  however, the graduate of Yale, the undergraduate of another college, the<br>  students in the academy, the sons of wealthy and respectable citizens of<br>  Plainfield, of church members and zealous colonizationists,<br>  <em>    (for the parents of every Plainfield youth whom we {noted?] in the rabble,<br>    are decided ‘Colonizationists’) must, we suppose, be called gentlemen, be<br>    their conduct what it may.—<br>  </em>  Much good may the name do them, and may they yet learn to deserve it, though<br>  we fear ‘twill be a hard lesson for some of them, [undecipherable] any truth<br>  in the maxims of moralists respecting the [undecipherable]<br></p><p>  [undecipherable] than one exception, we<br>  <em>know,</em>  and we think [undecipherable]{end of Unionist quote and, by implication, of<br>  Emancipator quote}<br></p><p>  Now in the first place, the introductory&nbsp; remarks of the Emancipator are<br>  not true. Our account of the Plainfield disturbance<br>  <em>was not</em>  published “during the height of the late reign of terror,” but when all was<br>  tranquil in the week following [my note – it was published July 15<sup>th</sup>  – notes in main PC file];—and in the second place, the account of the Brooklyn<br>  Unionist, (an&nbsp; abolition paper published in the neighborhood of<br>  Plainfield,) represents the case, if anything, more unfavorably than we<br>  did.—Indeed our mistake seems to have consisted only in stating that the young<br>  men cracked their whips while Mr. Stuart was forcibly placed in his waggon<br>  (sic). Upon this point, then, we stand corrected.<br></p><p>  But a communication under the signature of Captain Stuart himself, which<br>  appears in the Emancipator, with the prefatory remark that it “was refused<br>  publication in the Commercial Advertiser,” calls for a few observations. It<br>  was not because he attempted to correct an error into which it is<br>  [indecipherable] fallen, that we objected to the publication of his<br>  article—for that we would very cheerfully [indecipherable] done at any time.<br>  Our objection arose not only from the inflammatory character of the<br>  communication, as a while, but from a more weighty consideration still. We<br>  entirely object to the visit of Captain Stuart among us, as being not only<br>  uncalled for, but highly improper; and it would be the highth of imprudence<br>  for him, again to appear before the public, on the subject of his mission,<br>  either in print, in the pulpit, or at the forum. He seems to be an amiable,<br>  and we doubt not a good man; but he has no business in this country on such<br>  an&nbsp; errand. How, for instance, would it be received for an American to<br>  repair to England, for the purpose of delivering lectures in favor repealing<br>  the Act of Union between England and Ireland! Such interference in the<br>  internal affairs of another nation, would not be permitted, and any<br>  <em>foreign agent</em>  attempting it, would very properly be prevented from opening his lips. The<br>  principle, it will be seen, is precisely the same.<br></p><p>  But Mr. Stuart, it appears, is not long to be the only agent from abroad,<br>  engaged in the work of enlightening our country on the subject of its<br>  own&nbsp; domestic and social relations. He is soon to be joined by a Mr.<br>  Thompson, who is understood to be on his way hither&nbsp; as a Missionary from<br>  some excellent ladies of Glasgow. Mr. Thompson is said to be an able and an<br>  eloquent man; but we trust that on his arrival amongst us, he will perceive<br>  the propriety of withholding any displays, either of his talents or his<br>  rhetoric, on the subject of his mission.—Indeed—and we say it deliberately,<br>  though with all kindness—we hold that neither Mr. Stuart, nor Mr. Thompson,<br>  nor any other strangers from abroad, should be permitted to convoke and<br>  harangue an American assembly upon this question. We doubt not the goodness of<br>  their intentions; but they are laboring under a sad mistake, as to the path of<br>  duty. If they have feelings of kindness for the slaves of this country, let<br>  them remain in their own; or else, if they choose, let them imitate a King and<br>  a Van Rensselaer, and go among the slaves to preach the Gospel in a manner<br>  compatible with the laws and usages of those States. The truth is, these<br>  excellent, though misjudging, philanthropists, do not understand the real nad<br>  inherent difficulties of the case, arising from the&nbsp; essential difference<br>  in the structures of our respective governments. The British Constitution is<br>  unwritten, consisting, in fact, of the common law of the realm. Parliament is<br>  omnipotent; and it had a perfect right, politically speaking, to abolish the<br>  slavery of its colonies at a blow, if it chose to do so.—Nor—residing as they<br>  do at a distance of four thousand miles from the colonies—could they<br>  understand of appreciate the difficulties, and the long train of evils, that<br>  must inevitably follow in the train of hasty and rash legislation, upon a<br>  question at once so important and so delicate.<br></p><p>  But it is not so in the United States. We live under a written Constitution,<br>  conferring certain powers upon the general government, and specifically<br>  withholding others; and among the powers thus reserved, is that of interfering<br>  with the domestic relations of the several States. So that although&nbsp; the<br>  general government is paramount in some respects, neither it, nor the state<br>  governments, nor the people of the free states, have any more right to<br>  interfere with the slave question, than they have to interfere with the<br>  nobility and the serfs of Russia, or the manufacturers and their operatives in<br>  England, or on the question of repealing the Irish Union. The truth—and every<br>  day’s experience more thoroughly convinces us of the fact—that the slave<br>  question must be left with&nbsp; the state governments, and the people where<br>  the evil exists. They understand the subject better than we do; they best know<br>  how to mitigate its rigors; and, ultimately, to apply the means of cure.<br>  Meantime let the efforts of American Christians and philanthropists be<br>  directed in the best and most efficient, and yet legal and inoffensive manner,<br>  to the moral and social improvement of the slave population, with a view to<br>  their gradual and ultimate emancipation. Depend upon it, the true method of<br>  improving the conditions of the slaves, and preparing them for that freedom<br>  which they must one day be put in possession of, is to pursue a kind and<br>  conciliatory course towards their masters. To abuse and exasperate them, can<br>  have only the&nbsp; follow effect, viz: that of binding the fetters of the<br>  slave more strongly—excluding information from him more rigidly—and<br>  protracting the period of his servitude indefinitely.<br></p><p>  With these views we deprecate all improper interference upon the subject. It<br>  regard to Messrs. Stuart and Thompson, we would treat them with all possible<br>  hospitality and kindness. We could not allow a finger to be&nbsp; raised<br>  against them, nor a hair of their heads to be injured.—But they&nbsp; should<br>  neither of them be allowed again to make any public show in&nbsp; any town,<br>  city, or village, north of the State of Delaware, upon this subject. We desire<br>  that it may be perfectly understood, wherever these foreign agents may present<br>  themselves to agitate the slave question, that they shall not be&nbsp; heard.<br>  They have no business here upon such a mission. And measures at once the most<br>  peaceable and effectual, should be adopted to prevent them from scattering<br>  fire-brands, arrows and death amongst us.<br></p>",

We feel the deepest shame that such<br>  violations of the public peace, and of the rights of citizens, should be&nbsp;<br>  perpetrated in our country, in this age of the world. But as they have<br>  transpired, we are bound to publish them—and to attribute&nbsp; these wicked<br>  works to their real authors. Who are they? Who are the incendiaries? Not<br>  surely the combustible materials which have been inflamed; but those<br>  unprincipled men who have inflamed them. Not the mob—but the men who have<br>  gathered, excited, and directed the mob. We say without hesitation, that James<br>  Watson Webb and Col. Stone should be held pre-eminently responsible for the<br>  late notorious proceedings in the city of New York. Their papers, ‘the Courier<br>  and Enquirer,’ and the ‘Commercial Advertiser,’ have been, for more than a<br>  year past, industriously circulating (through a larger portion of the<br>  community, than any other paper could,) the grossest misrepresentations of the<br>  sentiments and purposes of the Abolitionists. They have done all in their<br>  power to awaken the hatred, and&nbsp; direct the blind zeal of the ignorant,<br>  reckless, and unprincipled against a portion of their fellow citizens, whose<br>  only offence is, that they are pleading the cause of bleeding humanity—ay, the<br>  cause of millions of Americans, who are held in abject bondage, or paralyzing<br>  degradation. Paragraphs have repeatedly appeared in their papers, which more<br>  than intimated that any measures should be resorted to, for the suppression of<br>  the Abolitionists. It was owing to the exertions of the ‘Courier and Enquirer’<br>  and the ‘Commercial Advertiser,’ that the disgraceful proceedings took place<br>  there last fall, intended to prevent the formation of the New-York<br>  Anti-Slavery Society. And we may fairly attribute to them, more perhaps than<br>  to any other agents of the pro slavery party, the succession of riots that<br>  have recently occurred. —The style, in which Messrs. Webb and Stone have<br>  remarked upon these transactions, (more than half excusing) is&nbsp; adapted,<br>  if it be not designed, to urge on the populace to further outrage.<br></p><p>  &nbsp; &nbsp;Now we would ask the intelligent and candid, what does this<br>  procedure of the pro slavery party prove? What, but that they are conscious<br>  they cannot meet the opposers of American oppression and cruelty, in fair<br>  discussion!—If they could disprove our statements, refute our arguments, or<br>  turn the point of our appeal, are they indeed such men, that they would still,<br>  of choice, resort to the base means they have been using? We are unwilling to<br>  think they are so bad. Is it not rather because they foresee that moral means<br>  can never effect their purposes, that they resort to brute force?&nbsp; We<br>  think so. Let the intelligent and candid judge.—<br>  <em>Brooklyn Unionist.</em></p><p align=\"center\"></p>",

This paper was<br>started as Miss Crandall’s negro vehicle, and was called the Unionist. This<br>female philanthropist, by her masculine zeal in the negro cause, has finally<br>obtained the hand of a Mr. Phileo.—Her zeal has now come to a “crisis,” her<br>house in Canterbury, lately occupied as a “School for colored Misses,” is<br>offered for sale, and the school is given up, all because the inhabitants stoned<br>the house in the night season, and endangered the lives of the “teachers and<br>colored Misses.” We suppose Mr. Calvin Phileo and his wife Prudence will now<br>retire to some favored retreat, and raise little Phileo’s. But the Unionist<br>turns Windham County Whig as Mrs. Prudence turns from her school. The Unionist<br>has also a small touch of the Anti Mason, and is urging the Antis to come into<br>the support of Trumbull, Jackson &amp; Co. It is curious to see the odd ends of<br>all parties, disappointed politicians, zealots in negroism, Indianism,<br>Mormonism, and every other mad project, finally fall in with the federal<br>party—there to swell occasionally, and fall still lower with the old carcase<br>[sic], while it is undergoing its long process of decomposition.

The acts of our last legislature are a sufficient index of the character of that party which has obtained, for a brief space we hope, the ascendancy in this State. We cannot, for a moment, believe that a majority of the people of Connecticut, approve <em>all</em> the recent enactments of our Legislature, but such has been and is still the course pursued by the only press existing in this county, that many of the people are probably unapprised of the spirit and tendency of their proceedings. It is too evident to be denied, that the Advertiser is so devoted to the policy of a party, and the aggrandizement of a few party leaders, that a fair discussion of the pretensions and measures of our prominent men, cannot find admission to its columns. Hence the necessity of another organ of communication to the public, on the great interests of the state and nation, which has brought the Unionist before the public.</p> <p>This paper will be pledged to no party, but will canvass the claims of all aspirants to the public favor, and all measures of public policy, on their own merits. On all the great questions upon which the mind of the community is divided, a free admission will be given to well and candidly written articles on both sides, if offered, but every thing of a scurrilous or abusive character will be excluded, come from what source it may.</p> <p>The Unionist will be the advocate of temperance, virtue and sound morality, and will pursue that course which a deep conviction of the truth of the sentiment contained in its motto points out. It will also contain items of general intelligence, literary selections and the usual variety of miscellaneous matter, and no effort will be spared on the part of the editor to make it worthy of the public favor. How far his efforts will succeed, the future course of the paper will determine.</p> <br><p>TERMS. - -Mail subscribers, $2, in advance. Delivered by stage, or post, one dollar and seventy-five cents.

The same account mentions that a physician, having been called to one of the pupils, in a case of emergency, gave notion that, in obedience to public sentiment, he should be obliged to decline any future call of the kind. We are inclined to think this latter item an accidental repetition of a circumstance, which, we believe, occurred some time past. We forget whether, or no, our readers were informed of it; or of the kindred circumstance that a poor washer-woman, though desirous of washing clothes for Miss Crandall’s family, was obliged to yield to the public sentiment of the village, which was outraged at so enormous a crime. As to pulling down the house, though we doubt not the existence of sufficient malice and tyranny on the part of a <em>few</em>, to be <em>gratified</em> with almost any outrage, we have no idea that any thing of the kind will be seriously attempted.
