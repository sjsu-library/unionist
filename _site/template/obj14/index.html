    <em>“Carrying the war into Egypt,”</em>—We had supposed that the crusade which the good people of Canterbury, Ct have for some time past waged against the school of <em>Miss Crandall,</em> would have been suffered to drop when the whole force of legal proceedings had been spent upon them, and the lady herself became one of the band of “reputably married ladies.” But we find by advertisements in the last Brooklyn Unionist, that her neighbors were not as charitably and forgivingly disposed as ourself. Mr. Calvin Phileo, the husband of Miss C. advertises in the paper above named, that during the night of the ninth instant his house was assaulted by a number of persons armed with heavy clubs and iron bars, who destroyed five window sashes and about one hundred panes of glass, and the family greatly alarmed, though it does not appear any of them were injured. Mr. Phileo and lady have consequently determined to quit that ‘heathenish neighborhood,’ and offer their house and appurtenances for sale, and a reward of fifty dollars for such information as may lead to the detection of their assailants. The reputation of the city of Canterbury will (if it has not already) suffer more in the estimation of the dispassionate and unprejudiced in all parts of the Union, than have the parties and principles against whom they have kept up such an exterminating war, if the institution is not allowed to be dissolved without further violence, and its inmates permitted to ‘depart in peace.’” This article was copied from a New York paper, here abbreviated to <em>NY Man. </em>Maybe <em>Map.?</em>
