    <p align="center">  SIXTH REPORT OF THE AMERICAN  <strong>TEMPERANCE SOCIETY</strong>  ,</p><p align="center"><em>Continued</em></p><p>  IV. Laws which authorize the licensing of men to traffic in ardent spirit,  violate the first principles of political economy, and are highly injurious to  the wealth of a nation.</p><p>  The wealth of a nation consists of the wealth of all the individuals that  compose it. The sources of wealth are labor, land, and capital. The last is  indeed the product of the two former; but as it may be used to increase their  value, it is considered by writers on political economy, as one of the  original sources of national wealth. Whatever lessons either of these, or  their productiveness when employed upon each other, lessens the wealth of the  country. Capital may be employed in two ways; either to produce new capital,  or merely to afford gratification, and in the production of that gratification  he consumed, without repealing its value. The first may be called capital, and  the last expenditure. These will of course bear inverse proportions to each  other. If the first be large, the last must be small, and vice versa. Without  any change of the amount of wealth, capital will be increased by the lessened  by the increase of expenditure. Although the manner of dividing makes no  difference with the present amount of national wealth, it makes great  difference with the future amount; as it alters materially the sources of  producing it, the means of an equal, or increased reproduction.</p><p>  For instance, a man fond of noise and excited agreeably by the hearing of it,  pays a dollar for gunpowder, and touches fire to it. He occasions an entire  loss of that amount of property. Although the powder maker and the merchant,  may both have received their pay, if it has not benefitted the man, to him it  has been a total loss; and if the sale of it was more profitable than would  have been the sale of some useful article, it has been an entire loss to the  community. And if by the explosion the man is burnt, partially loses his  reason, is taken off a time from business, and confined by sickness to his  bed, must have nurses, physicians, &amp;c. the loss is still increased. And if  he never recovers fully his health, or reason, suffers his social affections  and moral sensibility, becomes less faithful in the education of his children,  and they are more exposed to temptation and ruin, and he is never again as  able or willing to be habitually employed in productive labor, the nation  loses equal to the amount of all these put together. And if his example leads  other men to spend, and to suffer in the same way, the loss is still farther  increased; and so on, through all its effects.</p><p>  And even though the powder maker and the merchant have made enormous profit,  this does not prevent the loss to the community; any more than the profit of  lottery gamblers, or counterfeiters of the public coin, prevents loss to the  community. Nor does it meet the case, to say that the property changes hands.  This is not true. The man who sold the powder made a profit of only a part  even of the money which the other man paid for it; while he lost not only the  whole, but vastly more. The whole of the original cost was only a small part  of the loss to the buyer, and for the nation. The merchant gained nothing of  the time, and other numerous expenses, which the buyer lost; nor does he in  any way remunerate the community for that loss.</p><p>  Suppose that man, instead of buying the powder, had bought a pair of shoes;  and that the tanner and the shoemaker had gained in this case, what the  powder-maker and the merchant gained in the other; and that by the use of the  shoes, though they were finally worn out, the man gained twice as much as he  gave for them; without any loss of health, or reason, social affection, or  moral susceptibility; and without any of the consequent evils.â€”Who cannot see  that it would have increased his wealth, and that of the nation, without  injury to any, and have promoted the benefit of all.</p><p>  This illustrates the principle with regard to ardent spirit. A man buys a  quantity of it, and drinks it; when he would be, as the case with every man,  in all respects better without it. It is to him an entire loss. The merchant  may have made a profit of one quarter of the cost, but the buyer loses the  whole; and he loses the time employed in obtaining and drinking it. He loses,  also, and the community loses, equal to all its deteriorating effects upon his  body and mind, his children, and all who come under his influence. His land  becomes less productive. The capital of course produced by this land and labor  is diminished; and thus the means are diminished of future reproduction. And  by the increase of expenditure in proportion to the capital, it is still  farther diminished, till to meet the increasingly disproportionate expenses,  the whole is often taken, and the means of future reproduction are entirely  exhausted. And if there is no seed to sow, there is of course no future  harvest. This is but a simple history of what is taking in thousands of cases  continually; and of what is the tendency of the traffic in ardent spirit from  beginning to end. It lessens the productiveness of land and labor, and of  course diminishes the amount of capital; while in proportion, it increases the  expenditure, and thus in both ways is constantly exhausting the means of  future production. And this is its tendency, in all its bearing, in proportion  to the quantity used, from the man who takes only his glass, to the man who  takes his quart a day. It is a palpable and gross violation of all correct  principles of political economy; and from beginning to end, tends to diminish  all the sources of national wealth.</p>
