Mr Hatch, on the 6  <sup>th</sup>  ballot.</p><p>  The Senate then proceeded to the order of the day, and resumed the  consideration of Mr Sprague’s resolution to alter the mode of electing their  Standing Committees by the Senate, instead of being as formerly appointed by  the President  <em>pro tem.</em></p><p align="center">HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES</p><p align="right">TUESDAY, December 10.</p><p>  On motion of Mr McDuffie, the Report of the Secretary on the removal of the  deposites [sic], was taken up and referred to the Committee of the Whole on  the state of the Union.</p><p>  Mr Pinckney, of South Carolina, rose and stated that he held in his hand  certain resolutions which he would respectfully ask leave to offer for  adoption by the House. He believed that it had always been customary for the  House to adopt suitable tributes of respect to its deceased members. The S.C.  delegation had heard, with deep regret, of the death of their colleague, the  Hon. Thomas D. Singleton, and it was his painful duty to communicate that  mournful information to the House. He died at Raleigh, whilst on his journey  to the Capitol, whither he was hastening to assume his seat, and to discharge  his duties, as a member of this body. ****</p><p>  With these few remarks, which he had felt it his duty to submit, in justice t  the character of one whose memory deserved a far better tribute than any he  could offer, he now proposed the following resolutions for the consideration  of the House;</p><p>  Resolved, That we have received, with deep regret, the melancholy intelligence  of the death of the Hon. THO’S D. SINGLETON, a Representative elect from the  State of South Carolina.</p><p>  Resolved, That this House tender the expression of their sympathy to the  relatives of the deceased, upon this mournful event; and that, in testimony of  their regret for the loss, and respect for his memory, the members will wear  crape upon the left arm for thirty days.</p><p>The House then adjourned.</p><p>IN SENATE</p><p>THURSDAY, December 12.</p><p>  A Message from the President was received by the hands of Mr Donalson [blurry  copy, not sure if correct], his Private Secretary, which was read as follows:</p><p>  I have attentively considered the resolution of the Senate of the 11th  instant, requesting the President of the United States to communicate to the  Senate "a copy of the paper which has been published, and which purports to  have been read by him to the heads of the Executive Departments, dated the  18th day of September last, relating to the removal of the deposits of the  public money from the Bank of the United States and its offices."  <br />  The executive is a co-ordinate and independent branch of the Government  equally with the Senate, and I have yet to learn under what constitutional  authority that branch of the Legislature has a right to require of me an  account of any communication, either verbally or in writing, made to the heads  of Departments acting as a Cabinet council. As well might I be required to  detail to the Senate the free and private conversations I have held with those  officers on any subject relating to their duties and my own.  <br />  Feeling my responsibility to the American people, I am willing upon all  occasions to explain to them the grounds of my conduct, and I am willing upon  all proper occasions to give to either branch of the Legislature any  information in my possession that can be useful in the execution of the  appropriate duties confided to them.  <br />  Knowing the constitutional rights of the Senate, I shall be the last man under  any circumstances to interfere with them. Knowing those of the Executive, I  shall at all times endeavor to maintain them agreeably to the provisions of  the Constitution and the solemn oath I have taken to support and defend it.  <br />  I am constrained, therefore, by a proper sense of my own self-respect and of  the rights secured by the Constitution to the executive branch of the  Government to decline a compliance with your request. ANDREW JACKSON</p><p>After the message had been read,</p><p>  Mr Clay said, that a call had been made on the President for a copy of a  document which has been published and extensively circulated by the papers in  this city—a document intimately connected with the safety of the treasure of  the country. The call for it was made under the ull conviction that the Senate  ought to have that document. It had been refused, under the pretext that the  rights of the Chief Magistrate were invaded by it. He always would be disposed  to respect the rights of every public officer, but the President could have no  more confidence in his rights, then I feel in the rights of the Senate. The  right o the Senate to call for this paper was founded on the ground that the  whole world was already in possession of it. It was made because the document  was sent forth to the American people upon an all-important subject, and  because it was the right of the Senate to have it. Nor was it made because the  call was in violation of precedent or an established usage. But the President  has refused to give us this document, and it was not necessary to proceed  further in the pursuit. One result happens from it. The President don’t deny  the genuineness o the paper. It is before the world, and as we have endeavored  to get it, and it has been refused, I have a right to take the next best  evidence of the document, and that is as it has been published in the official  paper. In every instance, therefore, where I have occasion to use it, I shall  avail myself of that publication of it, as genuine.</p><p>  Mr Grundy said he thought when the proposition was made, that it was a very  unnecessary procedure.</p><p>  Here the presiding office interposed that the debate was out of order unless  some motion was intended to be made.</p><p>  Mr Grundy said he intended to love, before he concluded, that the message be  laid on the table; and then resumed—</p><p>  That he thought it unnecessary, because we only wanted evidence when facts had  not come to our knowledge, or when they are denied.—Now, he believed that both  friends and enemies admitted this document to be genuine—to be what it  purported to be. He therefore had thought that nothing beneficial could result  from this proposition, and this was what induced him to vote against it. The  President has given his objection to complying with the call, and what is it?  Why, that the Senate has asked for a private communication from the Chief  Magistrate to his Cabinet. He, [Mr. G.} would never question the propriety of  the motives of the Senator who wanted this information. But the President has.  <em>Note: Clay was a former nominee for the office of the President</em></p><p align="center">IN SENATE.</p><p align="right">WEDNESDAY, December 11, 1833.</p><p>  Mr Bibb, pursuant to notice given, presented certain joint resolutions  providing or an alteration in the Constitution of the United States, in  relation to the mode of electing the President, and Vice President, and then  moved to lay the same on the table and print them. Mr. B. said he felt no  disposition to press the consideration of the resolutions now, and therefore  moved that the second Monday in January next be assigned for taking them up,  and also the resolutions offered by Mr. Benton somedays since, on the same  subject, at the same time; which was agreed to.</p><p>  Mr Clay moved the consideration of Mr Benton’s resolution, relative to the  amount of moneys in deposite [sic] at particular periods in the Bank of the  United States.</p><p><em>Apparently a line is missing here</em></p><p>  Said that it is a matter which you have no regiht to interrogate him about;  and his opinion is, too, that to comply with the request would be setting a  dangerous precedent. He [Mr G.] was not inclined to sat any thing on the  subject of the removal of the deposits, when that matter should come up for  consideration. But if he did, he could not, even if he were so disposed, speak  of that paper as any other than a genuine one, or deny its authenticity. He  therefore moved to key the message on the table; which was agreed to.</p><p align="center">HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</p><p align="right">Friday, Dec, 13, 1833</p><p>  The Speaker presented to the House a memorial from Messrs. Gilpin, McElderry,  and Wager, the three Government Directors of the Bank of the United State, in  relation to the conduct of the Directors, and especially of the President of  that institution.</p>

He died at Raleigh, whilst on his journey  to the Capitol, whither he was hastening to assume his seat, and to discharge  his duties, as a member of this body. ****</p><p>  With these few remarks, which he had felt it his duty to submit, in justice t  the character of one whose memory deserved a far better tribute than any he  could offer, he now proposed the following resolutions for the consideration  of the House;</p><p>  Resolved, That we have received, with deep regret, the melancholy intelligence  of the death of the Hon. THO’S D. SINGLETON, a Representative elect from the  State of South Carolina.</p><p>  Resolved, That this House tender the expression of their sympathy to the  relatives of the deceased, upon this mournful event; and that, in testimony of  their regret for the loss, and respect for his memory, the members will wear  crape upon the left arm for thirty days.</p><p>The House then adjourned.</p><p>IN SENATE</p><p>THURSDAY, December 12.</p><p>  A Message from the President was received by the hands of Mr Donalson [blurry  copy, not sure if correct], his Private Secretary, which was read as follows:</p><p>  I have attentively considered the resolution of the Senate of the 11th  instant, requesting the President of the United States to communicate to the  Senate "a copy of the paper which has been published, and which purports to  have been read by him to the heads of the Executive Departments, dated the  18th day of September last, relating to the removal of the deposits of the  public money from the Bank of the United States and its offices."  <br />  The executive is a co-ordinate and independent branch of the Government  equally with the Senate, and I have yet to learn under what constitutional  authority that branch of the Legislature has a right to require of me an  account of any communication, either verbally or in writing, made to the heads  of Departments acting as a Cabinet council. As well might I be required to  detail to the Senate the free and private conversations I have held with those  officers on any subject relating to their duties and my own.  <br />  Feeling my responsibility to the American people, I am willing upon all  occasions to explain to them the grounds of my conduct, and I am willing upon  all proper occasions to give to either branch of the Legislature any  information in my possession that can be useful in the execution of the  appropriate duties confided to them.  <br />  Knowing the constitutional rights of the Senate, I shall be the last man under  any circumstances to interfere with them. Knowing those of the Executive, I  shall at all times endeavor to maintain them agreeably to the provisions of  the Constitution and the solemn oath I have taken to support and defend it.  <br />  I am constrained, therefore, by a proper sense of my own self-respect and of  the rights secured by the Constitution to the executive branch of the  Government to decline a compliance with your request. ANDREW JACKSON</p><p>After the message had been read,</p><p>  Mr Clay said, that a call had been made on the President for a copy of a  document which has been published and extensively circulated by the papers in  this city—a document intimately connected with the safety of the treasure of  the country. The call for it was made under the ull conviction that the Senate  ought to have that document. It had been refused, under the pretext that the  rights of the Chief Magistrate were invaded by it. He always would be disposed  to respect the rights of every public officer, but the President could have no  more confidence in his rights, then I feel in the rights of the Senate. The  right o the Senate to call for this paper was founded on the ground that the  whole world was already in possession of it. It was made because the document  was sent forth to the American people upon an all-important subject, and  because it was the right of the Senate to have it. Nor was it made because the  call was in violation of precedent or an established usage. But the President  has refused to give us this document, and it was not necessary to proceed  further in the pursuit. One result happens from it. The President don’t deny  the genuineness o the paper. It is before the world, and as we have endeavored  to get it, and it has been refused, I have a right to take the next best  evidence of the document, and that is as it has been published in the official  paper. In every instance, therefore, where I have occasion to use it, I shall  avail myself of that publication of it, as genuine.</p><p>  Mr Grundy said he thought when the proposition was made, that it was a very  unnecessary procedure.</p><p>  Here the presiding office interposed that the debate was out of order unless  some motion was intended to be made.</p><p>  Mr Grundy said he intended to love, before he concluded, that the message be  laid on the table; and then resumed—</p><p>  That he thought it unnecessary, because we only wanted evidence when facts had  not come to our knowledge, or when they are denied.—Now, he believed that both  friends and enemies admitted this document to be genuine—to be what it  purported to be. He therefore had thought that nothing beneficial could result  from this proposition, and this was what induced him to vote against it. The  President has given his objection to complying with the call, and what is it?  Why, that the Senate has asked for a private communication from the Chief  Magistrate to his Cabinet. He, [Mr. G.} would never question the propriety of  the motives of the Senator who wanted this information. But the President has.  <em>Note: Clay was a former nominee for the office of the President</em></p><p align="center">IN SENATE.</p><p align="right">WEDNESDAY, December 11, 1833.</p><p>  Mr Bibb, pursuant to notice given, presented certain joint resolutions  providing or an alteration in the Constitution of the United States, in  relation to the mode of electing the President, and Vice President, and then  moved to lay the same on the table and print them. Mr. B. said he felt no  disposition to press the consideration of the resolutions now, and therefore  moved that the second Monday in January next be assigned for taking them up,  and also the resolutions offered by Mr. Benton somedays since, on the same  subject, at the same time; which was agreed to.</p><p>  Mr Clay moved the consideration of Mr Benton’s resolution, relative to the  amount of moneys in deposite [sic] at particular periods in the Bank of the  United States.</p><p><em>Apparently a line is missing here</em></p><p>  Said that it is a matter which you have no regiht to interrogate him about;  and his opinion is, too, that to comply with the request would be setting a  dangerous precedent. He [Mr G.] was not inclined to sat any thing on the  subject of the removal of the deposits, when that matter should come up for  consideration. But if he did, he could not, even if he were so disposed, speak  of that paper as any other than a genuine one, or deny its authenticity. He  therefore moved to key the message on the table; which was agreed to.</p><p align="center">HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</p><p align="right">Friday, Dec, 13, 1833</p><p>  The Speaker presented to the House a memorial from Messrs. Gilpin, McElderry,  and Wager, the three Government Directors of the Bank of the United State, in  relation to the conduct of the Directors, and especially of the President of  that institution.</p></dd>
