It must be as separate from  slavery, as from intemperance. The nation groans under the burden and misery  and guilt of both these sins. It is the solemn duty of the church to clear  itself from both these tremendous crimes. This is not addressed to the world,  for the world legalizes the traffic in rum, and in the bodies and souls of  men. But it is addressed to the children of God, who, if they know and do  their duty, can have no possible connection with either of these trades. If  increasing light has shown that christians ought not to buy and sell ardent  spirits, much more it is believed, will increasing light show that christians  ought not to buy human beings.</p><p>  The Rev. John Newton, even after he became pious, transported Africans in  chains across the Atlantic, to be sold with their posterity into slavery.  Could he have been a true christian, and have no upbraidings of conscience  while so engaged? Yes. How is it possible? It was legal, and, at that time,  honorable, and his mind was not enlightened.—Afterwards when it was he  lamented his error. So there are in our country those who buy and sell their  fellow beings, who, if their minds were enlightened, would lament and  relinquish it.</p><p>  A few years ago, a man, whose whole daily earnings were required by his  family, set up forty nights to run a distillery for forty dollars, which he  gave to build a house of worship.—How could he think that money obtained by  changing the bread of the poor, into the liquid fire of death, acceptable to  God? Because his mind was in darkness. Would he do it now? No. Neither would  the church now receive it. Why? Because the light of the temperance  reformation has burst forth.</p><p>  Christians! who have promised supreme obedience to Him, that :tasted death for  every man,: and more for the rich man, who, in a superb dress, rides in a  superb carriage, to a superb church, to worship in superb style, than for the  poor African, who pulls cotton in the “fields of Alabama, and naked as in the  hour of birth, trembles under the blasts of mid winter”—on you is this call  for a reformation in the church of that God, who declares himself no respector  [sic] of persons.—Why do you exclude the dealer in ardent spirits from the  communion table, and invite to it the dealer in human flesh? This could not,  would not be, if there had been half so much effort made to show the utter  abominations of christian slavery, as there has been to show the abominations  of christian drunkenness. Whatever maybe the event of slavery and intemperance  in the world a sufficiency of light will show, and cause to be removed  these&nbsp; shocking deformities of the christian church. One denomination has  already raised thousands of dollars to assist their brethren in becoming free  from the deep stains of this awful sin. When will other denominations be  equally sincere and active to cleanse themselves from this pollution? The  answer is plain. When they are as conscientious and as much enlightened.</p><p>  To have light poured on this subject as its importance demands, it is proposed  to raise fifty dollars, as a premium for the best essay on this deeply  interesting subject. When the church if pure, we may then expect the smiles  and approbation of heaven on our now almost divided land. And oh!
