    <p>  "Mr. Judson’s Circular,” from the<br>  <em>Genius of Temperance</em>  , in<br>  <em>The Unionist</em>  1:2:3, column 4<br></p><p>  MR. JUDSON’S CIRCULAR— We have seen a Circular written by Andrew T. Judson,<br>  Canterbury, in vindication of his conduct towards Miss Crandall, and in favor<br>  of the new law, under which she was imprisoned. It is a very lame affair: much<br>  more so than we should have expected from a lawyer, aspiring to a seat in<br>  Congress. He does not even make a<br>  <em>plausible</em>  defence. The very<br>  <em>plea</em>  must insure<br>  <em>condemnation</em>  among republicans. Miss Crandall’s school, according to Mr. Judson, is to be<br>  legislated down—<br>  <em>not</em>  because colored people are not human beings—“created free and equal”—not<br>  because they are not entitled to education—<br>  <em>not</em>  because the object is undesirable—<br>  <em>not</em>  because Miss Crandall was incompetent to teach them—<br>  <em>not</em>  because the town was in danger (as had been pretended) of being overrun with<br>  paupers, but because Miss Crandall is an<br>  <em>abolitionist!</em>  A fine TEST ACT, truly! Why not because she is a Baptist? A large portion of<br>  the Baptists, and of other sects, we trust, are rapidly embracing the heresy<br>  against which “His Grace, the” [American] “Lord Bishop of Canterbury” has<br>  fulminated his papal bull. And so the abolitionists are legally disqualified<br>  from school teaching, are they? From what will they next be debarred? From<br>  preaching? From medical and from legal practice? From buying and selling? as<br>  rumor even now reports of Canterbury, and as the Revelator of Patmos has<br>  predicted, of the latter days?”&nbsp; (Rev.xiii.17.)<br></p><p>  Mr. Judson pleads in favor of Canterbury legislation, that the people of<br>  <em>other</em>  towns, would be as unwilling as those of Canterbury, to see a similar school<br>  established, and then to strengthen this, by<br>  <em>another</em>  plea, he complains because Miss Crandall did not accept his offer to remove<br>  her<br>  <em>location!</em>  This savors of the Irish, as well as of the Romish bull! Much in the same vein<br>  of logic, Mr. Judson defends the<br>  <em>Connecticut</em>  law, by remarking that schools might be established in<br>  <em>other</em>  states! Above all, the<br>  <em>present</em>  law of Connecticut,<br>  <em>against</em>  the free and unrestrained education of the colored people, Mr. Judson argues,<br>  <em>cannot</em>  be<br>  <em>bad,</em>  BECAUSE a<br>  <em>former</em>  law of that state, (as yet unrepealed—a law,—he<br>  <em>might</em>  have said—enacted when<br>  <em>all</em>  the people of Connecticut were “abolitionists,” and ere the cunning device of<br>  Colonziationism was dreamed of)—is a<br>  <em>good</em>  one and contains<br>  <em>contrary</em>  characteristics!”<br></p><p align="center">“A Daniel! still I say, a second Daniel!”</p><p>  Mr. Judson must certainly be sent to Congress! –<br>  <em>Genius of Temperance</em></p>
