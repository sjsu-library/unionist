Grant, in a speech of great<br>  length, laid before the House, the propositions of Government for regulating<br>  the affairs of the East India Company, to the effect that the trade to China<br>  should be thrown open; and that it is expedience the Government of India<br>  should remain in the hands of the Company subject to regulations to be<br>  prescribed by Parliament.<br></p><p>  LONDON, June 12.—The House last night resolved itself into a Committee on<br>  Colonial Slavery, when the resolution empowering Ministers to grant 20,000,000<br>  <em>l.</em>  as compensation to the West India Planters came under consideration.<br></p><p>The resolution was adopted 286 to 77.</p><p>  It was said that a Spanish army, to cooperate with that of Don Miguel, had<br>  been ordered to be collected on the frontiers of Portugal.<br></p><p align="center">PORTUGAL.</p><p>  OFORTO, June 4.—On Saturday night and Sunday morning, the 1<br>  <sup>st</sup>  and 2d inst. the first division of the much talked of squadron of steamers<br>  arrived off the bar, with reinforcements of troops, money, provisions and<br>  stores. This seasonable addition to the forces previously collected here has<br>  infused fresh vigor into the Constitutional party. Among the passengers<br>  brought by these four steamers were the Duke of Fayal (better known by nis<br>  former title of Marquis de Palmella,) Captain Napier, R.N. (the successor of<br>  Admiral Sartorius,) and others.<br></p><p>  The Pedroite batteries have completely silenced the Gaya by well directed shot<br>  and shells, exploding in its embrasures, and blowing into the air, gun<br>  carriages, bodies, &amp;c., till the soldiers have actually refused doing duty<br>  in this slaughterhouse, as they call it, from whence they are said to remove<br>  the long guns.<br></p><p>  Admiral Sartorius retires from the service on account of ill health, and<br>  Captain Napier is to assume the command of the fleet. The latter is<br>  represented to be a very smart and efficient officer.<br></p><p align="center">TURKEY AND RUSSIA.</p><p><em>Extract of a letter from Constantinople, dated May 22</em></p><p>  ‘We are very glad to observe that Government is sending reinforcements into<br>  the Mediterranean. It is high time they take some steps, or they will be too<br>  late. Russia has got the start of England and France, and notwithstanding the<br>  continued assurances given us that peace is made with Egypt, yet Russia<br>  continues pouring troops in here as fast as her means of transport from Odessa<br>  will permit; fresh troops are daily arriving. They are not, however, landed on<br>  the Bosphorus, but a few miles to the eastward of the entrance. By this means<br>  they mask their numbers. One or two of the castles at the entrance have been<br>  given up to them, and they are strengthening themselves as fast as they can;<br>  they have also a number of engineers and men working at the Dardanelles. What<br>  all this may end in we cannot say; appearances are any thing but favorable for<br>  a continuation of peace. The Ottoman Government, we fear, must fall.”<br></p><p align="center">FROM FRANCE.</p><p>  FRANCE AND THE UNITED STATES.—On the 11<br>  <sup>th</sup>  of June the Chamber of Deputies received a communication from the Ministers of<br>  Finance, who offered a bill opening a credit for above five millions of<br>  francs, for the payment of the first fifth part of the 25 millions owing the<br>  United States, according to treaty.<br></p><p align="center">TEN DAYS LATER</p><p>  By the packet ship Roscoe, Captain Rogers, we have English papers to June 25<br>  <sup>th</sup>  . By the packet ship Rhone, we have French papers to June 18<br>  <sup>th</sup>  .<br></p><p>  The bill for the abolition of West India Slavery has passed the House of<br>  Commons and been sent to the Lords.<br></p><p>  CONSTANTINOPLE, May 28.—(By Express.) Ibrahim Pacha has really commenced his<br>  retreat, and preparations are making in the Russian camp, which indicate the<br>  speedy withdrawal of the troops.<br></p><p>  ENGLAND.—Mr Elliot Cresson<br>  <em>has declined</em>  the challenge of Mr. Garrison to a public discussion in London on the merits<br>  of the American Colonization society.<br></p><p>  The advices from Warsaw state that the feeling against the Russians was daily<br>  becoming more violent.
