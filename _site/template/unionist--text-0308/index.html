The 14<br>  <sup>th</sup>  District had two or three representatives who were either wholly Jackson men,<br>  or sometimes acted as such; now we believe not a man goes from that district<br>  who is not decidedly Anti-Jackson. Last year the Jackson party carried one of<br>  the Senators in this county. This year both Senators are Anti-Jackson, and<br>  elected by decisive majorities. Instead of a respectable majority<br>  <em>for</em>  Pearl, as was the case last year, the 13<br>  <sup>th</sup>  District now gives more than 300 majority<br>  <em>against</em>  him. The intelligence which we have received from other quarters is of much<br>  the same character.

    <h4>Commentary</h4>
      <p>Philip Pearl Jr. was defeated in his re-election bid to the State Senate, a blow to the public legitimacy of the Black Law. <em>The Unionist</em> happily reports that "Jacksonism in this State is prostrated." The editors refrain from "affect[ing]<br>  an indifference which we do not feel at this result, for it is the<br>  accomplishment of the wish which we expressed in our prospectus, that the rule<br>  of the present dynasty might be brief; but though we rejoice, we feel no<br>  disposition to indulge in extravagant exultation at the defeat of Jacksonism."</p>
