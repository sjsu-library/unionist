    <p>Liberator.</p><p>THE SPIRIT OF SEVENTY-SIX</p><p>  The following extract we venture to make from a long epistle recently<br>  addressed to us, by the venerable GEORGE BENSON of Brooklyn, Connecticut, the<br>  present estimable President of the New-England Anti-Slavery Society. He is an<br>  abolitionist of the old school, and commenced at the earliest period with<br>  Clarkson and Wilberforce, for the suppression of the foreign slave trade.<br>  Although far advanced in years, he is in vigorous possession of his mental<br>  faculties; and his hand writing is firm and plain, to a marvel.<br></p><p>  “I observed in a late Boston paper, that the annual meeting of the Peace<br>  Society was to convene in that city. Several weeks since I addressed a letter<br>  to a friend in Hartford, who is actively engaged in the Pacific cause, and<br>  informed him that I considered the cause of Peace and the abolition of Slavery<br>  to be so inseparably connected, that wherever one society existed, the other<br>  should be located&nbsp; in its vicinity; and my opinion originates from the<br>  import of the sacred hymn, chanted by the angelic host at the advent of our<br>  blessed Saviour—‘Peace on earth and<br>  <em>good will to men.</em>  ’ And how can we exercise this good will on a more important and urgent<br>  occasion, than to rescue our fellow men from the matchless and oppressive<br>  cruelties of slavery?<br></p><p>  It is universally admitted that the first Congress in the United States was<br>  composed of the most pure and enlightened citizens, who, on the 6<br>  <sup>th</sup>  of July, 1775, announced the following sentiments:<br></p><p>  ‘If it were possible for men, who exercise their reason, to believe that the<br>  Divine Author of our existence intended a part of the human race to hold an<br>  absolute property in, and unbounded power over others, marked out by infinite<br>  goodness and wisdom, as the objects of a legal domination never rightfully<br>  resistible, however, however severe and oppressive—the inhabitants of these<br>  Colonies might at least require from the Parliament of Great Britain, some<br>  evidence that this dreadful authority over them has been granted to that<br>  body.’<br></p><p>  May not the poor slaves emphatically adopt the same inquiry of their lordly<br>  oppressors?<br></p><p>  Again, in 1779, a pamphlet appeared, published by order of Congress, which<br>  contains the following opinion:<br></p><p>  ‘The great principle (of government) I, that men are by nature free, as<br>  accountable to Him that made them, they must be so, and so long as we have any<br>  idea of Divine Justice, we must associate that of human freedom.’<br></p><p>  Now, it appears evident to me, that the above recited sentiments authorize and<br>  sanction an avowed opposition to slavery, and even censure those who think<br>  otherwise, as being destitute of any correct opinion of Divine Justice.<br></p>
