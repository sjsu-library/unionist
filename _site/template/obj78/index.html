    <em>Wonderful memory of Blind Alick.</em>—There is still living at Stirling, a blind old beggar known to all the countryround by the name of blind Alick, who possesses a memory of almost incrediblestrength. It was observed with astonishment, that, when he was a man, andobliged, by the death of his parents, to gain a livelihood by begging throughthe streets of his native town of Stirling, he knew the whole of the Bible, bothOld and New Testaments, by heart! From which you may repeat any passage, and hewill tell you the chapter and verse; or you may tell him the chapter and verse,and he will repeat to you the passage, word for word. Not long since, agentleman, to puzzle him, read, with a slight verbal alteration, a verse of theBible. Alick hesitated a moment, and then told where it was to be found but saidit had not been correctly delivered; he then gave it as it stood in the book,correcting the slight error that had been purposely introduced. The gentlemanthen asked him for the 90<sup>th</sup>verse of the 7<sup>th</sup>chapter of Numbers. Alick was again puzzled for a moment, but then said hastily,“You are fooling me, sir? there is no such verse—that chapter has only 89verses.” Several other experiments of the sort were tried upon him with the samesuccess. He has often been questioned the day after any particular sermon orspeech, and his examiners have invariably found, that, had their patienceallowed, blind Alick would have given them the sermon or speech over again.
