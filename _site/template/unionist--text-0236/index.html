    <p>From the Windham County Advertiser</p><p>  “In the last Norwich Republican, some remarks appear respecting the late fire<br>  on the premises of Miss Crandall, in the course of which the editor of this<br>  paper is alluded to in a manner that will, unless explained, greatly lessen<br>  that confidence and respect, which we have hitherto cherished towards the<br>  Republican, and our faith in the integrity of its editor. In the article of<br>  which we speak, an “assertion” is attributed to us, which we never made,<br>  either in public or in private. (a) it also falsely states that we have<br>  declined making any disavowal” of a knowledge of the [indecipherable]<br>  “affair.” Such a disavowal<br>  <em>has</em>  been made, in a letter to Miss Crandall, which has since been published. (b)<br>  The Republican had better search for<br>  <em>facts,</em>  before it asserts any thing on the authority of the Unionist; (c) and when<br>  those facts are found, the writer of the article of which we complain, will be<br>  made fully acquainted with the injustice he has done us. (d)<br></p><p>  (a)We have not the Advertiser at our command in which the assertion referred<br>  to, is published. Consequently we are not convinced that we were mistaken.<br></p><p>  (b)We are rejoiced to hear this. Such disavowal have never met our eye,<br>  although we seldom fail to give the Advertiser a thorough examination.<br></p><p>  (c)At present we entertain a good opinion of Messrs. Burleighs. Their paper<br>  (the Unionist) aside from its practical character, appears to be conducted<br>  with much discernment. Its junior editor, Mr. Wm. Burleigh was taught the<br>  rudiments of printing by ourself—and notwithstanding his disobedience caused<br>  us to discharge him form our employ, yet commands our respect. He appears to<br>  be possessed of talents, which, with proper cultivation, may enable him to<br>  obtain an enviable reputation. Give “the devil his due,” is an old saying,<br>  brother Holbrook.<br></p><p>  (d)We are sorry, very sorry, if any remarks of ours have caused thee to feel<br>  unpleasant. We can truly say that nothing was more foreign from our<br>  intentions. Help us to the “facts,” brother, and they shall be duly published<br>  in the Republican.”<br></p>
