    As the Unionist has requested, we have reperused our remarks upon the conduct<br>and designs of the abolitionists, and we find little to modify and nothing to<br>retract. To the charge of severity and injustice towards the characters of the<br>leaders in this crusade, we reply—<br><em>Physician heal thyselfˆ–</em>clear your own eyes of motes and films before you proceed to pull out beams from<br>the eyes of others. The whole vocabulary of abuse and contumely has been<br>exhausted by the abolitionists in their attempts to defame the motives and<br>blacken the characters of the members of the Colonization society—so that now we<br>scarcely see aught else in the columns of the Liberator and Emancipator, but<br>numerous repetitions of the same false and unfounded charges. Indeed, one would<br>think, from the matter contained in those papers, that their<br><em>sole</em>object is to destroy the Colonization society; as if that being accomplished,<br>every thing else was easy. Now let the merits of abolitionism be ten times what<br>its warmest abettors assert, no reasonable objection can be made to the<br>Colonization Society whatever. It proposes to transport free blacks to Africa<br>with their own consent, and if the blacks are willing to go, pray may not<br><em>free white</em>men give their money for the purpose without asking the consent of the President<br>of the Anti-Slavery Society? Where was the kindness and charity of Garrison, yea<br>more, where was his regard for moral probity, when he said that his object in<br>going to England was to raise funds for the establishment of a manual labor<br>school—and now, since his return, he acknowledges that he was induced to the<br>voyage by a desire to represent (misrepresent he should have said) the object<br>and designs of the Colonization Society to the English. That he slandered his<br>countrymen in London, there is abundant proof. Since he returned, he denies<br>it—so that no less than four falsehoods lie at his door, without the possibility<br>of any good accruing from either. How much was there “of the law of kindness as<br>well as of the requisitions of justice” in the latter which the patron of the<br>Unionist wrote to some students, and which he requested might be published; when<br>he said that he looked upon the Colonization Society<br><em>in no other light than an emissary of Satan</em>—whose only object is to perpetuate slavery? And who have been more frequently<br>accused of falsehood and misrepresentation than Rev. Mr. Gurley and Mr. Finley?<br>We do not ask these questions to justify ourselves if we have done wrong, but<br>merely to, let our “brother” see that it ill becomes him to throw stones. Till<br>he &amp; his sect are free from sin they should be slow in condemning others. As<br>to what we asserted concerning the leaders in the abolition enterprize, we deem<br>it strictly true. When they are told that the constitution forbids the free<br>states from meddling with property at the south, they reply in the language of<br>the Apostle to the Jewish Ruler—we must obey God and not man—thus asserting<br>their independence of the laws under which we live. If they respect the laws,<br>why does not Miss Crandall dismiss her school? Till the decision of Judge Dagget<br>is over ruled, that decision is the law of the land, which every honest citizen<br>is bound to respect—and yet we see the Genius of Temperance, (the Editors of<br>which call themselves Christians par excellence) encouraging her to continue in<br>opposition to a decree of one of the highest tribunals in the state. We find the<br>abolitionists endeavoring to cast contempt upon the Colonization Society,<br>because the latter speak of what is expedient to be done, in opposition to the<br>designs of the&nbsp; former—and meeting in the&nbsp; writings of a gentleman of<br>talents and learning, a quotation about&nbsp; expediency being “a wrap-rascal,”<br>they have rung the charges upon it, till it has fairly become stale, not<br>forgetting in the excess of their charity to insinuate that whoever may doubt of<br>the expediency of a measure, there can be no question as to the character which<br>such person&nbsp; should sustain in their own immaculate conceptions. Did these<br>over scrupulous gentlemen every hear or read of one who said that “all things<br>are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient.” In the present state of<br>the country immediate and unconditional abolition is neither<br><em>expedient</em>nor<br><em>lawful</em>—and those engaged in promoting it are only planting the seeds of sedition. Let<br>them beware that in sowing the wind, the do not reap the whirlwind.<br>
