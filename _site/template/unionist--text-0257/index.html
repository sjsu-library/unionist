    <p align="center"><em>From The U.S. Gazette.</em></p><p>  MELANCHOLY ACCIDENT — Yesterday afternoon, (Wednesday 5<br>  <sup>th</sup>  inst.) about 5 o’clock P.M. just as the William Penn, with about 150<br>  passengers, from Baltimore, had come round the point, below this city,<br>  (Philadelphia,) she was discovered to be on fire near the furnace. The<br>  rapidity of her motion creating a strong draft, and the very combustible<br>  nature of every piece of wood near the fire, soon rendered it certain that the<br>  boat would be lost. She was accordingly run ashore on the muddy margin of the<br>  river, before reaching which she seemed to be in one full blaze. Here the<br>  passengers jumped out; and most of their baggage and part of the great<br>  Southern Mail were thrown ashore. Many of the passengers jumped overboard. A<br>  steamboat went down and brought up from the wreck most of the passengers to<br>  the usual landing place.<br></p><p>  We learned late Wednesday evening, that the dead bodies of a gentleman and<br>  lady were taken from the river.<br></p><p>  Several lives were saved by the hazardous exertions of persons belonging to<br>  the boat, and by those who were drawn to the scene. From the great number of<br>  passengers, and the confusion consequent on such an awful scene, it was<br>  impossible to ascertain with any degree of certainty the extent of personal<br>  injury sustained.<br></p><p>  Some of the passengers stripped themselves, jumped into the river and swam<br>  ashore—they ere taken up almost perishing from the cold.<br></p><p>  It was mentioned to us that a lady in company with the Rev. Dr. Mitchellmore,<br>  of Lewistown, Del. jumped into river in her consternation. Mr. M. followed her<br>  and was drowned. At our last information hopes were entertained of recovering<br>  the lady.<br></p><p>Col. Joseph S. Porter is among the drowned.</p><p>One man drifted out into the river on a settee, but was finally saved.</p><p>  When the boat was run ashore, she run with her bows into the mid, and her<br>  stern in deep water—the fire was raging so intensely in the centre of the<br>  boat, as to prevent the passengers who were aft, from going forward—they<br>  therefore jumped into the water beyond their depth.<br></p><p>  We regret to add, the lady mentioned above, died between 8 and 9 o’clock. She<br>  was in a delicate state of health. The body has been removed by the Coroner to<br>  Cherry Hill, where it will remain for a short time, for recognition.<br></p><p>  The fire took in the wood house. The boat was burnt to the water’s edge—the<br>  loss sustained is about $70,000.<br></p>
