    We finish this week, the Report of Mr. Olney’s Trial, as furnished us by MR.<br>FOSTER, a young gentleman of acknowledged skill and fidelity as a reporter; and<br>in this presenting to the public an impartial statement of the testimony in the<br>case, we cannot but repeat our expression of astonishment that a man should have<br>been arrested and bound over for trial, against whom there was not a shadow of<br>proof—not even enough to have fixed suspicion upon a man of generally suspicious<br>character, much less upon Olney, whose character stands as fair, as that of any<br>person concerned in his arrest, examination, or trial. A man who can come out<br>from such a trial, not only with a triumphant acquittal, but with a character so<br>perfectly fair and unimpeached, notwithstanding all the pains which had been<br>taken beforehand to hunt up something against him—the inquiries among his<br>fellow-townsmen, where a man’s errors are likely to be known if he has committed<br>any serious ones—has certainly abundant reason to complain of the injustice of<br>being subject to so much trouble and expense on so slight grounds—rather so<br>utterly without any grounds, as Mr. Olney has been. We do not much wonder that<br>the Advertiser, the organ of those concerned in the arrest and prosecution of<br>Olney, should contain a Report of the evidence, (probably from the pen of Judson<br>himself, or some of his partizans,) so discolored in various parts, as to have<br>quite a different impression on the mind of readers who heard none of the<br>testimony, from that which the testimony itself would have left if they had<br>heard it. We do not much wonder, for instance, that the Advertiser’s report<br>should entirely leave out that part of Maria Robinson’s testimony in which she<br>says that Mr. Olney had not been alone in the room more than a minute before the<br>fire was discovered, thus showing it to have been absolutely impossible that he<br>could have fired the house. We mention this as one example of the accuracy of<br>that report, but any one who will compare it carefully with Mr. Foster’s, will<br>find many other features of dissimilarity calculated to weaken the strongly<br>unfavorable impressions which an accurate report would have produced, towards<br>those at whose instance Olney was arrested.<br>
