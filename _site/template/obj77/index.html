    <p align="center">[From the New-York Observer.]</p><p align="center">  SALISBURY CATHEDRAL—STONEHENGE—THE SHEPHERD OF SALISBURY PLAIN</p><p align="right">  <em>Salisbury, July</em>  2, 1833.</p><p>  The shepherd of Salisbury Plain, Stonehenge, Old Sarum, and Salisbury  Cathedral are things of some note. The latter is distinguished for its lofty  spire, four hundred feet; for the purity and uniformity of its architecture,  external and internal; and for the warped condition of the columns of masonry,  which support the tower and spire, under the amazing weight that rests upon  them, and then look us and observe [indecipherable] ready to be crushed. And  the only reason why it is presumed they will remain, is because they have  already endured for ages under the same appearances. An extra fixture has been  thrown in for protection, interposing a monstrous blemish in the perspective  of the transept. Aside from this the pure Gothic of the entire edifice,  constitutes the rarest beauty of the kind in the British Isles. It was built  in the thirteenth century—the spire having been since added, the top of which  inclines 22 inches from a perpendicular line, in consequence of the warping of  its supports. An old man now between seventy and eighty, has been accustomed  to ascend once in a twelve month for many years to oil the weather vane. He  gets out at a window a few feet below the top, scrambles like a squirrel by  some iron net work at the giddy elevation of four hundred feet, performs his  office, and descends with all the self-possession of a sailor. This year,  however, he has been unable to do his duty on account of the infirmities of  age.</p><p>  I rode this morning in a fly, a sort of hackney-coach, drawn by a couple of  mules, to  <em>Stonehenge,</em>  about eight miles from the town, situated in the heart of Salisbury plain, and  standing insolated in all the grandeur of its mysterious and hitherto  unexplained history. It is a truly sublime object—sublime in itself, as  filling the mind with wonder, where the stones came from, how they could have  been brought there, and placed in their relative positions! The heaviest  columns are rated at seventy tons—the whole number being ninety-four, as near  as can be ascertained, although the present confusion of the assemblage  renders it difficult to count them. It is supposed to have been a Druidical  temple, where human sacrifices were offered—a superstition as sublime as it  was diabolical, as mysterious as cruel! The rude grandeur of the work  demonstrates the barbarity of the age. There are no indications, that this  place of sacrifice was ever enclosed by walls, or covered by a roof. It is  encircled indeed by the traces of a ditch and a corresponding embankment, and  the columnar ranges of stones were set up in circular lines, at greater  distance from each other than the space occupied. About half an acre is  enclosed by the circumvallation, and a quarter of an acre occupied by the  temple itself. The only junction of the structure if structure it can be  called, appears to have been the resting of the amazing cross and horizontal  slabs on the largest columns, about 20 ft. high &amp; 15 asunder, most of  which have fallen, some are inclined, and a few only standing erect. Tenons  were left on the top of the perpendicular columns, entering grooves of the  horizontal pieces laid upon them. It is barely possible, that the mechanical  powers of the present age could set up an edifice like this; but the rudeness  of the work does not naturally suggest the knowledge and application of such  powers at the time of its creation. Hence the wonder.</p><p>  It is said by some, that the same material is not to be found in this island.  It is incredible, however, that these immense rocks should have been shipped;  and almost equally incredible, that they should have been transported any  considerable distance on trundles; and yet they were never found in this  vicinity. Many of them are reduced to nearly right angles, but more exhibit a  smooth, or properly plane surface. There is nothing like the skill of masonry  bestowed upon them. They are perhaps purposely left in this rude state, as  emblematic of the stern and inexorable rites which they were set up to  witness. The supposed altar piece lies in the centre, embedded in the earth,  and directly behind it two of the largest columns supported the heaviest  cross-beam—but the columns have inclined and dropped their burden.</p><p>  There are other relics of the kind in the island, but none so stupendous. All  the parts of a similar temple have been transferred at great expense from the  island of Jersey, and set up on the estate of a private gentleman at  Henley-on-Thames, now the property of a Mr. Maitland. I stumbled upon it the  other day in rambling over the grounds with a friend, and found it perched on  a hill some four or five hundred feet above the bed of the Thames. It was  brought over by a former governor of the island, Gen. Conway, who then owned  Park-place, on which it now stands. It is of course a small chapel, compared  with  <em>Stonehenge</em>  on Salisbury Plain—but many of the stones are of several tons weight. They are  rude and shapeless.</p><p>  There are numerous marks of ancient military fortifications, scattered over  Salisbury Plain; and tumuli of the ancient dead, such as are to be found in  the Western regions of our own country, lift up their heads in various  quarters, and sometimes in groups.</p><p>  Old Sarum, of recent fame, as a rotten borough of England, sending two members  to Parliament under the late  <em>regime</em>  , is a naked fortification in ruins, two miles from Salisbury. It is as  desolate as the crown of Ben Nevis in Scotland.</p><p>  My sensations in visiting Stonehenge were the result of a singular combination  of the grateful recollections of Mrs. More’s Shepherd and his family, and of  the actual scenes before me. “The Shepherd of Salisbury Plain” was continually  ringing in my ear, and all his history passing before me, as I rode over these  undulating, naked, and apparently boundless fields, among the tumuli and  traces of ancient fortifications, and came at last to gaze upon and admire  this wonder-exciting and unaccountable relic of a barbarous age and bloody  superstition. What a demonstration of man’s susceptibilities of religious  affections, of a sense of guilt, of his need of atonement, and of the dreadful  errors, into which he may be plunged without the guidance of a divine  revelation!</p>
