    <p align="right">FOR THE UNIONIST.</p><p>  “Philosophy, though eagle-eyed in nature’s tendencies” has not succeeded in  drawing a line of discrimination between the members of the human family, so  marked as to proscribe from the commonwealth of humanity those who Cowper says  are “guilty of a skin not colored like his own.” Indeed if my complexion does  afford proof that I am not so nobly born, not endowed with the same  unalienable privileges and rights as those of a different color, I declare  that I am not ambitious of attaining their prerogatives, by changing skins  with any of them—and much less do I repine at the decrees of Him who has made  of one blood all the nations of the earth.</p><p>  Though in the New-England States color is not deemed a sufficient offence to  consign the limbs of the tawny inhabitant to the shackle, and his back to the  scourge, yet the prejudices of the South are not wholly unfelt in the North;  although the fetter falls from the limb of the African, when his foot touches  the New England soil, still there lingers about the heart of a yankee some of  that bitterness and contempt towards his colored brethren, which forged  galling chains for that oppressed race.</p><p>  Many specious arguments have been advanced to prove the justness of African  Slavery, and although many honest men have met and refuted them, others have  allowed themselves to be wheedled into the comfortable idea, that they are  made of better clay, and entitled to more consideration, than their degraded  sufferers. Let me call upon  <em>you</em>  , who have still a small proportion of humanity left in your bosoms, to start  from the siren flaterers, who would lull you to repose, while thousand of your  fellow creatures groan beneath the lash of unfeeling tyrants, under the flag  of a nation professing to be guided by the law of Liberty, and Equal Rights!  Have you not professed to the world, that “ALL MEN ARE BORN FREE AND EQUAL.”  Is not this mockery? Are not these very letters shaded by the crimson blood of  your suffering brethren? Or  <em>are not</em>  Africans men? Tyrant, does not your bleeding slave while kneeling to you for  mercy, address you in the language of human nature—and do not  <em>you</em>  prove yourself incapable of appreciating that language? ‘Tis  <em>you</em>  who seem less than a man, and most devoid of every principle, every attribute  of humanity.</p><p>  One miserable refuge, behind which the slave-holder retreats, is this; that  many slaves are very well satisfied with their situation and would not wish to  change it!” Very fine indeed! Because you have reduced them to this abject  dependence, and perverted all the noble independence of their nature, you have  a right to trample upon their undeniable rights, and continue the iniquitous  business! Because a blind man loves the taste of arsenic, (being ignorant of  its deadly tendency) you will thrust it down his throat! From what must that  contentedness arise, which induces the slave to embrace the scourge and hub  the fetter. Would  <em>you</em>  be content to drudge for a master, and crouch at his feet like a dog? You say  “death before slavery,” and you would despise a white man who would submit to  the degradation of unlimited subordination. Because a wretch who is weary of  life requests you to shoot him, would you be justified in blowing his brains  out with a pistol? Answer these questions ye advocates for slavery, and if  “custom has not steeled your hearts” to every principle of rectitude, you will  see that mercy to a negro entitles you to no praise, since he has the same  claim to liberty and respect as a European.</p><p align="right">CATO.</p>
