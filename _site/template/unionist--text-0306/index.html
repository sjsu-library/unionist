    <p>From Zerah Colburn’s Memoirs.</p><p>A REMARKABLE INCIDENT.</p><p>  “In the beginning of 1815, a circumstance took place that excited much<br>  interest in Paris. A surgeon in the army, named Dautun, was arrested in a<br>  gambling house, in the Palais Royal, on the testimony of a scar on his wrist.<br>  Some time previous, the officers of the night had found while passing their<br>  rounds, in different parts of the city, four parcels tied up; one containing<br>  the head, another the trunk, a third the thighs, and a fourth the legs and<br>  arms of a man. In the teeth, tightly compressed, was a piece of human flesh,<br>  apparently torn out in the dying struggle. The parts were collected, and put<br>  together in their regular order, and exhibited for a number of days at the<br>  Morgue. The mystery which involved this dark transaction excited quite an<br>  interest, and numbers went to see the corpse. The general and only conviction<br>  was the he must have been murdered; but for a number of weeks no clue was<br>  obtained to elicit information on the subject. When it became at length<br>  improper to keep the body any longer above ground, a cast in plaster was<br>  taken, fully representing the murdered victim, and this remained a much longer<br>  time for the public to see. At length Dauton happened to be engaged in<br>  gambling at the Palais Royal; he played high and lost, called for liquor to<br>  drink, and angry because the waiter was somewhat tardy, when he came with it<br>  Dauton emptied the glass and threw it at the waiter. It was shivered into a<br>  thousand pieces, and a fragment was carried into Dautun’s wrist, // under the<br>  cuff of his coat. The spectators gathering around, and learning the accident,<br>  wished to see the gash; he drew down his sleeve, and firmly pressed it round<br>  his wrist; they insisted on seeing it, he obstinately refused. By this course,<br>  the bystanders were at length led to suppose that something mysterious was<br>  involved in this conduct, and they determined at all events to see his wrist.<br>  By force they pushed up his sleeve, and behold a scar recently healed, as if<br>  made by tearing out of flesh, appeared. The landlord had been at Morgue, and<br>  seen the murdered man with the flesh between the teeth, and it struck him in a<br>  moment that the flesh was torn from this man’s wrist. Charging them to keep<br>  him safe, he hastened to call in the legal authorities, and arrested him.<br></p><p>  In the event, Dautun confessed that being quartered at Sedan, and out of<br>  money, he came to Paris to try some adventure. Knowing that his brother had a<br>  large sum by him, directly on his arrival, he went to his lodgings in a<br>  retired part of the city, about eight in the evening. He entered the house<br>  unnoticed by the porter, and passing to his apartment, found his brother<br>  asleep. He immediately commenced the work of death; his brother waking up<br>  defended himself, but in addition to the surprise and horror of the moment,<br>  being in a feeble state of health, all the desperation of his struggle was<br>  overpowered. In the scuffle he tore out the flesh. Being killed, the surgeon<br>  cut up the body, tied it up in four parcels as before mentioned, secured the<br>  money and retired.<br></p><p>  He also confessed that eleven months previous he had murdered an aunt, who was<br>  living with a second husband, to obtain money. Her husband was arrested and<br>  imprisoned for a number of months, but as nothing appeared to criminate him,<br>  he had been discharged. The writer saw the unhappy fratricide on his way from<br>  the prison to the place of execution.<br></p>
