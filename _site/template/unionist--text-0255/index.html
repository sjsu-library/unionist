Uncle Davy Kies seems to think they are<br>  <em>“All Hearty”</em>  but you know he don’t reside at Head-Quarters now. The last orders were dated<br>  at Canterbury a few rods North of Miss Crandall’s school. It was officially<br>  announced here this morning by one of the recruiting officers, (the<br>  <em>gentleman</em>  who ran away from Brooklyn a few years ago with some hundreds of the people’s<br>  money, and who, in consequence of his clamorous declamations in favor of<br>  Jackson, is now enjoying a considerable bite of Uncle Sam’s treasury pap,<br>  against the known wishes of the people,) that Uncle Davy’s Democrats were all<br>  ready for action. That the misunderstanding nad difficulty among the officers<br>  had blown over and all were as good friends as ever. Col. A.T. the commanding<br>  officer, is looking out for promotion. Uncle Davy says when all the officers<br>  of his division get together this Spring at New-Haven, he will have the Col.<br>  appointed Commissary, Judge, or something which he will like much better than<br>  actual service in the field, and thus give a better chance for the under<br>  officers. But the Col. would be altogether out of his place, on the bench. He<br>  would appear, and no doubt feel, much like Jack Downing’s mouse, treed in an<br>  empty flour barrel.—The old gentleman has not concluded yet whether to issue<br>  another Proclamation or not—but he says something must be done to procure more<br>  soldiers. He don’t seem to like the appearance of the old Republican army, and<br>  what looks more cloudy than any thing else, he don’t think it will do to come<br>  into action till he gets a new recruit from Windham. But every good soldier<br>  listed in the Republican army just as soon as&nbsp; they found out what Uncle<br>  Davy and the ‘Arch Bishop’ were up to.

But he don’t care any thing about the office. Col. Spafford is<br>  one of the genuine old fashioned republicans, a straight forward, common sense<br>  man, who, if he should be elected, will do the thing that is right. He is not<br>  for abolishing Sabbath laws, or Thanksgiving laws. He believes in none of the<br>  new-fangled black laws, or New-Haven memorials, but will go straight a-head as<br>  every independent republican should do, supporting such measures only as will<br>  operate equally upon all our citizens. He will never consent, like Mr. Pearl,<br>  to put his eggs in Judson’s basket.<br></p><p align="right">REPUBLICAN ELECTOR</p>
