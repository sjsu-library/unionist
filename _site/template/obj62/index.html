    <p>  (We extract the following from Professor Wright’s pamphlet, entitled “The Sin  of Slavery, and its Remedy.)</p><p>  The American revolution was incomplete. It left one sixth part of the  population the victims of a servitude immeasurably more debasing, than that  from which it delivered the rest. While this nation held up its declaration of  independence—its noble bill of human rights, before an admiring world, in one  hand; it mortified the friends of humanity, by oppressing the poor and  defenceless with the other. The progress of time has not lessened the evil.  There are now held in involuntary and perpetual slavery, in the southern half  of this republic, more than 2,000,000 of men, women, and children, guarded  with a vigilance, which strives, and with success appalling as it is complete,  to shut out every ray of knowledge, human and divine, and reduce them as  nearly as possible to a level with the brutes. These miserable slaves are not  only compelled to labor without choice and without hire, but they are  subjected to the cruelty and lust of their masters to an unbounded extent. I  the northern states there is very generally a sympathy with the slave-holders,  and a prejudice against the slaves, which shows itself in palliating the crime  of slave-holding, and in most unrighteously disregarding the rights, and  vilifying the characters of the free colored men.</p><p>  At the same time, slavery, as a system, is (in a certain sense) condemned. It  is confessed to be a great evil, “a moral evil,” and, when the point is urged,  <em>a sin.</em>  The slaves, it is admitted, have rights—every principle of honesty, justice,  and humanity,  <em>“in the abstract,”</em>  calls aloud that they should be made free. The word of God is in their favour.  Indeed, there is no ground claimed by the abettors of slavery, on which they  pretend to justify it for a moment, but a supposed—a begged—  <em>expediency,</em>  baseless as the driven clouds. I say baseless, for while not a single fact has  ever been produced, going to show the danger of putting the slaves, all at  once, under the protection of law, and employing them as free laborers, there  have been produced, on the other side, varied and fair experiments showing,  that it is altogether safe and profitable.</p><p>  In this state of things where had the American church stood? Has she too  sympathized with the hearts of the Pharaohs? Or has she in the spirit of the  martyrs of former times, borne an unflinching testimony against this sin?  Alas! The painful truth stares us in the face. She has come down from the high  and firm foundation of scripture truth, and is professedly at work upon a  floating  <em>expediency,</em>  doing against slavery what cab be done upon the checked current of popular  prejudice.—Speaking through the organ of the Colonization Society, she has  admitted all that the most determined slave-holder could ask, and she is doing  just that, and no more, which so far as he understands the subject, he hails  with pleasure as a safeguard to is property in human bodies and  <em>souls.</em>  This is the testimony of slave-holders themselves—most competent witnesses.</p><p>  Is further evidence needed? When the American Colonization Society, as a  remedy for slavery, has been called in question, as well it might be for its  tardiness, if for no other reason, there has been manifested a determination  to hush inquiry. There has been a most pusillanimous shivering and shrinking  from the probe. Nay, the few men who, in the uncompromising spirit of  Christian benevolence, have urged this inquiry, have been slandered as  disturbers of the public peace,—have been assailed with abusive epithets, not  be slave-holders only, but by their brethren in the bosom of the church.</p><p>  A most singular spectacle is presented in this enlightened and Christian age;  a handful of philanthropists, dare denounce a system of legalized oppression,  and to charge guilt upon all who uphold it; upon this, not only do the  principals in crime, as might be expected, ascribe the whole to sheer malice,  but the leaders of the Christian church, as ought not to be expected, endorse,  and give currency to the charge, and throw the whole weight of their cold and  crushing influence to smother in its cradle this attempt at a gospel  reformation.</p><p>  What does all this mean? Are Christians in these northern states interested in  upholding slavery? Are they unwilling to be convinced that their colored  brethren are better than the slanders of their oppressors would make them? Are  they sure, beyond a doubt, that the colonization scheme will relieve our  country of the might evil which is crushing it? that it is the  <em>Christian</em>  way to relieve it? Are they on good evidence convinced that it is not  <em>expedient</em>  to say to the wicked, “O wicked man, thou shalt surely die?” Must they have  PEACE at any rate—peace, though the groans of millions should ascend and  mingle with the muttering thunders of coming wrath? Will they have it, that if  a word is said against a mere experiment to test the practicability of  rescuing the victim by flattering the oppressor, the whole cause of Christian  benevolence is attacked? If not, why not welcome inquiry? A thorough  investigation—a looking on  <em>both sides,</em>  would surely do no harm. Those defenders of truth who have shunned such  inquiry, have always proved themselves short-sighted. The cause of God courts  scrutiny—its advocates are thrown into no unseemly agitation when they are  most rigorously sifted.</p><p>  The subject cries aloud for more earnest consideration than it has yet  received. More than two millions of outraged, downtrodden men cry out, shall  we die in this sore bondage that white Christians may have the pleasure of  attempting to shun God’s wrath without repenting of sin?—Half a million of  free colored men cry out—America is our country—the land for which  <em>our</em>  fathers bled as well as yours. Why will you seek to banish us? The wrongs of  the poor Indian cry aloud, There is no safety in league with transgressors!  The present political aspect of the South [cries out, that tyrants do not  regard law! Six hundred millions of idolaters cry out to the American church,  “Why pluckest thou the mote out of thy brother’s eye, and behold a beam is in  thine own!”</p>
