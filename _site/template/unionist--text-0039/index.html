    <p align="center">THE JOURNAL OF COMMERCE</p><p align="center"><em>versus.</em></p><p align="center">COL. JUDSON’S LAW.</p><p>  The Journal of Commerce of July 30<br>  <sup>th</sup>  has copied the statement made in the Advertiser of July 25, by Col Judson and<br>  Rufus Adams, Esq. and have made the following remarks upon it.<br></p><p>  We publish to day an article from Canterbury which has appeared in several<br>  papers of that neighborhood. We do so, because we understand it to be a sort<br>  of official declaration of the grounds upon which the law and proceedings<br>  under it, relative to the school for colored children in that town, are to be<br>  defended. We are certainly willing it should have all proper weight. Yet we<br>  must think the ground taken will be very difficult to maintain. The opposition<br>  to the school then, is made because it is a school of immediate abolition<br>  doctrines. This is not the ground of defence which has ever before been taken.<br>  The Report to the Legislature and the Law, both set forth the injurious influx<br>  of blacks from other states as the evil to be prevented. But whether new or<br>  old, the position now assumed is one which cannot be maintained under our<br>  institutions. We have learned, and our constitutions are based upon the<br>  knowledge, that the best way to put down error is by argument, not by law.<br>  That the best way to maintain truth and sound opinions is to leave error<br>  unrestrained. Admitting therefore, that the doctrines of the abolitionists are<br>  never so erroneous, it amounts to nothing in defence of the law; for error,<br>  whether religious, political, scientific, or of whatever sort, is entitled, so<br>  far as the laws are concerned, to set up schools and colleges, and propagate<br>  itself by all peaceable means, as entirely unrestrained as if it were pure<br>  truth. Surely in Connecticut, that focus of toleration, the doctrines of this<br>  defence will find no countenance. As to the improprieties in the manner of<br>  introducing the school, and the abusive anonymous letters which were sent to<br>  the gentlemen, they are certainly not matters which full grown men should set<br>  forth in so formidable a manner. Indeed we think that such a defence as this,<br>  must be with sensible men, their last effort before abandoning the cause.<br></p>
