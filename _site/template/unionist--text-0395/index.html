    <p>FEMALE ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY.</p><p>  On Tuesday afternoon last, the adjourned meeting of the ladies of Brooklyn and<br>  vicinity was held in Mr. Davison’s Hall.<br></p><p>  Prayer was offered by Rev. Mr. May. The committee appointed at the previous<br>  meeting to correspond with other Female Anti-Slavery Societies, reported that<br>  they had written to the Societies, in Philadephia, New-York and Boston. One<br>  letter in answer had been received—and that a very interesting one from<br>  Lucretia Mott of Philadelphia. It was read by Mrs. Herbert Williams.<br></p><p>  The meeting was then addressed at considerable length, and in a very<br>  impressive manner, by Charles Stuart, Esq. He pointed out the peculiarities in<br>  the character and circumstances of woman, which enable her to be an important<br>  instrument in all moral reforms.<br></p><p>  Mr. William Lloyd Garrison and Mr. May also offered some remarks to encourage<br>  the philanthropic, for which the meeting was then convened.<br></p><p>A form of Constitution was then read and adopted as follows:—</p><p>  <em>    Constitution of the Female Anti-Slavery Society of Brooklyn and vicinity.<br>  </em></p><p>  Preamble.—Whereas the system of slavery which exists in a portion of this land<br>  is contrary to every principle of humanity, honor, and religion, is derogatory<br>  to the character of our country abroad, and injurious to its peace and<br>  prosperity at home, and renders us obnoxious to the righteous condemnation of<br>  the Most High.<br></p><p>  And whereas more than a million of our own sex are now groaning under the yoke<br>  of an insupportable and most degrading bondage, unprotected by law, or by any<br>  sense of manly shame, from merciless stripes and cruel outrage, are subjected<br>  by a traffic in the bodies of human beings, more dreadful than<br>  <em>death,</em>  to the sudden and cruel sundering of the most sacred relations of domestic<br>  life, are deprived of knowledge, and as far as the power of their oppressors<br>  extends, of the hopes of the blessed gospel.<br></p><p>  And whereas the demoralizing influence of this atrocious system, by inducing<br>  woman to sanction and even voluntarily to practice its barbarities, often<br>  renders her even more deserving of the commiseration of Christians than when<br>  she is its involuntary victim,—sin being so much greater an evil than<br>  suffering.<br></p><p>  And whereas an enlightened and Christian public sentiment alone is, under God,<br>  likely to abolish this atrocious and complicated system of iniquity, to arrest<br>  from our country the impending judgments of the Almighty.<br></p><p>  And whereas, female influence is calculated to effect great good in such a<br>  cause, as has been abundantly shown in the abolition of British Colonial<br>  Slavery.<br></p><p>  We therefore, in behalf of ‘the suffering and the dumb,’ desiring to exercise<br>  towards both the oppressor and the oppressed the spirit of Christian<br>  benevolence, and imploring the Father of all mercies for his guidance and aid,<br>  in our efforts to subserve his will in this most holy cause, do agree to form<br>  ourselves into a Society to be governed by the following<br></p><p>CONSTITUTION.</p><p>  1.This Society shall be called the Female Anti-Slavery Society of Brooklyn and<br>  its vicinity.<br></p><p>  2.The objects of this Society shall be, First, to aid in the diffusion of<br>  information on the subject of Slavery; to portray its true character; to prove<br>  its utter indefensibleness on any principle of religion, justice or<br>  expediency. Second, to promote the elevation of the colored people of our<br>  country to the equal enjoyment with ourselves of these rights and privileges<br>  which are acknowledged to be inalienable, as the birthright of man.
