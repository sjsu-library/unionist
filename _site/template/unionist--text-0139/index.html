    <h4>Commentary</h4>
      <p>In reading the text of the actual Black Law carefully, one can observe that Judson and his allies substituted psychological coercion (sec. 3) for corporeal punishment (sec. 4). They did this knowing that any young free Black person would be under intense pressure to obey legal authority. While it was a standard practice for newspapers to republish legislative acts, what Charles Burleigh did here was place the Black Law, by which Crandall and the Canterbury Female Academy were being prosecuted, in the midst of the 'normal' legislative activities. </p>
