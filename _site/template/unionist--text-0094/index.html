    <p align="right">FOR THE UNIONIST.</p><p>  “Philosophy, though eagle-eyed in nature’s tendencies” has not succeeded in<br>  drawing a line of discrimination between the members of the human family, so<br>  marked as to proscribe from the commonwealth of humanity those who Cowper says<br>  are “guilty of a skin not colored like his own.” Indeed if my complexion does<br>  afford proof that I am not so nobly born, not endowed with the same<br>  unalienable privileges and rights as those of a different color, I declare<br>  that I am not ambitious of attaining their prerogatives, by changing skins<br>  with any of them—and much less do I repine at the decrees of Him who has made<br>  of one blood all the nations of the earth.<br></p><p>  Though in the New-England States color is not deemed a sufficient offence to<br>  consign the limbs of the tawny inhabitant to the shackle, and his back to the<br>  scourge, yet the prejudices of the South are not wholly unfelt in the North;<br>  although the fetter falls from the limb of the African, when his foot touches<br>  the New England soil, still there lingers about the heart of a yankee some of<br>  that bitterness and contempt towards his colored brethren, which forged<br>  galling chains for that oppressed race.<br></p><p>  Many specious arguments have been advanced to prove the justness of African<br>  Slavery, and although many honest men have met and refuted them, others have<br>  allowed themselves to be wheedled into the comfortable idea, that they are<br>  made of better clay, and entitled to more consideration, than their degraded<br>  sufferers. Let me call upon<br>  <em>you</em>  , who have still a small proportion of humanity left in your bosoms, to start<br>  from the siren flaterers, who would lull you to repose, while thousand of your<br>  fellow creatures groan beneath the lash of unfeeling tyrants, under the flag<br>  of a nation professing to be guided by the law of Liberty, and Equal Rights!<br>  Have you not professed to the world, that “ALL MEN ARE BORN FREE AND EQUAL.”<br>  Is not this mockery? Are not these very letters shaded by the crimson blood of<br>  your suffering brethren? Or<br>  <em>are not</em>  Africans men? Tyrant, does not your bleeding slave while kneeling to you for<br>  mercy, address you in the language of human nature—and do not<br>  <em>you</em>  prove yourself incapable of appreciating that language? ‘Tis<br>  <em>you</em>  who seem less than a man, and most devoid of every principle, every attribute<br>  of humanity.<br></p><p>  One miserable refuge, behind which the slave-holder retreats, is this; that<br>  many slaves are very well satisfied with their situation and would not wish to<br>  change it!” Very fine indeed! Because you have reduced them to this abject<br>  dependence, and perverted all the noble independence of their nature, you have<br>  a right to trample upon their undeniable rights, and continue the iniquitous<br>  business! Because a blind man loves the taste of arsenic, (being ignorant of<br>  its deadly tendency) you will thrust it down his throat! From what must that<br>  contentedness arise, which induces the slave to embrace the scourge and hub<br>  the fetter. Would<br>  <em>you</em>  be content to drudge for a master, and crouch at his feet like a dog? You say<br>  “death before slavery,” and you would despise a white man who would submit to<br>  the degradation of unlimited subordination. Because a wretch who is weary of<br>  life requests you to shoot him, would you be justified in blowing his brains<br>  out with a pistol? Answer these questions ye advocates for slavery, and if<br>  “custom has not steeled your hearts” to every principle of rectitude, you will<br>  see that mercy to a negro entitles you to no praise, since he has the same<br>  claim to liberty and respect as a European.<br></p><p align="right">CATO.</p>
