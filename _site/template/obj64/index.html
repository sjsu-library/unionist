    <p align="center">MODERN CATECHISM,</p><p align="center"><em>Adapted to the Times.</em></p><p>  Question. Who is the<br>  <em>oldest man?</em></p><p>  Answer. The<br>  <em>lad of fourteen,</em>  who struts, and swaggers, and smokes his cigar, and drinks rum; treads on the<br>  toes of his grandfather, swears at his mother and sisters, and vows that he<br>  will run away and leave “the old man,” if he will not let him have more cash.<br></p><p>Q. In what families is there the best government?</p><p>A. Those in which the children govern the parents.</p><p>Q. Who is the promptest pay-master?</p><p>A. He that deals in promises and is always ready to pay “next week.”</p><p>Q. Who is the man of business?</p><p>A. He that can carry off the most run without staggering.</p><p>Q. Who is the most regular in his habits?</p><p>  A. He that never takes spirits, except to make him “feel better, is punctual<br>  to observe eleven o’clock and four o’clock, and never eats his breakfast<br>  before he has had his “bitters.”<br></p><p>Q. Who brings up his children in the way they “should go?”</p><p>  A. He that teaches them to spend money without earning it; mixes sling,<br>  whenever he thinks it will do him good, and always saves the bottom of the<br>  glass for little Frank.<br></p><p>Q. Who is the most independent man?</p><p>  A. He that “can leave off drinking when he has a mind to,” without singing a<br>  pledge, or becoming&nbsp; a member of “the cold water society;” and, like<br>  every confirmed drunkard,—who, by the way, was once nothing more than a<br>  temperate drinker,—“does not intend to leave off till he gets ready.”<br></p><p>  Q. Who is always ready to profit by the pious example of professors of<br>  religion?<br></p><p>  A. He who appeals to Dea. W’s testimony that a little rum is<br>  <em>necessary</em>  “in certain cases,” and then goes and gets his jug filled upon<br>  <em>credit,</em>  at the store of the Deacon’s son, who trades in rum, upon his father’s<br>  capital.<br></p><p>Q. Who is treated with the most apparent respect?</p><p>A. He that most deserves to be hanged.</p><p>Q. Who is the greatest bigot?</p><p>  A. He that will neither sell his conscience, nor barter away his principles.<br></p><p>Q. Who is the most liberal man, and the most worthy of public confidence?</p><p>  A. He that has neither conscience to sell, nor principles to barter away, but<br>  always floats with the tide of popular favor.<br></p><p>Q. Who is the most prudent man?</p><p>  A. He that never engages in a work of reform until public sentiment leads the<br>  way; and never expresses an opinion, on any subject, until he learns how it<br>  will affect his popularity.<br></p><p>Q. Who is the most active and judicious reformer?</p><p>  A. He that is most vociferous in preaching against<br>  <em>intemperance,</em>  applauds, at every corner, the progress of temperance, and, passing directly<br>  by a temperance store, goes half a mile down the street, to trade with one who<br>  <em>sells ‘grog.’</em></p><p>  Q. For whom should professors of religion vote, when they go to the polls?<br></p><p>  A. Always for the man who is of<br>  <em>“their party,”</em>  though he be an<br>  <em>infidel</em>  and a<br>  <em>libertine.</em></p><p>Q. Who is the most likely to pay his debts?</p><p>  A. He that spends his estate for rum, and stands ready to go to jail, at once<br>  to satisfy all his creditors.<br></p><p>Q. Who is the greatest lawyer and politician?</p><p>  A. He that meets his pot-companions in a bar-room or grog-shop, and has taken<br>  his second glass. He then surpasses in wisdom and sage remark, a Coke or a<br>  Blackstone; and,&nbsp; in the discussion of State rights, qualifications of<br>  great men, or the grand principles of the Constitution, an Adams or a Webster<br>  is a more fool in comparison.<br></p><p>  Q. Who are the most acute in ethics and theology, and the best judges of<br>  preaching?<br></p><p>  A. A bar-room club, who have taken frequent potations, and are ready to<br>  criticize the most profound theology extant, &amp; to sit in judgment upon the<br>  most learned and eminent divines of the age.<br></p><p>Q. Who is the most accomplished young lady. [sic]</p><p>  A. The Miss who has just entered her teens, has spent six weeks in a boarding<br>  school, seen the last Waverly novel, and, perhaps, to add to her volubility,<br>  has acquired a gibbering of French; can prate in the common-place nonsense of<br>  the village, has learnt to pass unmeaning compliments, and prides herself in<br>  feeling above every honorable and useful employment.<br></p><p>Q. How far can a catechism, “adapted to the times,” be continued?</p><p>  A.<br>  <em>    Indefinitely.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>    Gen. of Tem.<br>  </em></p>
