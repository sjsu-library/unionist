    <p>  Mr. Editor,—I have just received the following invaluable communication from  Hon. Wm. Jay, of Bedford, Westchester, Co. N. Y. a man of the highest  respectability. Unfortunately it was not mailed until three days after it was  written; else it might have reached this place in time for the late trial of  Miss Crandall,—and who knows but the opinions of such men as Clinton, and  King, and Van Vechten, and Kent, and Jay might have shaken even Judge  Daggett’s confidence in his own opinion, respecting the citizenship of colored  people?</p><p>  Being, as I am, fully persuaded, that  <strong>    the learned Judge has given his sanction to an erroneous notion, that may do    inconceivable mischief in our country, if it be not corrected  </strong>  . [this turned out to be all too true] I am most happy in being able to lay  before the community in connection with his, the opinions of men who have held  the highest rank at the Bar, on the Bench, in the Halls of Legislation, and in  the Executive department of the States. Yours truly, Samuel J. May</p><p>--</p><p>  Bedford, 30  <sup>th</sup>  Sept. 1833</p><p>  <em>Rev. Sir.</em>  —On the late trial of Miss Crandall, it was thought expedient by her opponents  to attempt to deprive our whole free colored population, of the protection of  the Constitution of the United States, by denying that they were  <em>citizens.</em>  Should a second trial be had, it is possible that the annexed authorities may  be of some use and I will therefore commit them to your care, as I have not  the honor of being acquainted with Miss Crandall’s counsel.</p><p>  With sincere respect for your exertions in the cause of humanity and freedom,  I remain Rev. Sir&nbsp; Your very ob’t servant, WILLIAM JAY</p><p>--</p><p>  Extracts from ‘Reports of the proceedings and debates of the Convention of  1821 assembled for the purpose of amending the Constitution of the State of  New-Yor.’ By N.S. Carter and W.L. Stone.</p><p>  On a motion to insert the word ‘white’ before the words ‘male citizens’ in the  article of the Constitution regulating the right of suffrage.</p><p>  ‘I would submit to the consideration of the committee whether the proposition  is consistent with the constitution of the U. States. That instrument provides  that ‘Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all the privileges and  immunities of citizens in the several States.’ No longer ago than last  November, the Legislature of this State almost unanimously resolved that ‘If  the provisions contained in any proposed constitution of a new State, deny to  <em>any citizens</em>  of the existing States, the privileges and immunities of citizens of such new  State, that such proposed constitution should not be accepted or confirmed,  the same in the opinion of this Legislature being void by the Constitution of  the United States.’ Now Sir, is not the right of suffrage a privilege? Can you  deny it to a citizen of Pennsylvania who comes here and complies with your  laws, merely because he is not six feet high or because he is of a dark  complexion.’ —Speech of Peter A. Jay, p. 184</p><p>  ‘No longer ago than last winter the Legislature of this State almost  unanimously resolved ‘that their Senators be instructed and their  Representatives requested to prevent any State from being admitted into this  Union which should have incorporated into her constitution any provision  denying to the  <em>citizens</em>  of each State all the rights, privileges and immunities of citizens of the  several states.’ These instructions and requests it is well known,  particularly referred to Missouri, and were founded on a clause in her  constitution interdicting  <em>this very class of people</em>  ‘from coming to or settling in that state under any pretext whatever.”—  <em>Speech of R. Clark, p. 189</em></p><p>  ‘Suppose a  <em>negro</em>  owning a freehold, and entitled to a vote in Vermont, removes to this State,  can we constitutionally exclude him from the privileges of voting? The  constitution of the United States provides that  <em>citizens</em>  of each State shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of  citizens of the several states.’—  <em>Speech of James Kent, (the Chancellor,) p.</em>  190</p><p>  ‘The constitution of the United States is beyond the control of any act of any  of the States. It is a compact to which the people of this in common with  those of other States are parties, and cannot recede from it, without the  consent of all. With this understanding, what let me ask, is the meaning of  the provision quoted by the gentleman from Albany (Mr. Kent.) Take the fact  that a  <em>citizen of color</em>  entitled to all the privileges of a citizen, comes here—he purchases a  freehold—can you deny him the rights of an elector incident to his freehold?  He is entitled to vote because like any  <em>other</em>  citizen he is a freeholder, and every freeholder your laws entitled to vote.  He comes here, he purchases property, he pays your taxes, conforms to your  laws—how can you then under the article of the constitution of the U. States  which has been read exclude him? The gentleman from N. York thinks that the  meaning of this provision in the U.S. Constitution extends only to civil  rights. Such is not the text, it is  <em>all</em>  rights. This seems to me to lay an insuperable barrier in our way.  <em>    As certainly as the children of any white men are citizens, so    certainly&nbsp; the children of black men are citizens.’—Speech of Rufus    King, p.  </em>  192.</p><p>  ‘It seems to me that some gentlemen entertain doubts whether any of our people  of color are in a legal sense citizens; but these doubts are unfounded. We are  precluded from denying their citizenship by our uniform recognition for more  than forty years—nay some of them were citizens when this State came into  political existence—partook in our struggle for freedom and independence, and  were incorporated into the body politic at its creation. There is another and  to my mind an insuperable objection to the exclusion of free citizens of color  from the right of suffrage, arising from the provision of the Constitution of  the U.S. that the citizens of each State shall be entitled to all the  privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States.’—  <em>Speech of Abraham Van Vechten, p.</em>  193.</p><p>Letter from De Witt Clinton, Governor of N. York to President Adams.</p><p align="right">  ALBANY, 4  <sup>th</sup>  Sept. 1826</p><p>  Sir,—I have the honor to enclose copies of the proceedings of a&nbsp;  respectable meeting in West Chester County in the State, and of an Affidavit  of John Owen, by which it appears that one Gilbert Horton, a free man of color  <em>and a citizen of this State</em>  is unlawfully imprisoned in the jail of the city of Washington, and is  advertised to be sold by the Marshal of the District of Columbia. From  whatever authority a law authorizing such proceedings may have emanated,  whether from the municipality of Washington, the Legislature of Maryland, or  the Congress of the United Sates, it is at least void and unconstitutional in  its application to a  <em>citizen,</em>  and could never have intended to extend further than to fugitive slaves. As  the District of Columbia is under the exclusive control of the National  Government I conceive it my duty to apply to you for the liberation of Gilbert  Horton as a freeman,  <em>and a citizen,</em>  and feel persuaded that this request will be followed by immediate relief.</p><p>I have the honor to be &amp;c. DE WITT CLINTON.”</p>
