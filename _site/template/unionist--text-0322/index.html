    THE QUESTION SETTLED.----The Windham County Advertiser, (the determined opponent<br>of Miss Crandall,) in speaking of the late trial of Mr. Olney, says—It “was a<br>patient examination of facts, and<br><em>all who heard it admit that the fire was communicated by design.”</em>Very well. This settles one point, and we may say the only point in which the<br>American public at large, have any particular interest: and we will add, that on<br>that point, there is a most intense interest felt throughout the country. It is<br>simply this—Whether the house of Miss Crandall took fire by accident, or whether<br>it was fired by some person or persons, determined to<br><em>“break up”</em>the school. As to the miserable attempt to cast suspicion upon the friends of<br>the school, it will be an utter failure. Nobody of sound mind and principles<br>will listen to it. It is out of the question. Miss Crandall and her sister and<br>pupils are too well known, and too<br><em>favorably and honorably</em>known throughout the land, to be made objects of suspicion. A similar remark<br>might be made respecting Mr. Olney, who is well known in this city, and whose<br>character is as unimpeachable and well established as Judge Eaton’s. Besides, he<br>stands acquitted and “all” who heard the evidence, “admit that the fire was<br>communicated BY DESIGN!!!<br><em>This settles the question forever,</em>before the impartial jury of the American public, who will of necessity infer<br><em>that</em>&nbsp;the fire was communicated by the same class of persons who pelted the<br>house with stones and addled eggs, who filled the well with filth, and<br>threatened to “break up the school.” For the honor of human nature, and<br>especially of Windham county, (the land of our boyhood,) we had hoped that there<br>would remain some ground for the opinion that the fire was<br><em>accidental.</em>We are sorry to learn, and from the source least likely to admit it, that such<br>is not the fact. One question, however, of minor importance still remains to be<br>settled, and that is<br><em>which</em>of all the persons in high life and in low, that have so virulently opposed the<br>school of Miss Crandall, have been guilty of this base act? This question, which<br>it concerns the decent and respectable portion of those opponents, chiefly to<br>settle, is a question to which it would seem that the (fortunately for<br>themselves,) possess no unmeaning clue. One of their members (the editor of the<br>Advertiser) appears to have been favored, some time before hand, with intimation<br>of the fact, that an attempt would be made to “break up the school.” Let him<br>frankly reveal the source of his information, and let these informants be<br>required to name<br><em>their</em>informants, and so on, and there is little doubt that those villains will be<br>detected, and all honest men exculpated, at a cheaper rate than the adoption of<br>useless and abortive measures to thrown suspicion on the innocent.—<br><em>Emancipator</em>

      <p>The author identifies himself as some one who grew up in Windham County. The editor of <em>The Emancipator</em> Charles Denison, is a potential candidate, having been born in New London county, but potentially having lived in Windham later. Likewise, African-American activist and theorist David Ruggles was an agent of the paper. Ruggles' style matches this enthusiastic prose,The editorial prominently highlights the Black students as "<em>favorably and honorably</em>known throughout the land" as well as Prudence and Almira Crandall, a reframing of the usual publicity that indicates either a genuinely anti-racist white writer, or a Black writer whose position within the community would have made the students' respectability obvious to him.<br></p>
