Mr Hatch, on the 6<br>  <sup>th</sup>  ballot.<br></p><p>  The Senate then proceeded to the order of the day, and resumed the<br>  consideration of Mr Sprague’s resolution to alter the mode of electing their<br>  Standing Committees by the Senate, instead of being as formerly appointed by<br>  the President<br>  <em>pro tem.</em></p><p align="center">HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES</p><p align="right">TUESDAY, December 10.</p><p>  On motion of Mr McDuffie, the Report of the Secretary on the removal of the<br>  deposites [sic], was taken up and referred to the Committee of the Whole on<br>  the state of the Union.<br></p><p>  Mr Pinckney, of South Carolina, rose and stated that he held in his hand<br>  certain resolutions which he would respectfully ask leave to offer for<br>  adoption by the House. He believed that it had always been customary for the<br>  House to adopt suitable tributes of respect to its deceased members. The S.C.<br>  delegation had heard, with deep regret, of the death of their colleague, the<br>  Hon. Thomas D. Singleton, and it was his painful duty to communicate that<br>  mournful information to the House. He died at Raleigh, whilst on his journey<br>  to the Capitol, whither he was hastening to assume his seat, and to discharge<br>  his duties, as a member of this body. ****<br></p><p>  With these few remarks, which he had felt it his duty to submit, in justice to<br>  the character of one whose memory deserved a far better tribute than any he<br>  could offer, he now proposed the following resolutions for the consideration<br>  of the House;<br></p><p>  Resolved, That we have received, with deep regret, the melancholy intelligence<br>  of the death of the Hon. THO’S D. SINGLETON, a Representative elect from the<br>  State of South Carolina.<br></p><p>  Resolved, That this House tender the expression of their sympathy to the<br>  relatives of the deceased, upon this mournful event; and that, in testimony of<br>  their regret for the loss, and respect for his memory, the members will wear<br>  crape upon the left arm for thirty days.<br></p><p>The House then adjourned.</p><p>IN SENATE</p><p>THURSDAY, December 12.</p><p>  A Message from the President was received by the hands of Mr Donalson, his Private Secretary, which was read as follows:<br></p><p>  I have attentively considered the resolution of the Senate of the 11th<br>  instant, requesting the President of the United States to communicate to the<br>  Senate "a copy of the paper which has been published, and which purports to<br>  have been read by him to the heads of the Executive Departments, dated the<br>  18th day of September last, relating to the removal of the deposits of the<br>  public money from the Bank of the United States and its offices."<br>  <br />  The executive is a co-ordinate and independent branch of the Government<br>  equally with the Senate, and I have yet to learn under what constitutional<br>  authority that branch of the Legislature has a right to require of me an<br>  account of any communication, either verbally or in writing, made to the heads<br>  of Departments acting as a Cabinet council. As well might I be required to<br>  detail to the Senate the free and private conversations I have held with those<br>  officers on any subject relating to their duties and my own.<br>  <br />  Feeling my responsibility to the American people, I am willing upon all<br>  occasions to explain to them the grounds of my conduct, and I am willing upon<br>  all proper occasions to give to either branch of the Legislature any<br>  information in my possession that can be useful in the execution of the<br>  appropriate duties confided to them.<br>  <br />  Knowing the constitutional rights of the Senate, I shall be the last man under<br>  any circumstances to interfere with them. Knowing those of the Executive, I<br>  shall at all times endeavor to maintain them agreeably to the provisions of<br>  the Constitution and the solemn oath I have taken to support and defend it.<br>  <br />  I am constrained, therefore, by a proper sense of my own self-respect and of<br>  the rights secured by the Constitution to the executive branch of the<br>  Government to decline a compliance with your request. ANDREW JACKSON<br></p><p>After the message had been read,</p><p>  Mr Clay said, that a call had been made on the President for a copy of a<br>  document which has been published and extensively circulated by the papers in<br>  this city—a document intimately connected with the safety of the treasure of<br>  the country. The call for it was made under the full conviction that the Senate<br>  ought to have that document. It had been refused, under the pretext that the<br>  rights of the Chief Magistrate were invaded by it. He always would be disposed<br>  to respect the rights of every public officer, but the President could have no<br>  more confidence in his rights, then I feel in the rights of the Senate. The<br>  right of the Senate to call for this paper was founded on the ground that the<br>  whole world was already in possession of it. It was made because the document<br>  was sent forth to the American people upon an all-important subject, and<br>  because it was the right of the Senate to have it. Nor was it made because the<br>  call was in violation of precedent or an established usage. But the President<br>  has refused to give us this document, and it was not necessary to proceed<br>  further in the pursuit. One result happens from it. The President don’t deny<br>  the genuineness of the paper. It is before the world, and as we have endeavored<br>  to get it, and it has been refused, I have a right to take the next best<br>  evidence of the document, and that is as it has been published in the official<br>  paper. In every instance, therefore, where I have occasion to use it, I shall<br>  avail myself of that publication of it, as genuine.<br></p><p>  Mr Grundy said he thought when the proposition was made, that it was a very<br>  unnecessary procedure.<br></p><p>  Here the presiding office interposed that the debate was out of order unless<br>  some motion was intended to be made.<br></p><p>  Mr Grundy said he intended to love, before he concluded, that the message be<br>  laid on the table; and then resumed—<br></p><p>  That he thought it unnecessary, because we only wanted evidence when facts had<br>  not come to our knowledge, or when they are denied.—Now, he believed that both<br>  friends and enemies admitted this document to be genuine—to be what it<br>  purported to be. He therefore had thought that nothing beneficial could result<br>  from this proposition, and this was what induced him to vote against it. The<br>  President has given his objection to complying with the call, and what is it?<br>  Why, that the Senate has asked for a private communication from the Chief<br>  Magistrate to his Cabinet. He, [Mr. G.} would never question the propriety of<br>  the motives of the Senator who wanted this information. But the President has.<br>  <em>Note: Clay was a former nominee for the office of the President</em></p><p align="center">IN SENATE.</p><p align="right">WEDNESDAY, December 11, 1833.</p><p>  Mr Bibb, pursuant to notice given, presented certain joint resolutions<br>  providing or an alteration in the Constitution of the United States, in<br>  relation to the mode of electing the President, and Vice President, and then<br>  moved to lay the same on the table and print them. Mr. B. said he felt no<br>  disposition to press the consideration of the resolutions now, and therefore<br>  moved that the second Monday in January next be assigned for taking them up,<br>  and also the resolutions offered by Mr. Benton somedays since, on the same<br>  subject, at the same time; which was agreed to.<br></p><p>  Mr Clay moved the consideration of Mr Benton’s resolution, relative to the<br>  amount of moneys in deposite [sic] at particular periods in the Bank of the<br>  United States.<br></p><p><em>Apparently a line is missing here</em></p><p>  Said that it is a matter which you have no right to interrogate him about;<br>  and his opinion is, too, that to comply with the request would be setting a<br>  dangerous precedent. He [Mr G.] was not inclined to sat any thing on the<br>  subject of the removal of the deposits, when that matter should come up for<br>  consideration. But if he did, he could not, even if he were so disposed, speak<br>  of that paper as any other than a genuine one, or deny its authenticity. He<br>  therefore moved to key the message on the table; which was agreed to.<br></p><p align="center">HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</p><p align="right">Friday, Dec, 13, 1833</p><p>  The Speaker presented to the House a memorial from Messrs. Gilpin, McElderry,<br>  and Wager, the three Government Directors of the Bank of the United State, in<br>  relation to the conduct of the Directors, and especially of the President of<br>  that institution.<br></p>

He believed that it had always been customary for the<br>  House to adopt suitable tributes of respect to its deceased members. The S.C.<br>  delegation had heard, with deep regret, of the death of their colleague, the<br>  Hon. Thomas D. Singleton, and it was his painful duty to communicate that<br>  mournful information to the House. He died at Raleigh, whilst on his journey<br>  to the Capitol, whither he was hastening to assume his seat, and to discharge<br>  his duties, as a member of this body. ****<br></p><p>  With these few remarks, which he had felt it his duty to submit, in justice to<br>  the character of one whose memory deserved a far better tribute than any he<br>  could offer, he now proposed the following resolutions for the consideration<br>  of the House;<br></p><p>  Resolved, That we have received, with deep regret, the melancholy intelligence<br>  of the death of the Hon. THO’S D. SINGLETON, a Representative elect from the<br>  State of South Carolina.<br></p><p>  Resolved, That this House tender the expression of their sympathy to the<br>  relatives of the deceased, upon this mournful event; and that, in testimony of<br>  their regret for the loss, and respect for his memory, the members will wear<br>  crape upon the left arm for thirty days.<br></p><p>The House then adjourned.</p><p>IN SENATE</p><p>THURSDAY, December 12.</p><p>  A Message from the President was received by the hands of Mr Donalson, his Private Secretary, which was read as follows:<br></p><p>  I have attentively considered the resolution of the Senate of the 11th<br>  instant, requesting the President of the United States to communicate to the<br>  Senate "a copy of the paper which has been published, and which purports to<br>  have been read by him to the heads of the Executive Departments, dated the<br>  18th day of September last, relating to the removal of the deposits of the<br>  public money from the Bank of the United States and its offices."<br>  <br />  The executive is a co-ordinate and independent branch of the Government<br>  equally with the Senate, and I have yet to learn under what constitutional<br>  authority that branch of the Legislature has a right to require of me an<br>  account of any communication, either verbally or in writing, made to the heads<br>  of Departments acting as a Cabinet council. As well might I be required to<br>  detail to the Senate the free and private conversations I have held with those<br>  officers on any subject relating to their duties and my own.<br>  <br />  Feeling my responsibility to the American people, I am willing upon all<br>  occasions to explain to them the grounds of my conduct, and I am willing upon<br>  all proper occasions to give to either branch of the Legislature any<br>  information in my possession that can be useful in the execution of the<br>  appropriate duties confided to them.<br>  <br />  Knowing the constitutional rights of the Senate, I shall be the last man under<br>  any circumstances to interfere with them. Knowing those of the Executive, I<br>  shall at all times endeavor to maintain them agreeably to the provisions of<br>  the Constitution and the solemn oath I have taken to support and defend it.<br>  <br />  I am constrained, therefore, by a proper sense of my own self-respect and of<br>  the rights secured by the Constitution to the executive branch of the<br>  Government to decline a compliance with your request. ANDREW JACKSON<br></p><p>After the message had been read,</p><p>  Mr Clay said, that a call had been made on the President for a copy of a<br>  document which has been published and extensively circulated by the papers in<br>  this city—a document intimately connected with the safety of the treasure of<br>  the country. The call for it was made under the full conviction that the Senate<br>  ought to have that document. It had been refused, under the pretext that the<br>  rights of the Chief Magistrate were invaded by it. He always would be disposed<br>  to respect the rights of every public officer, but the President could have no<br>  more confidence in his rights, then I feel in the rights of the Senate. The<br>  right of the Senate to call for this paper was founded on the ground that the<br>  whole world was already in possession of it. It was made because the document<br>  was sent forth to the American people upon an all-important subject, and<br>  because it was the right of the Senate to have it. Nor was it made because the<br>  call was in violation of precedent or an established usage. But the President<br>  has refused to give us this document, and it was not necessary to proceed<br>  further in the pursuit. One result happens from it. The President don’t deny<br>  the genuineness of the paper. It is before the world, and as we have endeavored<br>  to get it, and it has been refused, I have a right to take the next best<br>  evidence of the document, and that is as it has been published in the official<br>  paper. In every instance, therefore, where I have occasion to use it, I shall<br>  avail myself of that publication of it, as genuine.<br></p><p>  Mr Grundy said he thought when the proposition was made, that it was a very<br>  unnecessary procedure.<br></p><p>  Here the presiding office interposed that the debate was out of order unless<br>  some motion was intended to be made.<br></p><p>  Mr Grundy said he intended to love, before he concluded, that the message be<br>  laid on the table; and then resumed—<br></p><p>  That he thought it unnecessary, because we only wanted evidence when facts had<br>  not come to our knowledge, or when they are denied.—Now, he believed that both<br>  friends and enemies admitted this document to be genuine—to be what it<br>  purported to be. He therefore had thought that nothing beneficial could result<br>  from this proposition, and this was what induced him to vote against it. The<br>  President has given his objection to complying with the call, and what is it?<br>  Why, that the Senate has asked for a private communication from the Chief<br>  Magistrate to his Cabinet. He, [Mr. G.} would never question the propriety of<br>  the motives of the Senator who wanted this information. But the President has.<br>  <em>Note: Clay was a former nominee for the office of the President</em></p><p align="center">IN SENATE.</p><p align="right">WEDNESDAY, December 11, 1833.</p><p>  Mr Bibb, pursuant to notice given, presented certain joint resolutions<br>  providing or an alteration in the Constitution of the United States, in<br>  relation to the mode of electing the President, and Vice President, and then<br>  moved to lay the same on the table and print them. Mr. B. said he felt no<br>  disposition to press the consideration of the resolutions now, and therefore<br>  moved that the second Monday in January next be assigned for taking them up,<br>  and also the resolutions offered by Mr. Benton somedays since, on the same<br>  subject, at the same time; which was agreed to.<br></p><p>  Mr Clay moved the consideration of Mr Benton’s resolution, relative to the<br>  amount of moneys in deposite [sic] at particular periods in the Bank of the<br>  United States.<br></p><p><em>Apparently a line is missing here</em></p><p>  Said that it is a matter which you have no right to interrogate him about;<br>  and his opinion is, too, that to comply with the request would be setting a<br>  dangerous precedent. He [Mr G.] was not inclined to sat any thing on the<br>  subject of the removal of the deposits, when that matter should come up for<br>  consideration. But if he did, he could not, even if he were so disposed, speak<br>  of that paper as any other than a genuine one, or deny its authenticity. He<br>  therefore moved to key the message on the table; which was agreed to.<br></p><p align="center">HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</p><p align="right">Friday, Dec, 13, 1833</p><p>  The Speaker presented to the House a memorial from Messrs.
