    <p>Canterbury, CT. July 19, 1833</p><p align="center">CIRCULAR OF MESSRS ADAMS AND JUDSON.</p><p align="right">CANTERBURY, CT. July 19, 1833</p><p>  It may be due the public, as well as ourselves, and the town in which we<br>  reside, that a concise answer should be made to some of the most prominent<br>  aspersions cast upon us, and our fellow citizens, in connection with the<br>  subject of a school set up in Canterbury for “colored misses.” We had supposed<br>  that the principal facts were understood by the community, so that any<br>  exaggerated statements, false accusations, or artful insinuations, would find<br>  no resting place in the mind of any honest man. Lest it may be supposed that<br>  we acquiesce in these numerous and perverted statements, we think proper to<br>  present for consideration, a few circumstances, trusting that those who know<br>  us, will not so readily receive for truth, the assumptions of those who have<br>  so liberally bestowed so great a variety of epithets upon us.<br></p><p>  PRUDENCE CRANDALL came here with a proposition to remove her School from<br>  Plainfield to this place, and establish one here, for the instruction of Young<br>  Ladies. The citizens of Canterbury readily embraced the offer, and gave her<br>  their patronage. The School, continued from the Fall of 1831, until January or<br>  February, 1833. At that time, as we have since learned, Miss C. was proselyted<br>  to the<br>  <em>immediate Abolition</em>  faith. She started for Boston under a fictitious pretence, and saw<br>  <em>Mr. Garrison,</em>  the leader of that party. She returned home and immediately went to New York<br>  and came back, as she told us, with an engagement and under a contract, to<br>  receive into her school, twenty colored girls, with an expectation of<br>  increasing the number to the full extent of her accommodations. The dismission<br>  of her former school, and the announcement of this new project, was the first<br>  knowledge given to those who had patronized her. It was soon ascertained upon<br>  what ground the school was to be established, and what principles were to be<br>  inculcated. The levelling principles of the immediate abolitionists, had taken<br>  full possession of her mind, and it was soon made known to us,<br>  <em>who</em>  were to be the patrons of the school. When we saw Arnold Buffum, and others<br>  associated with him, assert what they denominated her rights, and when their<br>  threats were poured out upon the town, and all its inhabitants, we could<br>  anticipate the ultimate effects upon the town.<br></p><p>  We distinctly state to all who may feel an interest in this matter, that we<br>  are not opposed to the education and kind treatment of the colored people. It<br>  is not in the power of any man, in truth, to say, that we have ever<br>  ill-treated a person of color. We desire to see them free and happy. This is<br>  the universal sentiment of the inhabitants of the town, so far as we know it.<br>  Our schools admit colored children to equal privileges, and we rejoice that<br>  they do so. Those schools are all visited and are under the superintendence of<br>  proper boards, excluding all danger, from the inculcation of erroneous<br>  principles. The law now in force, makes schools for foreign blacks subject to<br>  the assent of the civil authority and select men of each town, so that it is<br>  an easy matter to have such a school now, provided that board could be<br>  satisfied that no pernicious principles are to be inculcated, and no danger<br>  could arise to the town or state. Is not this right? Why should any person<br>  desire to force upon any community, a school of any sort, against all their<br>  wishes? Have the inhabitants no right to be heard in reference to the location<br>  of such an institution among them, and more especially when they know the<br>  dangerous consequences to which such measures would tend? Are the people of<br>  this State ready to admit that the abolitionists, as they are called, are<br>  diffusing sentiments and opinions consistent with the constitution and the<br>  peace of society? Is there any individual in the State of Connecticut, who<br>  would feel willing to have such a school. Together with all the necessary<br>  evils, situated within his own town or village? The answer, will be, no. Then<br>  let the same feeling be extended to us. This is the only way to ascertain<br>  whether the town of Canterbury has done right or wrong. The distinct objection<br>  which has been made by the inhabitants of the town, to the location o this<br>  school within its limits, consists in the dangerous tendency of the principles<br>  pressed by the abolitionists wherever they go, in language peculiar to<br>  themselves.—These principles are well understood, and it would be with deep<br>  regret, that any school should be established and continued, for their<br>  advancement, in a community where our friends are compelled to reside.*<br></p><p>  The manner in which Miss C. effected the change in her school, was very<br>  objectionable, and no friend that we have met with, can furnish any<br>  justification. We know of nothing that could have been done by the town, that<br>  has not been done, to induce her to remove the school, to some place where<br>  there were no objections. She has been urged by individuals—and entreated by<br>  committees, who have waited upon her, to give up this location of her school.<br>  We have heretofore stated, and we now repeat it that we offered to take the<br>  house at the price she had contracted to pay for it, and relieve her from any<br>  loss on that account. This was declined, and then the town petitioned the<br>  General Assembly, and the law which she, with the advice of her friends, now<br>  resists, was passed. Nearly a month after the rising of the Legislature, she<br>  was notified that a suit would be commenced by the Grand Juror. At the trial,<br>  her counsel gave in a demurrer to the complaint, admitting the facts true, and<br>  submitted to the finding of the court without argument. The Court required her<br>  to give bonds of $150 to appear at the net Court, which she refused to<br>  give.—This she had a right to do, and be committed if she chose. No one will<br>  say that she could not have given the bond on the spot. But it had been agreed<br>  before hand, by those who directed her what to do, that she should go to jail.<br>  She went and staid as long as suited her purposes, less than 24 hours, and<br>  then gave the bond. Some person has put in wide circulation, the story that<br>  she was confined in the cell of Watkins the murderer. This is part of the same<br>  contrivance to “get up more excitement!” She never was confined in the<br>  “murderer’s cell.” She was lodged in the debtor’s room, where every<br>  accommodation was provided, both for her and<br>  <em>her friends,</em>  whose visits were constant. She was confined no where else. It is said in<br>  justification of this untruth, that Watkins, some of the last days of his<br>  life, was taken out of his cell to receive the clergy and his friends, in the<br>  debtor’s room, because it was more convenient. How does that accord with the<br>  statement made? Just as well might it be said by those who go into the<br>  meeting-house, where Watkins attended meeting some of his last Sabbaths, that<br>  <em>they</em>  had been in the “murderers cell.”<br></p><p>  Does any one think or believe that this school, with all its evils, should be<br>  fixed, and permanently located here, we will just ask them to consider the<br>  manner too, in which this has been pressed upon us, by foreigners or persons<br>  residing out of town and State. If they are actuated by the pure principles of<br>  benevolence, how much more of that virtue they would evince to the world, by<br>  taking the school home to the places of their own residence. What necessity is<br>  there to bring persons from New York, or Philadelphia, to Canterbury? They<br>  certainly can be educated there quite as well, and more especially if we are<br>  so much like barbarians as is pretended. We wish this to be well considered,<br>  before blame is cast upon the town of Canterbury. Is not the peace and safety<br>  of community, of consequence? It will not be understood that the town ever<br>  entertained any danger from the girls themselves, but every person must know<br>  that many others will of necessity, be drawn around this nucleus, and<br>  connected with the principles of the abolitionists, who will not say that our<br>  habitations, our persons and our peace, will be insecure? In answer to this<br>  question, we will exhibit to the public, some of the principles,—some of this<br>  christian benevolence,—some of this milk of human kindness, extended to us.<br>  During the last week, the<br>  <em>“Climax”</em>  has been circulated, and sent us from the Post office in New York, marked with<br>  double postage, when the gentleman from whose press it issued, might as well<br>  have brought it himself to us, as to others. We unequivocally say, the<br>  ”Climax” is a wanton perversion of truth.<br></p><p>  We will invite the reader to go one step further. We have received through the<br>  Post Office, from some zealous abolitionist, a tract, upon which is<br>  ingeniously written, in connection with the title of the tract, so that when<br>  taken together it reads as follows—viz:<br></p><p>“Thus saith the Lord, consider your way.</p><p>The Eternal Misery of Hell: this place is for whom?</p><p>For Judge Adams and A.T. Judson.”</p><p>  If the reader will not be wearied, one other specimen of this benevolent work,<br>  which is going on to coerce this State into these Christian measures, as they<br>  are denominated, shall also be exhibited to public view. On the 18<br>  <sup>th</sup>  inst., one of the signers of this communication had delivered to him by the<br>  Post Master, a letter mailing in Pittsburg, Penn. July 12, in the following<br>  language:<br></p><p align="right">‘Pittsburg July 10, 1833.</p><p>  “Disgraceful Scoundrel—I have just read in the Boston Advocate, that you have<br>  had a white young lady put in prison, for taking in her school some colored<br>  girls. From all that I have seen and heard of your conduct in this matter, I<br>  must say my opinion of you is this—You is (are) a poor, dirty, mean, pitiful,<br>  dastardly puppy. Hypocritical villain, a rascal of the lowest order. I cannot<br>  or will not waste any more paper with such a Hell deserving hypocrite as you<br>  is. (are.) But this much I will tell you, I will be in Canterbury in 3 weeks,<br>  and you may prepare yourself for me, for I mean to beat you under the earth,<br>  if I can lay my hands on you. If not I will take a shot at you. You poor dead<br>  dog.”<br></p><p>  “N.B. If you don't change your course of life and conduct towards that good<br>  young woman, in case I do not meet with you myself, I will hire some Irishman<br>  to mould you. It<br>  <em>shall</em>  be done if I have to [pay] five hundred dollars to have it done.”<br></p><p>  “I leave you a poor Devil. G.P.”<br></p><p>  “The name of the young lady is Miss Prudence Crandall. At the advice of a<br>  friend, [I] erase my name, as I shall be in your little Hell.”<br></p><p>  Fellow citizens, such is the temper, and such the means employed, to fasten<br>  upon this town, and its inhabitants, an institution of<br>  <em>benevolence.</em>  When it shall be fastened here, what will be the effect? We leave them to the<br>  sober judgment of reflecting men.<br></p><p>RUFUS ADAMS.</p><p>ANDREW T. JUDSON.</p><p>  *The charge implied in this sentence, is a FALSE ACCUSATION. It is also a<br>  recent one, and has never to our knowledge been publicly made before, except<br>  on the 4<br>  <sup>th</sup>  of July last, when it was met with a prompt denial of its truth.<br></p>

She has been urged by individuals—and entreated by<br>  committees, who have waited upon her, to give up this location of her school.<br>  We have heretofore stated, and we now repeat it that we offered to take the<br>  house at the price she had contracted to pay for it, and relieve her from any<br>  loss on that account. This was declined, and then the town petitioned the<br>  General Assembly, and the law which she, with the advice of her friends, now<br>  resists, was passed. Nearly a month after the rising of the Legislature, she<br>  was notified that a suit would be commenced by the Grand Juror. At the trial,<br>  her counsel gave in a demurrer to the complaint, admitting the facts true, and<br>  submitted to the finding of the court without argument. The Court required her<br>  to give bonds of $150 to appear at the net Court, which she refused to<br>  give.—This she had a right to do, and be committed if she chose. No one will<br>  say that she could not have given the bond on the spot. But it had been agreed<br>  before hand, by those who directed her what to do, that she should go to jail.<br>  She went and staid as long as suited her purposes, less than 24 hours, and<br>  then gave the bond. Some person has put in wide circulation, the story that<br>  she was confined in the cell of Watkins the murderer. This is part of the same<br>  contrivance to “get up more excitement!” She never was confined in the<br>  “murderer’s cell.” She was lodged in the debtor’s room, where every<br>  accommodation was provided, both for her and<br>  <em>her friends,</em>  whose visits were constant. She was confined no where else. It is said in<br>  justification of this untruth, that Watkins, some of the last days of his<br>  life, was taken out of his cell to receive the clergy and his friends, in the<br>  debtor’s room, because it was more convenient. How does that accord with the<br>  statement made? Just as well might it be said by those who go into the<br>  meeting-house, where Watkins attended meeting some of his last Sabbaths, that<br>  <em>they</em>  had been in the “murderers cell.”<br></p><p>  Does any one think or believe that this school, with all its evils, should be<br>  fixed, and permanently located here, we will just ask them to consider the<br>  manner too, in which this has been pressed upon us, by foreigners or persons<br>  residing out of town and State. If they are actuated by the pure principles of<br>  benevolence, how much more of that virtue they would evince to the world, by<br>  taking the school home to the places of their own residence. What necessity is<br>  there to bring persons from New York, or Philadelphia, to Canterbury? They<br>  certainly can be educated there quite as well, and more especially if we are<br>  so much like barbarians as is pretended. We wish this to be well considered,<br>  before blame is cast upon the town of Canterbury. Is not the peace and safety<br>  of community, of consequence? It will not be understood that the town ever<br>  entertained any danger from the girls themselves, but every person must know<br>  that many others will of necessity, be drawn around this nucleus, and<br>  connected with the principles of the abolitionists, who will not say that our<br>  habitations, our persons and our peace, will be insecure? In answer to this<br>  question, we will exhibit to the public, some of the principles,—some of this<br>  christian benevolence,—some of this milk of human kindness, extended to us.<br>  During the last week, the<br>  <em>“Climax”</em>  has been circulated, and sent us from the Post office in New York, marked with<br>  double postage, when the gentleman from whose press it issued, might as well<br>  have brought it himself to us, as to others. We unequivocally say, the<br>  ”Climax” is a wanton perversion of truth.<br></p><p>  We will invite the reader to go one step further. We have received through the<br>  Post Office, from some zealous abolitionist, a tract, upon which is<br>  ingeniously written, in connection with the title of the tract, so that when<br>  taken together it reads as follows—viz:<br></p><p>“Thus saith the Lord, consider your way.</p><p>The Eternal Misery of Hell: this place is for whom?</p><p>For Judge Adams and A.T. Judson.”</p><p>  If the reader will not be wearied, one other specimen of this benevolent work,<br>  which is going on to coerce this State into these Christian measures, as they<br>  are denominated, shall also be exhibited to public view. On the 18<br>  <sup>th</sup>  inst., one of the signers of this communication had delivered to him by the<br>  Post Master, a letter mailing in Pittsburg, Penn. July 12, in the following<br>  language:<br></p><p align="right">‘Pittsburg July 10, 1833.</p><p>  “Disgraceful Scoundrel—I have just read in the Boston Advocate, that you have<br>  had a white young lady put in prison, for taking in her school some colored<br>  girls. From all that I have seen and heard of your conduct in this matter, I<br>  must say my opinion of you is this—You is (are) a poor, dirty, mean, pitiful,<br>  dastardly puppy. Hypocritical villain, a rascal of the lowest order. I cannot<br>  or will not waste any more paper with such a Hell deserving hypocrite as you<br>  is. (are.) But this much I will tell you, I will be in Canterbury in 3 weeks,<br>  and you may prepare yourself for me, for I mean to beat you under the earth,<br>  if I can lay my hands on you. If not I will take a shot at you. You poor dead<br>  dog.”<br></p><p>  “N.B. If you don't change your course of life and conduct towards that good<br>  young woman, in case I do not meet with you myself, I will hire some Irishman<br>  to mould you. It<br>  <em>shall</em>  be done if I have to [pay] five hundred dollars to have it done.”<br></p><p>  “I leave you a poor Devil. G.P.”<br></p><p>  “The name of the young lady is Miss Prudence Crandall. At the advice of a<br>  friend, [I] erase my name, as I shall be in your little Hell.”<br></p><p>  Fellow citizens, such is the temper, and such the means employed, to fasten<br>  upon this town, and its inhabitants, an institution of<br>  <em>benevolence.</em>  When it shall be fastened here, what will be the effect? We leave them to the<br>  sober judgment of reflecting men.<br></p><p>RUFUS ADAMS.</p><p>ANDREW T. JUDSON.</p><p>  *The charge implied in this sentence, is a FALSE ACCUSATION.
