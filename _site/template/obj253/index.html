    <p>  *The Advertiser of the 19  <sup>th</sup>  of last December contained the following article:</p><p>  <em>To all whom it may concern.</em>  —From what we can learn, we have great reason to believe that a  <em>determination</em>  has been formed to BREAK UP the  <em>negro school</em>  in Canterbury by some means or other in less than two months. We by no means  wish to encourage such a determination. And we seriously hope that our belief  is not sufficiently authorized.—The best way is to wait patiently and let the  law take its own course, and to let all doubts as to its constitutionality be  indulged to their utmost extent. The peaceable and undisturbed manner however,  in which the Instructress has of late been permitted to go on with her school,  in violation of a law which the  <em>people</em>  of this state have deliberately enacted could hardly have been expected by  her. And we have no hesitation in saying that but few towns in this or  <em>any other</em>  State, would have shown so much forbearance towards such an establishment, as  have the people of Canterbury. We were not aware until we were so informed by  our correspondent last week, that the number of the scholars now in attendance  at the abolition school was so great. We know that great efforts have been  made by its abettors,  <em>since the decision</em>  of Chief Justice Daggett, to fill up the benches of the school house, and to  increase the grievances and insults of our citizens, but we did not know until  recently that, those efforts had succeeded to the amount of “more than  <em>thirty</em>  wenches,” who are sent from all quarters of the globe!</p>
