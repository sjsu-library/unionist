This is not addressed to the world,<br>  for the world legalizes the traffic in rum, and in the bodies and souls of<br>  men. But it is addressed to the children of God, who, if they know and do<br>  their duty, can have no possible connection with either of these trades.

Yes. How is it possible? It was legal, and, at that time,<br>  honorable, and his mind was not enlightened.—Afterwards when it was he<br>  lamented his error. So there are in our country those who buy and sell their<br>  fellow beings, who, if their minds were enlightened, would lament and<br>  relinquish it.<br></p><p>  A few years ago, a man, whose whole daily earnings were required by his<br>  family, set up forty nights to run a distillery for forty dollars, which he<br>  gave to build a house of worship.—How could he think that money obtained by<br>  changing the bread of the poor, into the liquid fire of death, acceptable to<br>  God? Because his mind was in darkness. Would he do it now? No. Neither would<br>  the church now receive it. Why? Because the light of the temperance<br>  reformation has burst forth.<br></p><p>  Christians! who have promised supreme obedience to Him, that :tasted death for<br>  every man,: and more for the rich man, who, in a superb dress, rides in a<br>  superb carriage, to a superb church, to worship in superb style, than for the<br>  poor African, who pulls cotton in the “fields of Alabama, and naked as in the<br>  hour of birth, trembles under the blasts of mid winter”—on you is this call<br>  for a reformation in the church of that God, who declares himself no respector<br>  [sic] of persons.—Why do you exclude the dealer in ardent spirits from the<br>  communion table, and invite to it the dealer in human flesh? This could not,<br>  would not be, if there had been half so much effort made to show the utter<br>  abominations of christian slavery, as there has been to show the abominations<br>  of christian drunkenness. Whatever maybe the event of slavery and intemperance<br>  in the world a sufficiency of light will show, and cause to be removed<br>  these&nbsp; shocking deformities of the christian church. One denomination has<br>  already raised thousands of dollars to assist their brethren in becoming free<br>  from the deep stains of this awful sin.
