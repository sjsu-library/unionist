    <p>  We have been requested to publish the following extract from an address<br>  delivered by Doct. Wm. Hutchins, before the Windham Co. Colonization Society,<br>  at its anniversary held in this town on the 4<br>  <sup>th</sup>  of July last. The address referred to, was delivered at a time when the<br>  community was highly excited on the slavery question, and a good number of<br>  those, who professed to be abolitionists, were present and heart it. And yet<br>  no attempt was made at the time to overthrow its arguments, or to counteract<br>  its influence upon the public mind.* [Here, WLG inserts the important footnote<br>  – “This is a wilful and flagrant falsehood. The address was ably reviewed, at<br>  the time, in the columns of the Brooklyn Unionist, by its intelligent editor,<br>  Mr. Burleigh, who challenged the heathenish doctor to a public discussion.—ED.<br>  LIB.”]<br></p><p>  It is well known that<br>  <em>equality</em>  in every respect, between our white and black population, is a prominent<br>  feature in the abolition creed. For a time, but very few of the abolitionists<br>  themselves, were willing to advocate this doctrine in public, but they do not<br>  hesitate to do it now, on all occasions. If, therefore, any member of that<br>  association is disposed to answer this extract in a<br>  <em>direct</em>  and<br>  <em>explicit</em>  manner, he shall have an opportunity to do so in the columns of this paper.<br></p><p>[actual speech follows]</p><p>  But, says the abolitionist, this country is the black man’s home as much as it<br>  is yours, and you have no right to drive him from it. Granted. But is it<br>  inconsistent with benevolence to wish to better his condition by removing him?<br>  Still it is replied, our duty requires us to make this country a pleasant home<br>  to him, by removing the civil and social disabilities which now make him what<br>  he is, a poor degraded being.<br></p><p>  Let us examine this point a little. The negro, in the present state of<br>  society, is denied several political privileges. He is deprived of the right<br>  of suffrage. He is excluded from all offices of honor and profit. He is<br>  prohibited by public sentiment from practicing in the&nbsp; several<br>  professions. He is virtually shut out from many other employments, by which<br>  his white neighbor earns distinction and wealth. Now, let the law do what it<br>  can for him—let every political disability be removed,—‘tis a<br>  consummation&nbsp; devoutly to be wished—establish institutions for his moral<br>  and intellectual cultivation, and what then? The outworks are indeed forced,<br>  but the citadel remains yet impregnable. He is<br>  <em>black,</em>  and this single circumstance, I am bold to say,<br>  <em>    will always be a barrier between him and the white, which he&nbsp; cannot<br>    overleap.<br>  </em>  Educated and accomplished he may be, and protected by the whole power of the<br>  civil arm, still he<br>  <em>    is forever condemned to occupy the lowest point in the scale of social life.<br>    No form of philanthropy,<br>  </em>  no legal enactment can prevent this. There is an imperium in imperio, an<br>  empire of sentiment and fashion and opinion, an authority of nature and<br>  instinct, altogether paramount to all written law, and beyond its control. The<br>  negro, if he be allowed to vote by your side, must act with you as your equal<br>  every where else. You must meet him with a bright smile of joyous<br>  congratulation. You must extend to him all the tender charities and courtesies<br>  of social life. You must give him a seat at your table, a welcome to your<br>  fireside and to your parlor, a place beside you in your bed. You must<br>  reciprocate with him all the elegances and refinements of polished society. He<br>  must be your companion and confidential friend by day and by night, by the way<br>  side and in the field, in the drawing&nbsp; room of the affluent, as well as<br>  in the hut of the indigent. He must be&nbsp; allowed to break to you the bread<br>  of life—to prescribe to you&nbsp; in sickness, and decide in courts of justice<br>  and halls of legislation, important questions pertaining to your life, liberty<br>  and property. In all these things, there must be no constraint, but you must<br>  bind him to your heart of hearts, and most freely and unaffectedly, share with<br>  him in the delicate sympathies and fond endearments of domestic life. If<br>  fortune smiles upon him and frowns upon you, you must be content to sit at his<br>  feet and serve him. Unless you go to this full extent, you degrade him. Admit<br>  him to a moiety of these privileges, and he will but more keenly feel the loss<br>  of the remainder. The higher he goes, the more will his avidity increase, to<br>  reach the summit. Keep back a single social or civil right pertaining to<br>  entire equality, and that Mordecai in the gate will embitter all his joys, and<br>  render unavailable the blushing honors he bears so thick upon him. Such is<br>  human nature.<br></p><p>  Now, fellow citizens, need I ask, if it be possible to elevate the black man<br>  to an equality with the white? If it be, I give up the argument at once. If<br>  the negro can be treated in this country as it becometh a man, in whose face<br>  is lighted up the quenchless fire of an undying intellect, and on whose brown<br>  God has stamped the indelible signet of immortality, the colonization society,<br>  as far as respects the American negro, is laboring in a worthless cause.<br>  <em>    Take the negro home to your heart, and embrace him as your brother, and you<br>    will save our society much time and expense.<br>  </em></p><p>  Can this be done? I appeal to you not as inhabitants of Heaven or of Paradise,<br>  not as angels or glorified saints, but as imperfect men and women, tenants of<br>  this nether sphere, in which bitter is mingled with the sweet, and thorns<br>  encircle every rose. Are you willing to go all this length in relation to the<br>  black man? Can you so far conquer your antipathies as to make him your equal<br>  in the true intent and meaning of this term? ABOLITIONISTS, CAN YOU?<br></p><p>  History furnishes no instances of two distinct races of men, holding no<br>  connection by blood with each other, living together on terms of perfect<br>  equality. Turn its pages over and look through the long and gloomy annals of<br>  the past, and you cannot find a single fact of the kind. In order to equality,<br>  there must be<br>  <em>amalgamation</em>  or<br>  <em>separation.</em>  When Rome was inundated by a deluge of barbarians, the aboriginals of the<br>  country were not exterminated, but Hun, Goth, Vandal, and Roman united<br>  together, and gradually blended into the modern Italians. When Britain was<br>  overrun by a successive tide of Danes, Saxons, and Normans, the ancient<br>  inhabitants were in part driven into Wales, and in still larger proportions,<br>  became incorporated with their invaders. All past experience is opposed to the<br>  abolition doctrine of ‘prejudice vincible’ without amalgamation.<br></p><p>  Fellow citizens, take your stand. Look at the ultimate results of the<br>  immediate emancipation scheme, and let the overflowings of your benevolence be<br>  directed to a union of the two races by ties of consanguinity, or to a<br>  separation between them. If the one be revolting to reason and nature, and the<br>  other be deemed impossible, then sit down content under a state of things<br>  melancholy indeed, but remediless and desperate.<br></p>
