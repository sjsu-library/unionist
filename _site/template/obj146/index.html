    As the Unionist has requested, we have reperused our remarks upon the conductand designs of the abolitionists, and we find little to modify and nothing toretract. To the charge of severity and injustice towards the characters of theleaders in this crusade, we reply—<em>Physician heal thyselfˆ–</em>clear your own eyes of motes and films before you proceed to pull out beams fromthe eyes of others. The whole vocabulary of abuse and contumely has beenexhausted by the abolitionists in their attempts to defame the motives andblacken the characters of the members of the Colonization society—so that now wescarcely see aught else in the columns of the Liberator and Emancipator, butnumerous repetitions of the same false and unfounded charges. Indeed, one wouldthink, from the matter contained in those papers, that their<em>sole</em>object is to destroy the Colonization society; as if that being accomplished,every thing else was easy. Now let the merits of abolitionism be ten times whatits warmest abettors assert, no reasonable objection can be made to theColonization Society whatever. It proposes to transport free blacks to Africawith their own consent, and if the blacks are willing to go, pray may not<em>free white</em>men give their money for the purpose without asking the consent of the Presidentof the Anti-Slavery Society? Where was the kindness and charity of Garrison, yeamore, where was his regard for moral probity, when he said that his object ingoing to England was to raise funds for the establishment of a manual laborschool—and now, since his return, he acknowledges that he was induced to thevoyage by a desire to represent (misrepresent he should have said) the objectand designs of the Colonization Society to the English. That he slandered hiscountrymen in London, there is abundant proof. Since he returned, he deniesit—so that no less than four falsehoods lie at his door, without the possibilityof any good accruing from either. How much was there “of the law of kindness aswell as of the requisitions of justice” in the latter which the patron of theUnionist wrote to some students, and which he requested might be published; whenhe said that he looked upon the Colonization Society<em>in no other light than an emissary of Satan</em>—whose only object is to perpetuate slavery? And who have been more frequentlyaccused of falsehood and misrepresentation than Rev. Mr. Gurley and Mr. Finley?We do not ask these questions to justify ourselves if we have done wrong, butmerely to, let our “brother” see that it ill becomes him to throw stones. Tillhe &amp; his sect are free from sin they should be slow in condemning others. Asto what we asserted concerning the leaders in the abolition enterprize, we deemit strictly true. When they are told that the constitution forbids the freestates from meddling with property at the south, they reply in the language ofthe Apostle to the Jewish Ruler—we must obey God and not man—thus assertingtheir independence of the laws under which we live. If they respect the laws,why does not Miss Crandall dismiss her school? Till the decision of Judge Daggetis over ruled, that decision is the law of the land, which every honest citizenis bound to respect—and yet we see the Genius of Temperance, (the Editors ofwhich call themselves Christians par excellence) encouraging her to continue inopposition to a decree of one of the highest tribunals in the state. We find theabolitionists endeavoring to cast contempt upon the Colonization Society,because the latter speak of what is expedient to be done, in opposition to thedesigns of the&nbsp; former—and meeting in the&nbsp; writings of a gentleman oftalents and learning, a quotation about&nbsp; expediency being “a wrap-rascal,”they have rung the charges upon it, till it has fairly become stale, notforgetting in the excess of their charity to insinuate that whoever may doubt ofthe expediency of a measure, there can be no question as to the character whichsuch person&nbsp; should sustain in their own immaculate conceptions. Did theseover scrupulous gentlemen every hear or read of one who said that “all thingsare lawful for me, but all things are not expedient.” In the present state ofthe country immediate and unconditional abolition is neither<em>expedient</em>nor<em>lawful</em>—and those engaged in promoting it are only planting the seeds of sedition. Letthem beware that in sowing the wind, the do not reap the whirlwind.
