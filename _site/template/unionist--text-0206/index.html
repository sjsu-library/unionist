    <h4>Commentary</h4>
      <p>Charles Backus Storrs (1794-1833) was the first President of Case-Western Reserve University in Cleveland. This poem can also be found on Poem Hunter: https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/to-the-memory-of-charles-b-storrs/ . In addition to the poetic memorial from Whittier, there is this account from Henry Wilson of Storrs' deathbed testimony: "Rev. Amos A. Phelps of Massachusetts earnestly supported the resolution. He referred in words of tender eulogy to the Rev. Charles B. Storrs, late president of the Western Reserve College, who had recently died at Braintree, Massachusetts. He stated that Mr. Storrs, while lying on his death-bed, requested that a pen should be placed in his hands, that he might affix his name to a declaration of antislavery principles about to be issued. "He commenced," said Mr. Phelps, “tracing his name, and had written the first word, 'Charles,' when he discovered that two of the letters had been transposed. Letting the pen fall, and turning to his brother, standing by, he exclaimed, with an energy peculiar to him: 'I can write no more: Brother, do you finish my name. Those principles are eternal truth. They cannot be shaken. I wish to give to them my dying testimony.'" Mr. Phelps expressed the opinion that the death of President Storrs had been hastened by over-exertion in delivering an address of great vigor and power of more than two hours in length, in behalf of the slave. Mr. Storrs was a gentleman of high promise and scholarship, of Christian principle and earnest philanthropy, in whose untimely death freedom lost one of its earliest and ablest champions. The touching scene at his death-bed is one among the evidences that the antislavery struggle in this country was born of a zeal and heroic devotion to principle which finds not many parallels in the world's history" (“National Antislavery Convention at Philadelphia: Organization of the American Antislavery Society,” by Henry Wilson, in <em>History of the Rise and Fall of the Slave Power in America</em>, 1872, accessed http://www.americanabolitionists.com/american-anti-slavery-society.html</p>
