    <p>  <em>The Fire at Canterbury—</em>  Mr. Frederick Olney has had his trial on the charge of having set fire to Miss  Crandall’s house; and he has been fully acquitted. We trust, not the slightest  suspicion of his guilt remains on the mind of any disinterested persons, who  heard the trial. The jury would probably have given their verdict without  leaving their seats, if they had previously chosen a foreman. But so soon as  they had retired to their room and organized, they gave a unanimous vote in  his favor. And this they might have done if they had heard only the evidence  on the part of the State—for the testimony of some of the witnesses brought  forward by the public prosecutor, went to show clearly that even if the fire  were communicated on the inside, Mr. Olney could not have done it.</p><p>  Now, therefore, that Col. Judson and his coadjutors have been permitted to  indulge their suspicions to the utmost, and to subject a perfectly innocent  man to the mortification and expense of a criminal prosecution, because he  happened to be on the  <em>inside</em>  of Miss Crandall’s house on the day of the fire, now, we seriously hope the he  and they will look diligently among those on the  <em>outside</em>  of the house for the real incendiary. No one, we trust, is willing to suspect  that the Col. or any of the respectable people in Canterbury, did the deed;  but there probably are persons in the town capable of such a crime—or some who  might do it without considering it would be a  <em>crime</em>  thus, or in any other way, to “break up” the “nigger school.” Col. Judson and  his fellow laborers against that school have done all in their power to excite  the most virulent and reckless hostility to it. We were ourselves present in  the famous town meeting on the 9  <sup>th</sup>  of March, 1833, and there we heard enough said by the Col. and his colleagues  to instigate persons of a certain character to violence against the school. It  is notorious that minor acts of violence have repeatedly been committed  against her house—and they must not wonder if those who have thrown stones and  rotten eggs and filth, with impunity if not with applause, should be  emboldened to apply even the slow match. That this or something like this was  meditated the public are compelled to believe by the article in the Advertiser  of Dec. 19  <sup>th*</sup>  —and will not all have reason to suspect that the Col. and his coadjutors and  the public prosecutor are leagued to protect the real culprit, unless they now  set about in earnest to find him, in the direction pointed out by Mr.  Holbrook? This mysterious affair ought to be cleared up. No one could rejoice  more than we should do to have it satisfactory proved, that the fire was  accidental. But there appears to be scarcely any doubt that it was the work of  an incendiary. Therefore let the felon be hunted for without further delay.  Mr. Holbrook has refused to give to the public at our request, and has even  refused to give to Miss Crandall, an explanation of his meaning in the article  to which we have so often alluded. But Col. Judson and the State’s Attorney  can doubtless elicit from him the information which has so long been called  for in vain.</p>
