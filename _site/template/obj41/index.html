    <p>Canterbury, CT. July 19, 1833</p><p align="center">CIRCULAR OF MESSRS ADAMS AND JUDSON.</p><p align="right">CANTERBURY, CT. July 19, 1833</p><p>  It may be due the public, as well as ourselves, and the town in which we  reside, that a concise answer should be made to some of the most prominent  aspersions cast upon us, and our fellow citizens, in connection with the  subject of a school set up in Canterbury for “colored misses.” We had supposed  that the principal facts were understood by the community, so that any  exaggerated statements, false accusations, or artful insinuations, would find  no resting place in the mind of any honest man. Lest it may be supposed that  we acquiesce in these numerous and perverted statements, we think proper to  present for consideration, a few circumstances, trusting that those who know  us, will not so readily receive for truth, the assumptions of those who have  so liberally bestowed so great a variety of epithets upon us.</p><p>  PRUDENCE CRANDALL came here with a proposition to remove her School from  Plainfield to this place, and establish one here, for the instruction of Young  Ladies. The citizens of Canterbury readily embraced the offer, and gave her  their patronage. The School, continued from the Fall of 1831, until January or  February, 1833. At that time, as we have since learned, Miss C. was proselyted  to the  <em>immediate Abolition</em>  faith. She started for Boston under a fictitious pretence, and saw  <em>Mr. Garrison,</em>  the leader of that party. She returned home and immediately went to New York  and came back, as she told us, with an engagement and under a contract, to  receive into her school, twenty colored girls, with an expectation of  increasing the number to the full extent of her accommodations. The dismission  of her former school, and the announcement of this new project, was the first  knowledge given to those who had patronized her. It was soon ascertained upon  what ground the school was to be established, and what principles were to be  inculcated. The levelling principles of the immediate abolitionists, had taken  full possession of her mind, and it was soon made known to us,  <em>who</em>  were to be the patrons of the school. When we saw Arnold Buffum, and others  associated with him, assert what they denominated her rights, and when their  threats were poured out upon the town, and all its inhabitants, we could  anticipate the ultimate effects upon the town.</p><p>  We distinctly state to all who may feel an interest in this matter, that we  are not opposed to the education and kind treatment of the colored people. It  is not in the power of any man, in truth, to say, that we have ever  ill-treated a person of color. We desire to see them free and happy. This is  the universal sentiment of the inhabitants of the town, so far as we know it.  Our schools admit colored children to equal privileges, and we rejoice that  they do so. Those schools are all visited and are under the superintendence of  proper boards, excluding all danger, from the inculcation of erroneous  principles. The law now in force, makes schools for foreign blacks subject to  the assent of the civil authority and select men of each town, so that it is  an easy matter to have such a school now, provided that board could be  satisfied that no pernicious principles are to be inculcated, and no danger  could arise to the town or state. Is not this right? Why should any person  desire to force upon any community, a school of any sort, against all their  wishes? Have the inhabitants no right to be heard in reference to the location  of such an institution among them, and more especially when they know the  dangerous consequences to which such measures would tend? Are the people of  this State ready to admit that the abolitionists, as they are called, are  diffusing sentiments and opinions consistent with the constitution and the  peace of society? Is there any individual in the State of Connecticut, who  would feel willing to have such a school. Together with all the necessary  evils, situated within his own town or village? The answer, will be, no. Then  let the same feeling be extended to us. This is the only way to ascertain  whether the town of Canterbury has done right or wrong. The distinct objection  which has been made by the inhabitants of the town, to the location o this  school within its limits, consists in the dangerous tendency of the principles  pressed by the abolitionists wherever they go, in language peculiar to  themselves.—These principles are well understood, and it would be with deep  regret, that any school should be established and continued, for their  advancement, in a community where our friends are compelled to reside.*</p><p>  The manner in which Miss C. effected the change in her school, was very  objectionable, and no friend that we have met with, can furnish any  justification. We know of nothing that could have been done by the town, that  has not been done, to induce her to remove the school, to some place where  there were no objections. She has been urged by individuals—and entreated by  committees, who have waited upon her, to give up this location of her school.  We have heretofore stated, and we now repeat it that we offered to take the  house at the price she had contracted to pay for it, and relieve her from any  loss on that account. This was declined, and then the town petitioned the  General Assembly, and the law which she, with the advice of her friends, now  resists, was passed. Nearly a month after the rising of the Legislature, she  was notified that a suit would be commenced by the Grand Juror. At the trial,  her counsel gave in a demurrer to the complaint, admitting the facts true, and  submitted to the finding of the court without argument. The Court required her  to give bonds of $150 to appear at the net Court, which she refused to  give.—This she had a right to do, and be committed if she chose. No one will  say that she could not have given the bond on the spot. But it had been agreed  before hand, by those who directed her what to do, that she should go to jail.  She went and staid as long as suited her purposes, less than 24 hours, and  then gave the bond. Some person has put in wide circulation, the story that  she was confined in the cell of Watkins the murderer. This is part of the same  contrivance to “get up more excitement!” She never was confined in the  “murderer’s cell.” She was lodged in the debtor’s room, where every  accommodation was provided, both for her and  <em>her friends,</em>  whose visits were constant. She was confined no where else. It is said in  justification of this untruth, that Watkins, some of the last days of his  life, was taken out of his cell to receive the clergy and his friends, in the  debtor’s room, because it was more convenient. How does that accord with the  statement made? Just as well might it be said by those who go into the  meeting-house, where Watkins attended meeting some of his last Sabbaths, that  <em>they</em>  had been in the “murderers cell.”</p><p>  Does any one think or believe that this school, with all its evils, should be  fixed, and permanently located here, we will just ask them to consider the  manner too, in which this has been pressed upon us, by foreigners or persons  residing out of town and State. If they are actuated by the pure principles of  benevolence, how much more of that virtue they would evince to the world, by  taking the school home to the places of their own residence. What necessity is  there to bring persons from New York, or Philadelphia, to Canterbury? They  certainly can be educated there quite as well, and more especially if we are  so much like barbarians as is pretended. We wish this to be well considered,  before blame is cast upon the town of Canterbury. Is not the peace and safety  of community, of consequence? It will not be understood that the town ever  entertained any danger from the girls themselves, but every person must know  that many others will of necessity, be drawn around this nucleus, and  connected with the principles of the abolitionists, who will not say that our  habitations, our persons and our peace, will be insecure? In answer to this  question, we will exhibit to the public, some of the principles,—some of this  christian benevolence,—some of this milk of human kindness, extended to us.  During the last week, the  <em>“Climax”</em>  has been circulated, and sent us from the Post office in New York, marked with  double postage, when the gentleman from whose press it issued, might as well  have brought it himself to us, as to others. We unequivocally say, the  ”Climax” is a wanton perversion of truth.</p><p>  We will invite the reader to go one step further. We have received through the  Post Office, from some zealous abolitionist, a tract, upon which is  ingeniously written, in connection with the title of the tract, so that when  taken together it reads as follows—viz:</p><p>“Thus saith the Lord, consider your way.</p><p>The Eternal Misery of Hell: this place is for whom?</p><p>For Judge Adams and A.T. Judson.”</p><p>  If the reader will not be wearied, one other specimen of this benevolent work,  which is going on to coerce this State into these Christian measures, as they  are denominated, shall also be exhibited to public view. On the 18  <sup>th</sup>  inst., one of the signers of this communication had delivered to him by the  Post Master, a letter mailing in Pittsburg, Penn. July 12, in the following  language:</p><p align="right">‘Pittsburg July 10, 1833.</p><p>  “Disgraceful Scoundrel—I have just read in the Boston Advocate, that you have  had a white young lady put in prison, for taking in her school some colored  girls. From all that I have seen and heard of your conduct in this matter, I  must say my opinion of you is this—You is (are) a poor, dirty, mean, pitiful,  dastardly puppy. Hypocritical villain, a rascal of the lowest order. I cannot  or will not waste any more paper with such a Hell deserving hypocrite as you  is. (are.) But this much I will tell you, I will be in Canterbury in 3 weeks,  and you may prepare yourself for me, for I mean to beat you under the earth,  if I can lay my hands on you. If not I will take a shot at you. You poor dead  dog.”</p><p>  “N.B. If you don't change your course of life and conduct towards that good  young woman, in case I do not meet with you myself, I will hire some Irishman  to mould you. It  <em>shall</em>  be done if I have to [pay] five hundred dollars to have it done.”</p><p>  “I leave you a poor Devil. G.P.”</p><p>  “The name of the young lady is Miss Prudence Crandall. At the advice of a  friend, [I] erase my name, as I shall be in your little Hell.”</p><p>  Fellow citizens, such is the temper, and such the means employed, to fasten  upon this town, and its inhabitants, an institution of  <em>benevolence.</em>  When it shall be fastened here, what will be the effect? We leave them to the  sober judgment of reflecting men.</p><p>RUFUS ADAMS.</p><p>ANDREW T. JUDSON.</p><p>  *The charge implied in this sentence, is a FALSE ACCUSATION. It is also a  recent one, and has never to our knowledge been publicly made before, except  on the 4  <sup>th</sup>  of July last, when it was met with a prompt denial of its truth.</p>

We have received through the  Post Office, from some zealous abolitionist, a tract, upon which is  ingeniously written, in connection with the title of the tract, so that when  taken together it reads as follows—viz:</p><p>“Thus saith the Lord, consider your way.</p><p>The Eternal Misery of Hell: this place is for whom?</p><p>For Judge Adams and A.T. Judson.”</p><p>  If the reader will not be wearied, one other specimen of this benevolent work,  which is going on to coerce this State into these Christian measures, as they  are denominated, shall also be exhibited to public view. On the 18  <sup>th</sup>  inst., one of the signers of this communication had delivered to him by the  Post Master, a letter mailing in Pittsburg, Penn. July 12, in the following  language:</p><p align="right">‘Pittsburg July 10, 1833.</p><p>  “Disgraceful Scoundrel—I have just read in the Boston Advocate, that you have  had a white young lady put in prison, for taking in her school some colored  girls. From all that I have seen and heard of your conduct in this matter, I  must say my opinion of you is this—You is (are) a poor, dirty, mean, pitiful,  dastardly puppy. Hypocritical villain, a rascal of the lowest order. I cannot  or will not waste any more paper with such a Hell deserving hypocrite as you  is. (are.) But this much I will tell you, I will be in Canterbury in 3 weeks,  and you may prepare yourself for me, for I mean to beat you under the earth,  if I can lay my hands on you. If not I will take a shot at you. You poor dead  dog.”</p><p>  “N.B. If you don't change your course of life and conduct towards that good  young woman, in case I do not meet with you myself, I will hire some Irishman  to mould you. It  <em>shall</em>  be done if I have to [pay] five hundred dollars to have it done.”</p><p>  “I leave you a poor Devil. G.P.”</p><p>  “The name of the young lady is Miss Prudence Crandall. At the advice of a  friend, [I] erase my name, as I shall be in your little Hell.”</p><p>  Fellow citizens, such is the temper, and such the means employed, to fasten  upon this town, and its inhabitants, an institution of  <em>benevolence.</em>  When it shall be fastened here, what will be the effect? We leave them to the  sober judgment of reflecting men.</p><p>RUFUS ADAMS.</p><p>ANDREW T. JUDSON.</p><p>  *The charge implied in this sentence, is a FALSE ACCUSATION. It is also a  recent one, and has never to our knowledge been publicly made before, except  on the 4  <sup>th</sup>  of July last, when it was met with a prompt denial of its truth.</p></dd>
