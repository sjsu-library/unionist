    <p>CIRCULAR</p><p><em>TO PARENTS, TEACHERS, SCHOOL COMMITTEES,</em></p><p><em>And all who feel an Interest in the Improvement of Youth.</em></p><p>  It is not yet quite a year since Parley’s Magazine was commenced. During that<br>  short period the number of subscribers has increased to 20,000, and the work<br>  has received, every where, the most unqualified approbation. It has found its<br>  way to thousands of families, and while it has entertained the social circle,<br>  its unobtrusive lessons have, we trust, often had a<br>  <em>salutary influence</em>  on the<br>  <em>juvenile mind</em>  and<br>  <em>heart.</em>  It has also found its way to the school room; and many classes of young pupils<br>  have been cheered twice a month&nbsp; y the welcome voice of their teacher<br>  bidding them to lay aside for a few days, the class book which they have read<br>  over and over, perhaps twenty times, and read the pages of Parley’s Magazine.<br>  The demand for the work, to be used in schools, is rapidly increasing.<br></p><p>  Encouraged by such unexampled success, the Publishers have resolved to render<br>  it still more worthy so liberal a patronage; and not to remit their exertions<br>  till they see it introduced into families and schools, throughout the whole<br>  length and breadth of the United States.<br></p><p>  In this view they have secured new aid in the Editorial department. The late<br>  Editor of the Juvenile Rambler, who, in addition to his qualifications as a<br>  writer for the young, has the advantage of many years experience as a teacher,<br>  will henceforth assist in conducting it.<br></p><p>  We propose to present, in the progress of each volume, a great variety of<br>  interesting and important topics, among which are the following.<br></p><p>  I.Natural History—Of beasts, birds, fishes, reptiles, insects; plants,<br>  flowers, trees; the human frame, &amp;c.<br></p><p>II.Biography—Especially of the young.</p><p>III.Geography—Accounts of places, manners, customs, etc.</p><p>IV.Travels and Voyages, in various parts of the world.</p><p>  V.Lively Descriptions of the Curiosities of<br>  <em>Nature</em>  and<br>  <em>Art—</em>  in each of the United States, and in other countries.<br></p><p>  VI.Lessons on Objects that daily surround Children in the Parlor, Nursery,<br>  Garden, etc. Accounts of Trades and Employments.<br></p><p>  VII.Particular Duties of the Young—to Parents, Teachers, Brothers, Sisters,<br>  etc.<br></p><p>VIII.Bible Lessons and Stories</p><p>IX.Narratives—Such as are well authenticated—Original Tales</p><p>  X.Parables, Fables, and Proverbs, where the moral is obvious and excellent.<br></p><p>XI.Poetry—Adapted to the Youthful capacity and feelings.</p><p>  XII.Intelligence—Embracing Accounts of Juvenile<br>  <em>Books</em>  Societies, and<br>  <em>Remarkable Occurrences.</em></p><p>  Many of these subjects will be illustrated by numerous and beautiful<br>  engravings, prepared by the best artists , and selected not only with a view<br>  to<br>  <em>adorn</em>  the work, but to improve the taste, cultivate the mind, and raise the<br>  affections of the young to appropriate and worthy objects. We would make them<br>  better brothers, better sisters, better pupils, better associates, and, in the<br>  end, better citizens.<br></p><p>  We beg the friends of education—especially parents and teachers, to view the<br>  matter in this fight. Let children look upon the pictures, not as pictures<br>  <em>merely;</em>  but let them be taught to<br>  <em>study</em>  them. What can be more rich in valuable materials for instructive lessons than<br>  a good engraving?<br></p><p>  After this brief explanation of our principles and purposes, we ask the<br>  co-operation of all who receive this Circular. Will you aid us, by your<br>  influence, in this great work—the formation of mind and character for the<br>  rising generation? Will you assist us all in your power, in our endeavors to<br>  introduce to American schools, and parlors, and firesides, the stories and<br>  lessons of Parley’s Magazine?<br></p><p>  Every single number of the new volume will have a strong paper cover,<br>  abundantly sufficient to preserve the work in good order for binding and for<br>  use in schools.<br></p><p>  The yearly subscription being but one<br>  <em>dollar</em>  , our friends will perceive the impracticability of keeping open so many<br>  thousand accounts. It is therefore indispensable that we should require<br>  payment always in advance.<br></p><p>  Two numbers more will close the first year, and we now give this notice that<br>  all who desire to continue the Magazine, may signify their intention by a<br>  seasonable advance for the second year.<br></p><p>  In any of the subscribers should not receive all their numbers, they can<br>  request the Post-Master to notify us of such as are missing, and they shall be<br>  sent again free of charge.<br></p><p>TEN COPIES FREE OF POSTAGE.</p><p>  To accommodate ASSOCIATIONS, SCHOOLS, and INDIVIDUALS, for distributions, we<br>  will deliver at any Post-Office in the United States,<br>  <em>free of postage,</em>  TEN COPIES TO ONE ADDRESS for TEN dollars remitted to us without cost.<br></p><p>LILLY, WATT, and CO., Boston</p><p></p>

    <h4>Commentary</h4>
      <p>The mixed messages about race in literature intended for schoolchildren at this time are on clear display here in a page from The Tales of Peter Parley about Africa (Philadelphia: Charles deSilver, 1859). The Dutch are still the founders of Cape Town, but they stole the land from a genial "race of tall, slender Negroes, of a very gentle temper."</p>
