    <p>LAST ILLNESS OF WM. WIRT.</p><p>  The Richmond Compiler of the 17  <sup>th</sup>  ult. contains an affecting account of the last illness of Mr. Wirt, written by  a gentleman who attended him through that illness. We proceed to extract the  principal part of it.—  <em>Free Elector</em></p><p>  “On the evening of Saturday, the 8  <sup>th</sup>  instant, he was in playful spirits, and sanguine of the success of an argument  which he was to make in court on Monday. He felt better satisfied with his  preparation, he said, than for any he had made for years before. On Sunday he  walked to the Capitol to Church—it was a damp, chilly day, and the  Representatives’ Hall was crowded and warm. To go immediately from it into the  cold, damp air, and walk slowly, as he did, a mile to his lodgings, might have  been deemed imprudent in one whose health was less precarious than his then  seemed.</p><p>  ”That night he complained of a slight indisposition, and in the family worship  of the evening prayed with an unusual fervor, and seemingly a foreboding  spirit which he communicated not save to his God. But even this was sufficient  to excite vague apprehensions in a family always ready to note and to dwell  upon whatsoever might seem to bode danger or safety to a friend so dear.</p><p>  On Monday he was confined to his room; no serious apprehensions were  entertained, but a physician was called in—it was only a cold. On Tuesday he  was worse, but we feared not the result. He complained of stiffness of the  muscles of the throat and swelling of the glands—milk poultices were applied  to his face, but they gave not relief. On Wednesday he was much worse so much  as to excite alarm; on the evening of this day it was first discovered that  the disease was Erysipelas, ”a new enemy,” of which Mr. Wirt then expressed  his fears. “It was not the foe with which he had been so long accustomed to  contend.”</p><p>  His constitution was too weak, as the physicians apprehended, to stand the  vigorous treatment which would have been most efficient in destroying the  disease. By Friday, the alarm had become very serious—the door was crowded by  anxious inquiring friends, and those who met in the street asked from each  other the latest intelligence. The affliction of the family was extreme, but  there was still hope. On Saturday, his daughter and son-in-law arrived from  Baltimore, and were shocked to find the case so much worse than their worst  fears.</p><p>  Scarcely a glimmer of hope was left to us, but this feeble ray was most  anxiously watched and cherished. When once shadowed by so deep a gloom, the  least of the twinkling stars in the firmament is more precious to our sight,  than is the sun itself in the noontide of an unclouded day.</p><p>  Death from the first day of his illness, had continued to approach with a  steady pace, and in a form more than usually hideous. The fine countenance so  bright with intellect, was sadly altered—by the disease partly, and partly by  remedies so fruitlessly applied. The eyes had lost their speculation—the  eloquent voice was hushed—the divinity had departed from the temple, and its  walls were defaced, but light still lingered, loath to abandon a habitation  which had so long given to a thing in itself so little desirable and so  worthless, beauty, purity, and worth.</p><p>  The attending physicians were Doctors Hunt and Hall; none could have been more  anxiously attentive; the latter staid by him every night of the last four or  five.</p><p>  About noon on Monday, consciousness returned; and he had power to speak a few  words. Nature had made a last effort to permit him to take leave of his family  and friends, to give them assurance that he died in christian hope, and to  join them in prayer to his God. The Rev. Mr. Post officiated. In so much of  the prayer as related to his family and his own acceptance with heaven, he  seemed heartily to join—but when a petition was offered that he might be  restored to health, he audibly dissented “no, no!” He had done and suffered  enough in this contentious world, and was entitled to the release and the  transfer to a higher existence, which the good and just are authorized to  expect.</p><p>  It was now become manifest, even to the most sanguine, that recovery was  beyond the remotest probability. He was too shining a mark for death longer to  miss. All that was left to us was to smooth his passage to the tomb—to moisten  his parched lips and tongue, and perform such little offices of affection as  might soothe his last sufferings.</p><p>  During the last eighteen hours, he was tranquil as a child. Breathing and  warmth were the only evidence of life—no motion, no pain, no consciousness,  there lay the wreck of WILLIAM WIRT.</p><p>  Three friends besides the clergymen attended his bedside during the night—his  family to, worn as they were by nearly a week’s constant watching, could not  be induced to take repose. Anguish and affection gave them strength to bear  what would have exhausted the strongest men It was a night long to be  remembered—a night of silent, despairing sorrow, which conveys to the heart a  language never to be forgot, a language which is not for a pen like mine to  transcribe.</p><p>  Tuesday morning breaks upon the scene still unaltered, save that life  fluttered more faintly and all pulse was gone. About 11 o’clock the breathing  became gradually more distant and more feeble—was suspended or  imperceptible—another breath—he’s gone! So calm, so imperceptibly did he make  his exit, that the precise moment of his departure could scarcely be  marked—without a sign or a struggle his bright spirit has departed from  amongst us to a state o existence higher, mightier, and more glorious.</p><p>  Upon a highly excited mind a slight incident will sometimes make a deep and  lasting impression. As the last flickerings of life were failing—while his  whole family, and the friends who had watched with them, were grouped around  his bed, and In silent, deep attention to the awful scene, all held their  breath, and their hearts and pulse stood still, a few soft, low notes from a  pet bird, which had before been so silent that its presence in the room was  unremarked, fell with startling sweetness on the ear. Only once before during  his illness, had it been known to sing. On the preceding day,, at the  conclusion of the last act of devotion in which he ever joined, these same  soft notes had mingled with the solemn ‘Amen.’</p><p></p>
