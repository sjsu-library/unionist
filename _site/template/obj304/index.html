    <p>LAST ILLNESS OF WM. WIRT.</p><p>  The Richmond Compiler of the 17<br>  <sup>th</sup>  ult. contains an affecting account of the last illness of Mr. Wirt, written by<br>  a gentleman who attended him through that illness. We proceed to extract the<br>  principal part of it.—<br>  <em>Free Elector</em></p><p>  “On the evening of Saturday, the 8<br>  <sup>th</sup>  instant, he was in playful spirits, and sanguine of the success of an argument<br>  which he was to make in court on Monday. He felt better satisfied with his<br>  preparation, he said, than for any he had made for years before. On Sunday he<br>  walked to the Capitol to Church—it was a damp, chilly day, and the<br>  Representatives’ Hall was crowded and warm. To go immediately from it into the<br>  cold, damp air, and walk slowly, as he did, a mile to his lodgings, might have<br>  been deemed imprudent in one whose health was less precarious than his then<br>  seemed.<br></p><p>  ”That night he complained of a slight indisposition, and in the family worship<br>  of the evening prayed with an unusual fervor, and seemingly a foreboding<br>  spirit which he communicated not save to his God. But even this was sufficient<br>  to excite vague apprehensions in a family always ready to note and to dwell<br>  upon whatsoever might seem to bode danger or safety to a friend so dear.<br></p><p>  On Monday he was confined to his room; no serious apprehensions were<br>  entertained, but a physician was called in—it was only a cold. On Tuesday he<br>  was worse, but we feared not the result. He complained of stiffness of the<br>  muscles of the throat and swelling of the glands—milk poultices were applied<br>  to his face, but they gave not relief. On Wednesday he was much worse so much<br>  as to excite alarm; on the evening of this day it was first discovered that<br>  the disease was Erysipelas, ”a new enemy,” of which Mr. Wirt then expressed<br>  his fears. “It was not the foe with which he had been so long accustomed to<br>  contend.”<br></p><p>  His constitution was too weak, as the physicians apprehended, to stand the<br>  vigorous treatment which would have been most efficient in destroying the<br>  disease. By Friday, the alarm had become very serious—the door was crowded by<br>  anxious inquiring friends, and those who met in the street asked from each<br>  other the latest intelligence. The affliction of the family was extreme, but<br>  there was still hope. On Saturday, his daughter and son-in-law arrived from<br>  Baltimore, and were shocked to find the case so much worse than their worst<br>  fears.<br></p><p>  Scarcely a glimmer of hope was left to us, but this feeble ray was most<br>  anxiously watched and cherished. When once shadowed by so deep a gloom, the<br>  least of the twinkling stars in the firmament is more precious to our sight,<br>  than is the sun itself in the noontide of an unclouded day.<br></p><p>  Death from the first day of his illness, had continued to approach with a<br>  steady pace, and in a form more than usually hideous. The fine countenance so<br>  bright with intellect, was sadly altered—by the disease partly, and partly by<br>  remedies so fruitlessly applied. The eyes had lost their speculation—the<br>  eloquent voice was hushed—the divinity had departed from the temple, and its<br>  walls were defaced, but light still lingered, loath to abandon a habitation<br>  which had so long given to a thing in itself so little desirable and so<br>  worthless, beauty, purity, and worth.<br></p><p>  The attending physicians were Doctors Hunt and Hall; none could have been more<br>  anxiously attentive; the latter staid by him every night of the last four or<br>  five.<br></p><p>  About noon on Monday, consciousness returned; and he had power to speak a few<br>  words. Nature had made a last effort to permit him to take leave of his family<br>  and friends, to give them assurance that he died in christian hope, and to<br>  join them in prayer to his God. The Rev. Mr. Post officiated. In so much of<br>  the prayer as related to his family and his own acceptance with heaven, he<br>  seemed heartily to join—but when a petition was offered that he might be<br>  restored to health, he audibly dissented “no, no!” He had done and suffered<br>  enough in this contentious world, and was entitled to the release and the<br>  transfer to a higher existence, which the good and just are authorized to<br>  expect.<br></p><p>  It was now become manifest, even to the most sanguine, that recovery was<br>  beyond the remotest probability. He was too shining a mark for death longer to<br>  miss. All that was left to us was to smooth his passage to the tomb—to moisten<br>  his parched lips and tongue, and perform such little offices of affection as<br>  might soothe his last sufferings.<br></p><p>  During the last eighteen hours, he was tranquil as a child. Breathing and<br>  warmth were the only evidence of life—no motion, no pain, no consciousness,<br>  there lay the wreck of WILLIAM WIRT.<br></p><p>  Three friends besides the clergymen attended his bedside during the night—his<br>  family to, worn as they were by nearly a week’s constant watching, could not<br>  be induced to take repose. Anguish and affection gave them strength to bear<br>  what would have exhausted the strongest men It was a night long to be<br>  remembered—a night of silent, despairing sorrow, which conveys to the heart a<br>  language never to be forgot, a language which is not for a pen like mine to<br>  transcribe.<br></p><p>  Tuesday morning breaks upon the scene still unaltered, save that life<br>  fluttered more faintly and all pulse was gone. About 11 o’clock the breathing<br>  became gradually more distant and more feeble—was suspended or<br>  imperceptible—another breath—he’s gone! So calm, so imperceptibly did he make<br>  his exit, that the precise moment of his departure could scarcely be<br>  marked—without a sign or a struggle his bright spirit has departed from<br>  amongst us to a state o existence higher, mightier, and more glorious.<br></p><p>  Upon a highly excited mind a slight incident will sometimes make a deep and<br>  lasting impression. As the last flickerings of life were failing—while his<br>  whole family, and the friends who had watched with them, were grouped around<br>  his bed, and In silent, deep attention to the awful scene, all held their<br>  breath, and their hearts and pulse stood still, a few soft, low notes from a<br>  pet bird, which had before been so silent that its presence in the room was<br>  unremarked, fell with startling sweetness on the ear. Only once before during<br>  his illness, had it been known to sing. On the preceding day,, at the<br>  conclusion of the last act of devotion in which he ever joined, these same<br>  soft notes had mingled with the solemn ‘Amen.’<br></p><p></p>
