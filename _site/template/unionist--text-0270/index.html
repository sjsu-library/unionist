    <h4>Commentary</h4>
      <p>At some point, <em>The Unionist</em> reviewed this work by Orin Fowler, as can be seen from this blurb: <p>  "Fowler on the Evils of using Tobacco.—We are anxious to see this work<br>  extensively circulated, for we are confident that it will do good. The<br>  pamphlet contains much valuable information, and will be found well worth an<br>  attentive and frequent perusal."<br></p><p align="right">  <em>The Unionist</em>  , Brooklyn, Conn.<br></p>Orin Fowler (1791-1852) is a fascinating character, with many connections to the Burleighs. For more on this pamphlet against smoking, it can be accessed online here:  https://www.gutenberg.org/files/24366/24366-h/24366-h.htm . Tim Crumrin's blog post, "Noxious Weed," places Fowler's pamphlet in context -  https://www.vchsmuseum.org/post/noxious-weed . But in addition to this prescient struggle against tobacco, Fowler was a two-term Congressman, and an anti-slavery man. In an 1850 speech on the floor of the House, he spoke these memorable words about the despicable institution: <p>  “we must know what American slavery is. A constituent element is one thing, a<br>  relation is another thing, an appendage is another. What is the intrinsic, the<br>  unchanging, the essential element of American slavery? I answer, American<br>  slavery reduces man — a man created free, and equal to all other men — it<br>  reduces him to property. It makes free, moral agents, chattels. It converts<br>  persons into things — it sinks a rational creature into merchandise. An<br>  American slave can own nothing — can acquire nothing. Slavery annuls his right<br>  to himself. If he uses these terms — my hands, my eyes, my tongue, my body, my<br>  mind, myself— they are mere figures of speech. If an American slave uses<br>  himself for his own benefit, he commits a crime. If he keeps and appropriates<br>  what he earns, he is thereby a thief. To take his own body into his own<br>  keeping, is insurrection ; and death must be his doom for the deed, if he<br>  persevere. American slavery subjects men like ourselves, to be bartered,<br>  mortgaged, bequeathed, invoiced, shipped in cargoes, stored as other goods,<br>  taken on execution, as are cattle, and knocked off at public auction. It makes<br>  a man's rights — a man's deathless nature — a man's conscience, affections,<br>  sympathies, hopes — a marketable commodity. It robs him, not of privileges,<br>  but of himself. It loads him, not with burdens, but makes him a beast of<br>  burden. It restrains not liberty — it subverts it. It does not curtail rights<br>  — it abolishes them. In a word, American slavery sinks man into a machine —<br>  annihilates personality — despoils a human being of rational attributes —<br>  unmans a man. Such is American slavery."<br></p><p>Orin Fowler, <em>  Slavery in California and New Mexico: speech of Mr. Orin Fowler, of<br>  Massachusetts, in the House of Representatives, March 11, 1850 ...<br></em>&nbsp;[Washington, D.C.]: Buell &amp; Blanchard, 1850.</p> <p>The direct connection to the Burleighs comes much earlier in his career than this, though.  Fowler was a member of the Windham County Peace Society (Larned, Vol. II, p. 391), and when Fowler served at the Congregational Church in Plainfield, Rinaldo Burleigh (father of Charles and William) served as Deacon under him (Larned, Vol. II, p. 418) <br><br><br><br></p>
