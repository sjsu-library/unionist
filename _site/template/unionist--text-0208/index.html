    <p align="center">  SIXTH REPORT OF THE AMERICAN<br>  <strong>TEMPERANCE SOCIETY</strong>  ,<br></p><p align="center"><em>Continued</em></p><p>  IV. Laws which authorize the licensing of men to traffic in ardent spirit,<br>  violate the first principles of political economy, and are highly injurious to<br>  the wealth of a nation.<br></p><p>  The wealth of a nation consists of the wealth of all the individuals that<br>  compose it. The sources of wealth are labor, land, and capital. The last is<br>  indeed the product of the two former; but as it may be used to increase their<br>  value, it is considered by writers on political economy, as one of the<br>  original sources of national wealth. Whatever lessons either of these, or<br>  their productiveness when employed upon each other, lessens the wealth of the<br>  country. Capital may be employed in two ways; either to produce new capital,<br>  or merely to afford gratification, and in the production of that gratification<br>  he consumed, without repealing its value. The first may be called capital, and<br>  the last expenditure. These will of course bear inverse proportions to each<br>  other. If the first be large, the last must be small, and vice versa. Without<br>  any change of the amount of wealth, capital will be increased by the lessened<br>  by the increase of expenditure. Although the manner of dividing makes no<br>  difference with the present amount of national wealth, it makes great<br>  difference with the future amount; as it alters materially the sources of<br>  producing it, the means of an equal, or increased reproduction.<br></p><p>  For instance, a man fond of noise and excited agreeably by the hearing of it,<br>  pays a dollar for gunpowder, and touches fire to it. He occasions an entire<br>  loss of that amount of property. Although the powder maker and the merchant,<br>  may both have received their pay, if it has not benefitted the man, to him it<br>  has been a total loss; and if the sale of it was more profitable than would<br>  have been the sale of some useful article, it has been an entire loss to the<br>  community. And if by the explosion the man is burnt, partially loses his<br>  reason, is taken off a time from business, and confined by sickness to his<br>  bed, must have nurses, physicians, &amp;c. the loss is still increased. And if<br>  he never recovers fully his health, or reason, suffers his social affections<br>  and moral sensibility, becomes less faithful in the education of his children,<br>  and they are more exposed to temptation and ruin, and he is never again as<br>  able or willing to be habitually employed in productive labor, the nation<br>  loses equal to the amount of all these put together. And if his example leads<br>  other men to spend, and to suffer in the same way, the loss is still farther<br>  increased; and so on, through all its effects.<br></p><p>  And even though the powder maker and the merchant have made enormous profit,<br>  this does not prevent the loss to the community; any more than the profit of<br>  lottery gamblers, or counterfeiters of the public coin, prevents loss to the<br>  community. Nor does it meet the case, to say that the property changes hands.<br>  This is not true. The man who sold the powder made a profit of only a part<br>  even of the money which the other man paid for it; while he lost not only the<br>  whole, but vastly more. The whole of the original cost was only a small part<br>  of the loss to the buyer, and for the nation. The merchant gained nothing of<br>  the time, and other numerous expenses, which the buyer lost; nor does he in<br>  any way remunerate the community for that loss.<br></p><p>  Suppose that man, instead of buying the powder, had bought a pair of shoes;<br>  and that the tanner and the shoemaker had gained in this case, what the<br>  powder-maker and the merchant gained in the other; and that by the use of the<br>  shoes, though they were finally worn out, the man gained twice as much as he<br>  gave for them; without any loss of health, or reason, social affection, or<br>  moral susceptibility; and without any of the consequent evils.—Who cannot see<br>  that it would have increased his wealth, and that of the nation, without<br>  injury to any, and have promoted the benefit of all.<br></p><p>  This illustrates the principle with regard to ardent spirit. A man buys a<br>  quantity of it, and drinks it; when he would be, as the case with every man,<br>  in all respects better without it. It is to him an entire loss. The merchant<br>  may have made a profit of one quarter of the cost, but the buyer loses the<br>  whole; and he loses the time employed in obtaining and drinking it. He loses,<br>  also, and the community loses, equal to all its deteriorating effects upon his<br>  body and mind, his children, and all who come under his influence. His land<br>  becomes less productive. The capital of course produced by this land and labor<br>  is diminished; and thus the means are diminished of future reproduction. And<br>  by the increase of expenditure in proportion to the capital, it is still<br>  farther diminished, till to meet the increasingly disproportionate expenses,<br>  the whole is often taken, and the means of future reproduction are entirely<br>  exhausted. And if there is no seed to sow, there is of course no future<br>  harvest. This is but a simple history of what is taking in thousands of cases<br>  continually; and of what is the tendency of the traffic in ardent spirit from<br>  beginning to end. It lessens the productiveness of land and labor, and of<br>  course diminishes the amount of capital; while in proportion, it increases the<br>  expenditure, and thus in both ways is constantly exhausting the means of<br>  future production. And this is its tendency, in all its bearing, in proportion<br>  to the quantity used, from the man who takes only his glass, to the man who<br>  takes his quart a day. It is a palpable and gross violation of all correct<br>  principles of political economy; and from beginning to end, tends to diminish<br>  all the sources of national wealth.<br></p>
