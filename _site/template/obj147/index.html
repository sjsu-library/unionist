    <p align="center">ANOTHER SPECIMEN!!</p><p><em>To the Editor of the Liberator,</em></p><p>  DEAR SIR—The following, which was received through the Post Office a few days  since, may be published in the Liberator, if you think proper. We wish to have  it come before the public in order to show the opposition of certain white  people to the education of their colored brethren. The letter is given, word  for word, and letter for letter, as they stand in the original. It seems to us  it would be well for  <em>‘twelve’</em>  students of a literary institution to pay some attention to spelling. In the  words  <em>‘colord’</em>  and ‘  <em>peacable’</em>  for example.</p><p>To young Beman.</p><p>  A no. of the students of this university, deeming it derogatory to themselves,  as well as to the university to have you and other colord people recite here,  do hereby warn you to desist from such a course, and if you fail to comply  with this  <em>peacable</em>  request, we swear, by the  <em>ETERNAL GODS!</em>  that we will resort to  <em>forcible</em>  means to put a stop to it.</p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <em>Twelve of us</em></p><p>  <em>    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wesleyan    University.  </em></p><p>The following was on the outside of the letter:</p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  To</p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Beman junior</p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The P.M. will please</p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  to forward this  as&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Middletown</p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  soon as possible</p><p>  An explanation of the foregoing may not be out of place, and will place the  subject in a stronger light before your readers. It is well known to those who  have perused the Liberator during the past year, from the facts given in the  2d No.,of the present volume, that a colored man of the name of Ray was  formerly a student in the Wesleyan University, and that he was under the  necessity of leaving it (the university) on account of the prejudices of  certain students. We are informed that the person who sent letters to the  Liberator, which he had received relative to Mr Ray’s leaving, incurred the  severest displeasure of those prejudiced students. It is probably known that  he was not then a member of the university. The excitement however soon passed  away, and in the course of a few months he entered the university. As the  subject of the above letter wished to pursue certain studies, instruction was  given him in that student’s room. Mr Beman recited three times each week, and  for a considerable time was unmolested other than by the reproachful terms of  a few base fellows as he passed to and fro from his recitation. His conduct  towards others was ever such as to merit a gentlemanlike deportment from them,  but this he did not receive. When those disaffected students found that  reproaches did not deter him from pursuing his course of recitations, they  resorted to other means. In going out from the university on a certain  morning, a quantity of water was thrown upon him, by which he was  <em>completely drenched.</em>  Some time in the course of the next day one of the party interested in the  affair caused a notice to be put up, calling a meeting of the students, that  evening, the spirit of which was such as to lead many to think it was written  by one not unfriendly to Mr Beman. This trick however was discovered, and  exposed at the meeting before mentioned. When the meeting was open ed, that  <em>very person</em>  who wrote the notice, and who, there is strong reason to believe, was  concerned in insulting Mr Beman, rose and  <em>    offered a resolution disapproving the conduct of those engaged in that    affair.  </em>  After the subject before the meeting had been with much warmth discussed, and  a request having been made that the student who then instructed Mr B. would  hear him recite at some other place, the meeting was dissolved. &nbsp;This  request, for the sake of producing harmony among the students, was, in form,  complied with, but owing to the subsequent advice of some friends, the  recitation went on as before, till the college vacation. Since the  Commencement, for the convenience of him who is instructing Mr B, the  recitation has not been heard in the university. All went on very well till  this letter was received, which has produced much excitement and unpleasant  feeling. It will not prevent the instruction that may be desired however.</p><p>  In this letter there is one thing not very consistent, and, to a certain  extent, unaccountable; that is, that such a request and such a threat should  be made when the subject of it does not recite in the university. It may be  that there are certain ones who are unwilling that the colored people should  be educated in any way whatever, and are endeavoring to drive those who may  wish to pursue any course of study from their places of instruction. But we  feel thankful that the  <em>‘Canterbury law’</em>  has no effect in this case, for the subject is not a  <em>‘foreigner.’</em>  ”</p><p>  The foregoing facts may be relied on, for we have received them from those who  are immediately acquainted with the circumstances.</p><p>  The Unionist and Emancipator will confer a favor by copying this  article.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  TRUTH</p><p>MIDDLETOWN, Conn. Sept. 1833.</p><p></p>
