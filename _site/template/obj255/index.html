    <p align="center">COMMUNICATIONS.</p><p align="center">No. 2.</p><p align="right">  WINDHAM, March 11  <sup>th</sup>  , 1834</p><p>  <em>Mr. Burleigh</em>  —You remember I promised to write again as soon as we had received another  Bulletin. Uncle Davy Kies seems to think they are  <em>“All Hearty”</em>  but you know he don’t reside at Head-Quarters now. The last orders were dated  at Canterbury a few rods North of Miss Crandall’s school. It was officially  announced here this morning by one of the recruiting officers, (the  <em>gentleman</em>  who ran away from Brooklyn a few years ago with some hundreds of the people’s  money, and who, in consequence of his clamorous declamations in favor of  Jackson, is now enjoying a considerable bite of Uncle Sam’s treasury pap,  against the known wishes of the people,) that Uncle Davy’s Democrats were all  ready for action. That the misunderstanding nad difficulty among the officers  had blown over and all were as good friends as ever. Col. A.T. the commanding  officer, is looking out for promotion. Uncle Davy says when all the officers  of his division get together this Spring at New-Haven, he will have the Col.  appointed Commissary, Judge, or something which he will like much better than  actual service in the field, and thus give a better chance for the under  officers. But the Col. would be altogether out of his place, on the bench. He  would appear, and no doubt feel, much like Jack Downing’s mouse, treed in an  empty flour barrel.—The old gentleman has not concluded yet whether to issue  another Proclamation or not—but he says something must be done to procure more  soldiers. He don’t seem to like the appearance of the old Republican army, and  what looks more cloudy than any thing else, he don’t think it will do to come  into action till he gets a new recruit from Windham. But every good soldier  listed in the Republican army just as soon as&nbsp; they found out what Uncle  Davy and the ‘Arch Bishop’ were up to. You might as well undertake to make  Bull-Frog pond run right over ‘Zion’s Hill’ as to get one of the Republicans  to join the enemy.</p><p>  We have just nominated our candidate to represent this district in the next  Legislature. But he don’t care any thing about the office. Col. Spafford is  one of the genuine old fashioned republicans, a straight forward, common sense  man, who, if he should be elected, will do the thing that is right. He is not  for abolishing Sabbath laws, or Thanksgiving laws. He believes in none of the  new-fangled black laws, or New-Haven memorials, but will go straight a-head as  every independent republican should do, supporting such measures only as will  operate equally upon all our citizens. He will never consent, like Mr. Pearl,  to put his eggs in Judson’s basket.</p><p align="right">REPUBLICAN ELECTOR</p>
