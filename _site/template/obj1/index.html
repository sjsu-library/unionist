    <p><em>From the (Brooklyn) Unionist, August 29</em></p><p>  The last Advertiser declares that the story of the exclusion of Miss  Crandall’s scholars from the meeting house “is wholly false.” We expressed  surprise at a declaration so unqualified, and whether we had not some cause to  do so, we leave our readers to decide, after they have read the following  correspondence and the statement subjoined to it.</p><p>  We say nothing of the feelings which must have dictated such a course, except  that we envy not their possessor. We wish merely to put on&nbsp; record the  simple fact, that Miss Crandall’s pupils cannot attend public worship on the  sabbath, in the only church within three miles of Miss C’s residence, without  being called in question for so doing,—nay more—that they are virtually  excluded from that place of worship, though some of them it is said are  members of the church which regularly assembles there for public worship. And  this is a land professedly Christian, in a State which boasts of its  benevolent efforts to diffuse the blessings of the gospel among the distant  heathen.”</p><p align="center">——</p><p align="center">To Miss PRUDENCE CRANDALL.</p><p>  When the committee visited you last February, stating their objections to your  school, they understood from you, by your voluntary suggestion, that you  should never desire, and never would put your coloured scholars into the  meeting house — that you could have preaching at your own house, either black  or white, and you also added, that the citizens of Canterbury need have no  anxiety on that account, they might be assured, no such request would ever be  made.</p><p>  It appears now, that you have departed from this voluntary declaration and put  your colored scholars into pews ever occupied by the white females of the  parish. We ask you to inform us soon, by whose license, you have thus taken  possession of that part of the meeting house.&nbsp; Canterbury July 26th 1833</p><p>SOLOMON PAYNE,</p><p>  ANDREW HARRIS,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <strong>}&nbsp;</strong>  Society Com'tee.</p><p>ISAAC KNIGHT.</p><p>  (A true copy.)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; July 20, 1833.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Please inform Dr. Harris to-day.</p><p align="center">——</p><p align="right">  <em>Canterbury, July</em>  29, 1833.</p><p>TO SOLOMON PAYNE, ANDREW HARRIS, and ISAAC KNIGHT,</p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp; Gentlemen—I received a letter from you on the 27  <sup>th</sup>  in which you asked me to inform you soon by whose licence I have taken  possession of that part of the meeting house that was occupied by my colored  scholars on the sabbath previous.</p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp; I can inform you that the authority, whether lawful or unlawful,  by which I permitted my family to enter the gallery of your church, was  permission received from two of the Society’s committee, viz. Dr. Harris and  Deacon Bacon.</p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp; On Saturday the 6  <sup>th</sup>  of this month I sent a verbal request by Samuel L. Hough to the gentlemen whom  I address, asking your permission to attend Divine worship with you on the  sabbath. I asked Captain Hough to inform you that I would purchase seats  sufficient for my scholars if agreeable to you, if not, any part or portion of  the meeting house you might see fit for us to occupy, would be acceptable. Of  this Mr. Hough said he informed you. Dr. Harris, in answer, said we might  occupy the seat in the gallery appropriated to colored persons. Mr. Hough then  remarked that the seat would not be sufficient for the scholars—Deacon Bacon  then replied, that we might take the next pews until we had enough to be  seated.</p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp; Truly I said to the Committee that visited me in February  last—The scholars who come here shall not trouble you on the Sabbath, for we  can have preaching, either by colored or white ministers in our own house. The  committee made me no reply at the time if I am not mistaken, and I think I am  not.</p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp; Upon mature consideration (as regular preaching here was not very  readily obtained) I considered that I had done entirely wrong in depriving my  scholars of the privilege of attending religious worship in this village.</p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp; These are my reasons for asking the privilege of entering your  church; and all the licence I have received is as given above.</p><p align="center">  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yours  with respect,</p><p>P.
