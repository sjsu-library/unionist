    <p align="center"><strong>MISCELLANY.</strong></p><p align="right">For the Unionist.</p><p align="center">FORGIVENESS.</p><p align="center">A TALE.</p><p align="center">_ _ _</p><p align="center">“To err, is human—to forgive, divine.”</p><p align="center">_ _ _</p><p align="center"><em>Concluded.</em></p><p>  Various were the conjectures concerning the cause of her sudden disappearance,  and when at last they ventured to question Matilda, she replied with a great  many signs and a few hypocritical tears, that her father had placed her under  the car of his sister-in-law, the widow of an eminent physician, thinking her  experience and virtuous example might be of service to Emily, that she was  grieved for the cause, and wished not to be question on the subject. Thus, by  her false insinuations, she deprived her of the esteem of the world—that world  which will on day  <em>worship</em>  and the next  <em>stab</em>  you. Not contented with this, she persuaded Mr. Minnette to disinherit his  daughter, and make a will in favor of the little George, but her cruelty was  not to go unpunished. By some unforeseen losses in trade Mr. Minnette became  bankrupt, and was obliged to sell his splendid establishment in —— street, and  remove to a small house which belonged to Emily’s mother, and which was the  only property he could not be deprived of. But to return to Emily.</p><p>  The picture of former days would sometimes rise, and appear like a fairy  dream, from which she had been too soon awakened. She thought of the kind  mother who had been ever ready to gratify her childish wishes—and of Edward,  too, she thought much. Would he believe his sister’s falsehoods? was a  question that often perplexed her. And were there no mingling of resentment in  these recollections? Not any. Her heart had been taught a better discipline.</p><p>  Two years passed away, and Emily found peace, if not happiness. She was now  twenty-one years old, and it was in her power to retaliate her injuries, by  turning her father out of her house, which was now in her possession; but  instead of this she wrote a long and kind letter, entreating him to occupy it  as long as he wished.</p><p>  Having but little to engage her attention, Emily offered to teach a school for  the children of the village. For this purpose, a room was fitted up in a small  light building, erected near the river for the convenience of washing. During  her residence with her kind aunt, it had been her favorite care to ornament  and improve it. She had planted all around it the rose of cassia, jessamine,  honeysuckle and grape vines. Their mingled blossoms and intertwining branches  formed a luxuriant drapery, which soon became one mass of living verdure. From  this little nest of flowers, an avenue, shaded by old elms, led down to the  river, whose smooth surface was broken into ripples by the dipping branches of  the weeping willow, as its waters went sparkling and gleaming along in their  noiseless beauty. Here, in pleasant weather, Emily often ranged her scholars,  in the open air; and then there were bright eyes and happy faces, for children  do not love the confinement of a school room. The exercises of the day were  generally concluded with a hymn and prayer, in which all were taught to join.</p><p>  It was near the close of a delightful day in June, and their melodious voices  were just breaking the stillness of that beautiful solitude, when a gentleman,  attracted by the sound, came to the opposite bank, and, concealed by the  shade, listened with intense delight to the infant warblers.</p><p>  The last note died away, and a solemn pause ensued. “Now, my dear little  children,” said Emily, “will you join me, with your whole hearts, in a prayer  to our Heavenly Father who has watched over and protected us through the day.”  She then kneeled down on the green earth, and was soon encircled by her cherub  band of scholars, who also knelt and softly repeated, after their youthful  instructress, The Lord’s Prayer. Then came the fervent “amen”—“Amen!” repeated  their innocent lips, and “Amen!” echoed the green hills. Then, slowly, they  all arose, kissed Emily, one by one, crossed the little bridge, and  disappeared.</p><p>  But the stranger yet remained. It was Edward Brumiere, once the friend of  Emily—and if he had ever doubted her, could he any longer question the  goodness and purity of the beautiful being before him? It was impossible. A  moment, and he was at her side. Surprise deepened the rose on her cheek, and  she confessed the pleasure she felt in again meeting him. She extended her  hand to him with a cordial smile, for she had not yet learned to hide her  feelings under the mask of indifference.</p><p>  “I come from your father, my dear Emily. He is not very well, and feels the  want of your kindness and good nursing.”</p><p>  “But where is my ———mother?” she enquired, hesitatingly. “She is obliged to  divide her attentions between him and your little brother, who has been  sometime ill, of a lingering complaint, which they fear will terminate in a  consumption. But are you quite willing to forget your resentment?” “I have  none.” “Your injuries then?” “I freely forgive them as I hope to be forgiven.”</p><p>  “Do you know their extent? Driven from your home, calumniated, disinherited,  by one who pledged herself your friend.”</p><p>  While enumerating these, he closely watched her countenance, and finding there  no expression but forgiving love, he continued, “or do you not feel their  force?” An unbidden tear fell down her cheek, silently refuting the charge of  insensibility.</p><p>  Love sprung in his heart spontaneous; and tenderly taking her hand, he said  with much emotion, “Amiable girl!—have you no connection with earth, that you  have divested yourself of human passions and frailties.”</p><p>  “Afflictions have been sanctified to me, and have taught me that hatred and  happiness cannot exist in the same bosom.”</p><p>  “Matilda is my sister; forgive me, Emily! I believed what she said of you! I  could almost  <em>hate</em>  her for  <em>your</em>  sake, had you not given me a better example.”</p><p>  “It is perfectly natural to believe the assertions of those we love; but I  hope my study may be to contradict the tongue of slander by my conduct. Anger  so blinds our reason, that Matilda might imagine me the unkind, guilty  creature she represents me. Thus saying, she led the way to the house, where  she introduced Edward to her aunt.</p><p>The next morning found them at Mr. Minnette’s door.</p><p>  Edward remained in the parlor, that he might put no restraint upon the  feelings of either party, while Emily was shown to her father’s room. She  clung round his neck—he embraced her, and she once more felt happy in his  returning love.</p><p>  The open door of an adjoining room discovered Matilda, bending over the bed of  her sick child, with all a mother’s fondness in her looks. In her deep anxiety  the predominant expression of unbending pride was lost; and instead, there  seemed something like repentance, nay, even kindness as her eye rested on  Emily.</p><p>  From this time, Emily divided her cares between her father and brother, and  determined by her attentions to merit the love of her family. Perhaps she was  more condescending than some, yet none thought her mean-spirited, or weak, or  respected her the less; but all admired the forgiving spirit she displayed.</p><p>  Mr. Minnette soon recovered, which gave some reason to suspect that his  disorder originated in remorse; and now, Emily transferred all her attentions  to her suffering brother. She had, while with her aunt (who was the medical  adviser of the whole village) acquired considerable knowledge of roots and  herbs, and these she successfully employed in his recovery.</p><p>  Every day she carried the sufferer out of doors in her arms for the benefit of  exercise and fresh air, of which Matilda, by a mistake in the art of nursing,  had deprived him. He soon felt the good effect of the change, and the  delighted mother saw once more the glow of health upon his cheek, and  returning activity in his tiny limbs.</p><p>  Matilda’s haughty spirit had been broken down by adversity, and Emily’s  conduct had shamed “the offending spirit” out of her. Her understanding was  naturally good, but it had been perverted by a faulty education, dictated by  an injudiciously fond parent. A train of concurring circumstances roused her  better feelings and they triumphed over the errors of education and the  habitual follies of many years! and she bent before the altar of her God, a  repentant woman and a humble and sincere christian. And now, from being the  most wretched, they became, proverbially, the most united and happy family in  New-York. Having performed her duties at home, Emily, according to promise,  returned to her aunt, accompanied by Edward, who by the consent of all parties  had become her betrothed husband.</p><p>  “Let us be married, Emily,” said he, “on the anniversary of the river scene;  then I shall unite in one the two most interesting events of my life, my  marriage and the event which led to it.”</p><p>  A year from that day, Emily became the wife of Edward—and each succeeding one  finds her in the midst of love and happiness surrounded by her family of  little ones, to whom Edward annually repeats the Tale of Forgiveness.</p>
