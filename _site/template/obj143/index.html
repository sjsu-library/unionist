    <p>  “Judge Daggett.—This respected magistrate, we perceive, was not compelled, as  we supposed, to sentence a Christian sister to an infamous punishment for the  crime of teaching other Christian sisters the knowledge by which they could be  qualified to do good to their class. The case was carried directly to the  Court of Errors. The Hon. Judge, in giving his opinion in favor of the  <em>constitutionality</em>  of the “Black law” did not, as we learn by a private letter, commit himself to  any opinion in favor of the law itself.</p><p>  The question of constitutionality turned mainly upon this point, whether the  persons affected by the law are  <em>citizens</em>  of the United States. The judge relied on the definition in Webster, that  citizens are those who enjoy the elective franchise, and can hold real estate,  and it has never been judicially decided that blacks can do this, or sue in  the United States Courts. A writer in the “Unionist,” who seems to have  examined the subject, shows that the right of suffrage may be exercised in  New-Hampshire by male  <em>inhabitants;</em>  in Vt. By a  <em>man;</em>  in Mass. By male  <em>citizens,</em>  (under which term blacks have always voted, and one has held a seat as  representative,) in R. I. by a  <em>subject;</em>  in N.Y. blacks of certain qualifications can vote; in Pa. every  <em>freeman,</em>  and the same in N.C. and Tenn. The constitutions of Md., Va. N.C. Ky. Ala.  Miss. Mo. And Lou. Limit the right of voting to free  <em>white</em>  citizens, which would be superfluous unless blacks may be citizens. The same  number of the Unionist contains extracts from speeches delivered in the  convention of New-York, 1821, by such men as Peter A. Jay, James Kent, Rufus  King, Abraham Van Vechten, all maintaining expressly that people of color are  citizens. Also a letter from De Witt Clinton to President Adams in 1826,  claiming Gilbert Horton as ‘a citizen of this State,’ unlawfully imprisoned at  Washington.”</p>
