    <p align="center">THE RIOTS IN NEW-YORK,</p><p align="center">  <em>    Gotten up by the ‘Courier and Enquirer,’ and the ‘Commercial Advertiser.’<br>  </em></p><p>  &nbsp; &nbsp;In another column we have given some account of the outrage<br>  committed in New York by the partizans [sic] of the&nbsp; Colonization<br>  Society,* and the opposers of abolition. We feel the deepest shame that such<br>  violations of the public peace, and of the rights of citizens, should be&nbsp;<br>  perpetrated in our country, in this age of the world. But as they have<br>  transpired, we are bound to publish them—and to attribute&nbsp; these wicked<br>  works to their real authors. Who are they? Who are the incendiaries? Not<br>  surely the combustible materials which have been inflamed; but those<br>  unprincipled men who have inflamed them. Not the mob—but the men who have<br>  gathered, excited, and directed the mob. We say without hesitation, that James<br>  Watson Webb and Col. Stone should be held pre-eminently responsible for the<br>  late notorious proceedings in the city of New York. Their papers, ‘the Courier<br>  and Enquirer,’ and the ‘Commercial Advertiser,’ have been, for more than a<br>  year past, industriously circulating (through a larger portion of the<br>  community, than any other paper could,) the grossest misrepresentations of the<br>  sentiments and purposes of the Abolitionists. They have done all in their<br>  power to awaken the hatred, and&nbsp; direct the blind zeal of the ignorant,<br>  reckless, and unprincipled against a portion of their fellow citizens, whose<br>  only offence is, that they are pleading the cause of bleeding humanity—ay, the<br>  cause of millions of Americans, who are held in abject bondage, or paralyzing<br>  degradation. Paragraphs have repeatedly appeared in their papers, which more<br>  than intimated that any measures should be resorted to, for the suppression of<br>  the Abolitionists. It was owing to the exertions of the ‘Courier and Enquirer’<br>  and the ‘Commercial Advertiser,’ that the disgraceful proceedings took place<br>  there last fall, intended to prevent the formation of the New-York<br>  Anti-Slavery Society. And we may fairly attribute to them, more perhaps than<br>  to any other agents of the pro slavery party, the succession of riots that<br>  have recently occurred. —The style, in which Messrs. Webb and Stone have<br>  remarked upon these transactions, (more than half excusing) is&nbsp; adapted,<br>  if it be not designed, to urge on the populace to further outrage.<br></p><p>  &nbsp; &nbsp;Now we would ask the intelligent and candid, what does this<br>  procedure of the pro slavery party prove? What, but that they are conscious<br>  they cannot meet the opposers of American oppression and cruelty, in fair<br>  discussion!—If they could disprove our statements, refute our arguments, or<br>  turn the point of our appeal, are they indeed such men, that they would still,<br>  of choice, resort to the base means they have been using? We are unwilling to<br>  think they are so bad. Is it not rather because they foresee that moral means<br>  can never effect their purposes, that they resort to brute force?&nbsp; We<br>  think so. Let the intelligent and candid judge.—<br>  <em>Brooklyn Unionist.</em></p><p align="center"></p>
