    <em>"To the Editors of the Unionist:—</em>  As many persons are so prejudiced against color as to pronounce a black<br>  complexion an evidence of Divine displeasure, you are requested to insert in<br>  the “Unionist”&nbsp; the following extracts form a speech delivered in the<br>  house of Delegates of Maryland at their session in November, 1789, by that<br>  upright and enlightened statesman, William Pinkney, Esq. Let his sentiments be<br>  contrasted with those to whom I have alluded. If as Archbishop Seeker has<br>  asserted that “every death in battle is a murder,” the writer of this<br>  introductory article verily believes that for the death of a Slave occasioned<br>  by his servile condition the owner is responsible, and our country has<br>  abundant and fearful reason to deprecate the solemn and awful denunciation<br>  expressed in thsi (sic) sacred interrogatory—“Shall I not visit for these<br>  things, saith the Lord? Shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as<br>  this?” – HUMANITAS”<br></p><p>  “Mr. Speaker, Iniquitous and most dishonorable to Maryland is that dreary<br>  system of partial bondage, which her laws have hitherto supported with a<br>  solicitude worthy of a better object, and Citizens by their practice<br>  countenanced. Founded in a disgraceful traffic, to which the parent country<br>  lent her fostering aid, from motives of interest, but which even she would<br>  have disdained to encourage, had England been the destined mart of such<br>  inhuman merchandize; its continuance is as shameful as its origin.<br></p><p>  Eternal infamy await the abandoned miscreants whose selfish souls could ever<br>  prompt them to rob unhappy Afric of her souls, and freight them hither by<br>  thousands, to poison the fair Eden of liberty with the rank weed o individual<br>  bondage. Nor is it more to the credit of our ancestors that they did not<br>  command these savage spoilers to bear their hateful cargo to another shore,<br>  where the shrine of freedom knew no votaries, and every purchaser would at<br>  once be both a master and a slave.<br></p><p>  In the dawn of time, Mr. Speaker, when the rough feelings of barbarism had not<br>  experienced the softening touches of refinement, such an unprincipled<br>  prostration of the inherent rights of human nature, would have needed the<br>  gloss of an apology: but to the everlasting reproach of Maryland, be it said,<br>  that when her citizens rivalled the nation from whence they emigrated, in the<br>  knowledge of moral principles, and an enthusiasm in the cause of general<br>  freedom, they stooped to become the purchasers of their fellow creatures, and<br>  to introduce an hereditary bondage into the bosom of their country, which<br>  should widen with every successive generation.<br></p><p>  For my part, I would willingly draw the veil of oblivion over this disgusting<br>  scene of iniquity, but that the present abject state of those who are<br>  descended from these kidnapped sufferers, perpetually brings it forward to the<br>  memory.<br></p><p>  But wherefore should we confine the edge of censure to our ancestors, or those<br>  from whom they purchased? Are not we equally guilty?<br>  <em>They</em>  strewed around the seeds of slavery;<br>  <em>we</em>  cherish and sustain the growth.—<br>  <em>They</em>  introduced the system;<br>  <em>we</em>  enlarge, invigorate, and conform it.—Yes, let it be handed down to posterity,<br>  that the people of Maryland, who could fly to arms with the promptitude of<br>  Roman citizens, when the hand of oppression was lifted up against<br>  themselves—who could behold their country desolated, and their citizens<br>  slaughtered, who could brave with unshaken firmness, every calamity of war,<br>  before they would submit to the smallest infringement of their rights—that<br>  this very people could yet see thousands of their fellow creatures, within the<br>  limits of their territory, bending beneath an unnatural yoke; and instead of<br>  being assiduous to destroy their shackles, anxious to immortalize their<br>  duration, so that a nation of slaves might for ever exist in a country where<br>  freedom is its boast.<br></p><p>  “Even the very earth itself, (says some celebrated author) which teems with<br>  profusion under the cultivating hand of the freeborn laborer, shrinks into<br>  barrenness from the contaminating sweat of a slave.” This sentiment is not<br>  more figuratively beautiful than substantially just.<br></p><p>  Survey the countries, sir, where the hand of freedom conducts the ploughshare<br>  and compare their produce with yours.—Your granaries in this view appear like<br>  the store houses of emmets [a colloquial word for “ant”], though not supplied<br>  with equal industry. To trace the cause of this disparity between the fruits<br>  of a freeman’s voluntary labors, animated by the hope of profit, and the<br>  slow-paced efforts of a slave, who acts only from compulsion, who has no<br>  incitement to exertion but fear—no prospect of remuneration to encourage—would<br>  be insulting the understanding. The cause and the effect are too obvious to<br>  escape observation.<br></p><p>  But it has been said (and who knows but the same opinion may still have its<br>  advocates) “that nature has black balled these wretches out of society.”<br>  Gracious God! can it be supposed that they Almighty Providence intended to<br>  proscribe these victims of fraud and power, from the pale of society, because<br>  thou hast denied them the delicacy of an European complexion? Is their color,<br>  Mr. Speaker, the mark of Divine vengeance, or is it only the flimsy pretext<br>  upon which we attempt to justify our treatment of them? Arrogant and<br>  presumptuous is it this to make the dispensations of Providence subservient to<br>  the purposes of iniquity, and every slight diversity in the works of nature<br>  the apology for oppression. Thus acts the intemperate bigot in religion. He<br>  persecutes every dissenter from his creed, in the name of God, and even rears<br>  the horrid fabric of an inquisition upon heavenly foundations.<br></p><p>  I like not these holy arguments. They are as convenient for the tyrant as the<br>  patriot—the enemy as the friend of mankind. Contemplate this subject through<br>  the calm medium of philosophy, and then to know that these shackled wretches<br>  are men as well as we are, spring from the same common parent, and endued with<br>  equal faculties of mind and body, is to know enough to make us disdain to torn<br>  casuists on their complexion to the destruction of their rights. The beauty of<br>  complexion is mere matter of taste, and varies indifferent countries, nay,<br>  even in the same; and shall we dare to set up this vague, indeterminate,<br>  weathercock standard, as the criterion by which shall be decided on what<br>  complexions the rights of human nature are conferred, and to what they are<br>  denied by the great ordinances of the Deity? As if the Ruler of the Universe<br>  had made the darkness of a skin, the flatness of a nose, or the wideness of a<br>  mouth, which are only deformities or beauties as the undulating tribunal of<br>  taste shall determine the indication of his wrath.<br></p><p>  Mr. Speaker, It is pitiable to reflect on the mistaken light in which this<br>  unfortunate generation are viewed by the people in general. Hardly do they<br>  deign to rank them in the order of beings above the mere animal that grazes<br>  the field of its owner. That an humble, dusky, unlettered wretch that drags<br>  the chain of bondage through the weary round of life, with no other privilege<br>  but that of existing for another’s benefit should have been intended by heaven<br>  for their equal they will not believe. But let me appeal to the intelligent<br>  mind, and ask, in what respect they are our inferiors? Though they have never<br>  been taught to tread the paths of science, or embellish human life by literary<br>  acquirements; tho’ they cannot soar into the regions of taste and sentiment,<br>  or explore the scenes of philosophical research, is it to be inferred that<br>  they want the power, if the yoke of slavery did not check each aspiring effort<br>  and clog the springs of action? Let the kind hand of an assiduous care mature<br>  their powers, let the genius of freedom excite to manly thought and liberal<br>  investigation, we should not then be found to monopolize the vigor of fancy,<br>  the delicacy of taste, or the solidity of scientific endowments. Born with<br>  hearts as susceptible of virtuous impressions as our own, and with minds as<br>  capable of benefitting by improvement, they are in all respects our equals by<br>  nature; and he who thinks otherwise has never reflected, that talents however<br>  great may perish unnoticed and unknown, unless auspicious circumstances<br>  conspire to draw them forth, and animate their exertions in the round of<br>  knowledge. As well might you expect to see the bubbling fountain gush from the<br>  burning sands of Arabia, as that the inspiration of genius or the enthusiastic<br>  glow of sentiment should rouse the mind which has yielded its elasticity to<br>  habitual subjection. Thus the ignorance and the vices of these wretches are<br>  solely the result of situation, and therefore no evidence of their<br>  inferiority. Like the flower whose culture has been neglected, and perishes<br>  amidst permitted weeds ere it opens it blossom to the Spring, they only prove<br>  the imbecility of human nature unassisted and oppressed. Well has Cowper said—<br></p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘’Tis<br>  liberty alone which gives the flower<br></p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of fleeting<br>  life its lustre and perfume,<br></p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And we are<br>  weeds without it.’<br></p>
