    <p>FROM THE BROOKLYN UNIONIST, AUGUST 29.</p><p>TRIAL OF MISS PRUDENCE CRANDALL.</p><p>Windham County ss. County Court August term A.D. 1833.</p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; State of<br>  Connecticut<br></p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>  <em>    vs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>  </em>  information on the Statute, &amp;c.<br></p><p>Prudence Crandall</p><p>  Miss Crandall was originally brought before Rufus Adams, Esq. a Justice of the<br>  Peace for Windham County, by a warrant issued by him on a complaint by the<br>  Grand Juror of the town of Canterbury, charging her with violating a statute<br>  law of the State of Connecticut passed at the last session of the Legislature<br>  in regard to teaching, boarding, harboring, &amp;c. persons of color, not<br>  inhabitants of the State. She entered a demurrer to the complaint, the Court<br>  judged the complaint sufficient and thereupon ordered Miss Crandall to give<br>  bond with surety in the sum of $150, for her appearance before the next County<br>  Court to be tried on said complaint, and abide the judgment of said Court<br>  thereon. Failing to procure bonds, she was committed to prison. The cause came<br>  on for trial before the County Court on Friday, August 23d: C.F. Cleaveland,<br>  Esq. the Attorney for the State, being absent from indisposition, the Court<br>  appointed Jonathan A. Welch, Esq. special attorney to conduct the prosecution.<br>  A.T. Judson and I. Bulkley, Esqrs. were associate counsel.&nbsp; Hon. Calvin<br>  Goddard, Hon. W. W. Ellsworth and Henry Strong, Esq. appeared for the defence.<br>  The jury being empannelled and sworn, the counsel for the defence objected to<br>  one of the jurors from Canterbury on the ground that he had signed petitions,<br>  &amp;c. in respect to Miss Crandall’s school, and taken active measures to put<br>  it down. The Court sustained the objection, and the juror was excused. They<br>  also objected to another of the jurors on the ground that he was a member of<br>  the Legislature which passed the law, was one of those who voted for it, and<br>  had, of course, formed an opinion with respect to its constitutionality. The<br>  Court decided that the juror was competent to sit. (He got excused, however,<br>  on account of sickness.) The information against Miss Crandall consisted of<br>  two counts. The first charged “that the said Prudence Crandall, on the 24<br>  <sup>th</sup>  day of June last, with force, and arms, in a certain school which before that<br>  time had been and then was set up in said Canterbury, for the instruction and<br>  teaching of colored persons, to wit: Theodosia De Grasse, Ann Peterson, Amelia<br>  Elizabeth Wilder, Ann Eliza Hammond, and others whose names are unknown, who<br>  at the time so taught and instructed were not inhabitants of any town in this<br>  state, which said acts were done, by the said Prudence Crandall, without the<br>  consent, in writing, first had and obtained of a majority of the civil<br>  authority and select men of the said town of Canterbury, within which said<br>  school was then instructed, against the peace of this state, and contrary to<br>  the form and effect of the statute in such case made and provided.”<br></p><p>  The second count charged “that the defendant, with force and arms did wilfully<br>  and knowingly harbor and board, and aid and assist in harboring and boarding<br>  certain colored persons (named above,) who, when so harbored and boarded, were<br>  not inhabitants of any town in this State—without the consent in writing of<br>  the civil authority and select men, &amp;c.”<br></p><p>Plea, Not Guilty.</p><p>The following witnesses were then called on the part of the prosecution.</p><p>  <em>Asahel Bacon</em>  said that he had called at Miss Crandall’s house in the month of June last,<br>  having heard that she had taken some scholars from abroad. Capt. Sanger<br>  accompanied him. They were both select men of the town. Miss Crandall invited<br>  them into her house very politely. They asked her in relation to her scholars.<br>  She said she had four who were from New York and one from Hartford.—She called<br>  them in and introduced them. Theodosia De Grass, Amelia Elizabeth Wildes, and<br>  Catherine Ann Weldon, he thinks were the names of those called. Witness did<br>  not remember the day of the month that he called—thinks it was the day after<br>  the girls came—certainly soon after.<br></p><p>  <em>Ebenezer Sanger</em>  coincided in the statement of Mr. Bacon.<br></p><p>  <em>George Cady</em>  had conversed with Miss Crandall—went to her house on Friday last to summon as<br>  witnesses to support this prosecution, some of the girls who were attending<br>  the school. One of those named in this subpoena said that she had been sent<br>  for him, on account of the sickness of her mother, and wished him to excuse<br>  her attendance at Court—told her that he could not, but would state the<br>  circumstances to the public prosecutor. Miss Crandall said that she did not<br>  see that there was any need of witnesses at all, for she should confess that<br>  she had broken the law.<br></p><p>  <em>Ann Peterson,</em>  This witness was a colored girl, said to be a pupil of Miss Crandall, and was<br>  one of those named in the information to whom Miss C. had given instruction.<br>  Mr. Ellsworth objected to the examination of the witness on the ground that<br>  she could not testify without implicating herself. Mr. Welch read the clause<br>  of the statute under which this prosecution was sustained, in which it was<br>  enacted that the pupils in a school kept contrary to the act, might be<br>  compelled to testify. Mr. Ellsworth said that he denied, altogether, the<br>  competency of the Legislature to compel a witness to testify, or answer<br>  questions that might implicate him, even to render himself liable in<br>  debt—otherwise a witness might be compelled to testify to what would charge<br>  him with the crime of murder. He alluded to the State Constitution and Bill or<br>  Rights which he claimed protected every person from criminating himself by<br>  being compelled to give testimony. It was contrary to fundamental principles.<br>  In this case the witness might make herself an aider and abettor, and subject<br>  herself to the penalties imposed by the statute. Mr. Judson claimed that the<br>  witness would not by her testimony implicate herself. The law was penal, and<br>  must be construed strictly. Even if she was aware that she was instructed by<br>  Miss Crandall, it would not charge herself with any crime. Mr. Judson read at<br>  length from Starkie on evidence, to show that the witness ought, on common law<br>  principles, to be examined, and was bound to answer questions as to what she<br>  knew of Miss C.’s school. At all events he claimed that, in this instance,<br>  such must be the case as the Legislature had expressly enacted that the pupils<br>  should be witnesses. Mr. Ellsworth, in reply, said he apprehended the question<br>  to be whether the Legislature possessed the power to compel a witness to<br>  convict himself. He read from the opinion of Chief Justice Hosmer, in the 8<br>  <sup>th</sup>  Con. Rep. and also from the case of the people vs. Mather, in 4<br>  <sup>th</sup>  Wendell’s Reps on the subject of examining witnesses.&nbsp; By the principles<br>  decided these cases, which were the settled law of the land, he claimed that<br>  the witness was not compelled to answer any questions in relation to her<br>  knowledge of this school. The Court decided that the witness, under the<br>  circumstances, was not protected, but must be examined.—The examination was<br>  about to proceed, when Mr. Ellsworth rose and stated to the Court that the<br>  witness had been advised not to answer interrogatories in regard to her<br>  knowledge of this school. He felt it to be his duty now to repeat this advice.<br>  He wished the Court, however, distinctly to understand that the counsel for<br>  the accused had taken this course not with a view to embarrass the trial, but<br>  solely from a sense of duty. He conscientiously believed that the legal rights<br>  of the witness were such that she should not be compelled to testify. The<br>  Counsel for the prosecution, asked the witness when she came to Canterbury,<br>  but she declined answering the question. A number of other questions were then<br>  proposed to the witness, the principal of which were—“Has Miss Crandall kept a<br>  school for colored girls not inhabitants of this state?”—“Will you say whether<br>  the defendant has or has not instructed any person of color other than<br>  yourself since the 10<br>  <sup>th</sup>  of June last, or boarded and instructed colored persons not inhabitants of<br>  this state?” To all these and other questions of a similar character, the<br>  witness decline giving an answer, on the ground that she could not do so<br>  without criminating herself. The counsel for the prosecution then called<br>  <em>Catherine Ann Weldon</em>  and<br>  <em>Eliza Hammond,</em>  both girls of color, and charged with being pupils of Miss Crandall, and<br>  propounded to them the same questions as above; but they for the same reason,<br>  and by the advice of counsel, declined answering. The prosecuting Attorney<br>  reserved to himself, though he waived for the present, the right of moving for<br>  an order that these witnesses be committed for a contempt of court.<br></p><p>  <em>Jacob C. Gould</em>  said he was acquainted with Ann Eliza Hammond. She belonged to Providence R.I.<br>  had known her since she was a child—was the daughter of Thomas Hammond, who<br>  died in 1826. Her mother now lived in Providence—the father at his death was<br>  worth from 1500 to $2000 in real estate.<br></p><p>  <em>Levi Kneeland,</em>  Was not connected with Miss Crandall’s school except as an adviser in relation<br>  to it—was pastor of the Church to which Miss Crandall belonged—had seen<br>  several of the colored girls who were present at his church during the summer.<br>  In reply to a question whether he had seen one of the girls elsewhere than at<br>  his church declined answering. In reply to the question whether he had not<br>  seen one of them at Miss Crandall’s, declined answering—decline to answer<br>  whether he had advised Miss Crandall in relation to her school. Declined<br>  answering whether or not he had been in Miss Crandall’s school since the 10<br>  <sup>th</sup>  of June last. The court, having decided that he was bound to answer the<br>  questions put to him, and that the reasons he offered for refusing to do so,<br>  namely, that he might subject himself to a prosecution, and entangle himself<br>  in difficulties, were insufficient, granted a motion for a mittimus to commit<br>  him to prison and he was taken into custody by the Sheriff.<br></p><p>  <em>Eliza Parkis</em>  (a woman of color) was acquainted with Ann Eliza Hammond, one of the girls<br>  that Miss Crandall was charged with having instructed. Has seen her in<br>  Providence—has also seen her at Miss Crandall’s, and slept in a room with Miss<br>  De Grasse a colored girl from New York. Miss Crandall employed witness to work<br>  for her, because she said she did not wish to keep her scholars out of school<br>  to do the work. Never saw any of the girls in school.—Have seen them have<br>  books and study them.<br></p><p>  <em>Rowland Greene</em>  (affirmed) Has often heard that Miss Crandall kept a school for colored girls<br>  in Canterbury—has been at the house often, was called as a physician—went<br>  there and saw several colored girls—heard some of them recite in grammar,<br>  geography, &amp;c. Some of the girls has been at his own house. Has seen a<br>  little girl there, said to be from New York—has heard Miss Crandall talk<br>  concerning her scholars from abroad—does not recollect to have heard her say<br>  that they were from New York.<br></p><p>  <em>Mr. Kneeland</em>  was not placed at the bar by the Sheriff at his request, and said he intended<br>  no disrespect to the Court by declining to answer the interrogatories put to<br>  him, and being advised that he should not implicate himself by doing so, he<br>  was ready to answer. He proceeded to state that he had visited Miss Crandall’s<br>  school twice. Once it was under the charge of another person. He had prayed in<br>  the school and conversed with the girls on religious subjects—does not<br>  remember faces as well as people in general—could not therefore positively<br>  identify any one of those present as being the ones seen at Miss<br>  Crandall’s—should think they were—his best belief on the subject would be a<br>  guess—has taken meals at Miss Crandall’s and eaten with her pupils—has heard<br>  them recite their lessons—thinks he has heard Miss Hammond spoken of either by<br>  the defendant or her sister. Miss Crandall has conversed with him in relation<br>  to her scholars—thinks she has told him that some of them were from New York,<br>  and some from Providence and New-Haven.<br></p><p>  <em>Albert Hinckley,</em>  has been at Miss Crandall’s several times since the month of June last—does<br>  not know whether he has been in her school room as he knows not in which room<br>  it is kept, has not conversed with her on the subject of the residence of her<br>  scholars—called on her as a friend and conversed on various topics—has heard<br>  that she kept a school for colored persons—has heard her speak of her scholars<br>  and school—has seen colored ladies at her house and has taken tea with<br>  them—cannot say whether any of those present were the ones or not.<br></p><p>  <em>Eliza Glasko,</em>  This witness was a colored girl belonging to the school but an inhabitant of<br>  this state. The same objection was made to examining her as was before made in<br>  respect to the others, but the objection was overruled by the Court. She<br>  however declined answering the questions propounded to her. The prosecuting<br>  attorney moved the court for a mittimus to commit the witness for contempt of<br>  court. The court granted the motion and ordered the clerk to make out a<br>  mittimus.<br></p><p>  <em>Hezekiah Crandall,</em>  (affirmed) His sister Prudence keeps a school at Canterbury for colored<br>  girls—knows Ann Eliza Hammond—could not certainly recognize any other that was<br>  present except perhaps Ann Peterson—has never been in the school nor heard the<br>  pupils recite—has seen Ann Eliza Hammond at his sisters, often, during June<br>  and July,—supposed she boarded there and was instructed by his sisters with<br>  others—knows by sight and name Amelia Wildes—does not know where she is<br>  now—has not heard his sister say any thing on the subject of her school for<br>  some time—she has resided in Canterbury some portion of the time for twelve<br>  years past.<br></p><p>  <em>James Chandler</em>  said he was at Miss Crandall’s several times last spring (not being able to<br>  say with certainty whether he had been there since the passage of the law he<br>  was not interrogated farther.)<br></p><p>  <em>George Roberts</em>  went to Miss Crandall’s about five months ag and carried a colored girl, Miss<br>  Hammond to the school—Miss Hammond it was said belonged to Providence, has<br>  been at Miss C’s since that time perhaps within ten weeks and drank tea—he<br>  then saw Miss Hammond but does not know whether she boarded there constantly<br>  or not—he heard her and other colored girls recite in Miss Crandall’s<br>  school—should think this was two or three months ago—has been at Miss C’s<br>  within a week but did not as he remembers see any of the girls present there<br>  at that time.<br></p><p>  <em>Mary Benson</em>  (affirmed) Has been at Miss Crandall’s school and found it very<br>  interesting—was never present but for a short time—‘tis for colored<br>  persons—saw Ann Eliza Hammond there—she is one of the scholars and boards with<br>  Miss C.—Witness recognized several of those present as among the number she<br>  had seen at Miss Crandall’s—one of the pupils, Ann Weldon was from<br>  New-York—Miss Hammond was from Providence—witness was at Miss Crandall’s five<br>  weeks since and took tea—several colored girls were at the table—does not know<br>  where any of them belonged except by report—visited the school when it was<br>  near closing and heard Miss C. give the girls instruction in Geography and<br>  Arithmetic. The prosecuting Attorney here rested his evidence, and the sheriff<br>  having served his process on Eliza Glasko was about committing her to prison,<br>  when Mr. Ellsworth interposed and stated to the court that rather than have<br>  the girl committed he should advise her to testify—again repeating that the<br>  course of the defendant’s counsel in relation to the testimony of these girls,<br>  was dictated by an imperious sense of professional duty.<br></p><p>  <em>Eliza Glasko</em>  the proceeded to give testimony. She said she was a member of Miss C’s school,<br>  and that the other girls near her were also members—one of them from<br>  Providence, the other said to be from New-York—the ordinary branches were<br>  taught them by Miss C.—reading, writing, grammar, geography, &amp;c., witness<br>  begun to go on the first of April—the school was usually opened and closed<br>  with prayer—the scriptures were read and explained daily in the school—some<br>  portions were committed to memory by the pupils and considered a part of their<br>  education.<br></p><p>Mr. Judson then opened the case on the part of the prosecution.</p><p>  He first stated the case and read the Act of the Legislature which he claimed<br>  that Miss Crandall had violated. He said that this act did not prevent any<br>  black from attending the district schools in the State, or any higher<br>  schools—that they had all the benefits of the school und, and might attend the<br>  academies, high schools, or colleges, and that too whether they were citizens<br>  of this state, of other states, or of any part of the world. The sole<br>  intention and provision of the act was, that colored persons, from another<br>  jurisdiction, should not be intruded into any town in this state, without a<br>  written permission from the select men and civil authority of the town in<br>  which they proposed to reside. This was all, and this was perfectly lawful.<br>  The whole tenor and effect of the law was to place a school for colored<br>  persons under the care and supervision of the select men and civil authority<br>  of each town. He should ask the attention of the Court to the face that the<br>  Legislature had exercised a controlling power over schools within the limits<br>  of the state since 1717. (Mr. Judson here read from an old edition of the<br>  statutes, in respect to the power which the Legislature had exercised over<br>  schools in respect to preventing disorders and the application of the public<br>  money.)—These said Mr. Judson, were schools for the instruction of all<br>  classes, and the acts which he had read, showed that the Legislature thought<br>  proper to exercise care over these schools. Such was the ancient policy of the<br>  state, and this new law was no change of policy. The state owed its present<br>  honors, its present glories, to pursuing this policy of keepings its schools<br>  under a supervising power. Nor was there anything in the Constitution of the<br>  United States to prevent it. Towns, he claimed, had a right to say who should<br>  be allowed to become inhabitants be residence in their limits and this law<br>  gave them no more power than was necessary for the exercise of that right.<br>  That the law was illiberal and reflected disgrace on the State, on the<br>  Legislature which enacted it, he denied. On the contrary, said Mr. J., there<br>  are now more than 1500 schools in the state, supported by our fund of<br>  $1,800,000, to which blacks may go without the payment of a cent. Small as the<br>  state was, smaller than single counties in some other states, these facts were<br>  true concerning it. For himself he was proud of it. Where could a parallel be<br>  found in the universe?<br></p><p>  Public policy, continued Mr. J., absolutely demands that a law of this<br>  description should be maintained. It was claimed to be unconstitutional<br>  because exclusive in its operation on a particular class. Other laws of the<br>  state were liable to the same objection. Physicians and lawyers were instances<br>  of the operation of our exclusive law. Tanners, Taverners, Surveyors, &amp;c.<br>  must all be licensed. Manufactories were liable to be visited by the select<br>  men and civil authority for the purpose of seeing that the children employed<br>  in them were properly educated. If persons came here from other states and set<br>  up manufacturing establishments they were equally liable to be visited in this<br>  way though no such provisions existed in the laws of the states from whence<br>  they come. Lawyers in this state could not purchase choses (??) in action. All<br>  these laws, with many similar ones, were passed in derogation of rights<br>  originally common to all; public policy however, required the enactment of<br>  them, as it did of the one in question, and in his opinion they all stood on<br>  similar grounds, and were, without question, in accordance with the<br>  Constitution.<br></p><p>  Mr. J. next referred to the course which other states had pursued in<br>  legislating on the subject of the blacks. He remarked on the law of Ohio. Our<br>  law is not, said Mr. J., an act of exclusion, nor an act of prohibition. It<br>  does not pretend to send away those who belong here, nor does it prohibit any<br>  from coming, but only makes it necessary that permission be first obtained.<br>  The laws of Georgia and North Carolina went so far as to authorise the<br>  imprisonment of blacks who came within their limits, even though they came in<br>  the capacity of cooks and stewards of vessels. In Tennessee blacks could not<br>  come from other states and remain within the state above twelve days without<br>  incurring penalties. In Maryland a man could not manumit his slave without his<br>  leaving the state. Even in Pennsylvania, “the land of Penn,” no free negro<br>  could remain without giving bonds for his support. All these laws Mr. J.<br>  claimed to be obnoxious to equal and indeed to greater constitutional<br>  objections than the one in question. The article in the constitution of the<br>  United States with which this law was supposed to conflict, he understood to<br>  be, the 2d section of the 4<br>  <sup>th</sup>  article:—“The citizens of each state shall be entitled to all the privileges<br>  and immunities of citizens in the several states.” Mr. J. claimed that the<br>  term “citizens” in this place, and throughout the constitution, had a<br>  technical signification—a legal meaning—that it did not include colored<br>  persons—that they were not be the constitution recognized as citizens. A<br>  certain class of colored persons, slaves) were in it considered as property.<br></p><p>  Mr. J. here referred to the laws of the United State on the subject of<br>  naturalization, reading from Ingersoll’s Digest, the several acts of Congress,<br>  and insisted that from them all, the language being precise, technical, and<br>  certain, none other than white persons could be naturalized citizens of the<br>  United States. He also read from the 2<br>  <sup>nd</sup>  Kent’s Com. 70, 71, 72, by which he further illustrated these views.<br></p><p>  There have been, continued Mr. J., concurrent acts of the State of Connecticut<br>  which give the same construction to the constitution. If “citizen” do not mean<br>  a white person only—if it be claimed that a black is a citizen, then is the<br>  constitution of our own State a nullity, for it allows “free white males”<br>  alone to be electors. The privilege of being a freeman, he claimed, to be a<br>  higher one that the right of being educated. Why should a man be educated who<br>  could not be a freeman? A person who pays a single cent State tax, or who does<br>  military duty, is entitled to the privilege of voting. In Massachusetts these<br>  qualifications were not sufficient. Each state in the Union has these local<br>  laws and customs peculiar to itself—these must all be abrogated at a blow, by<br>  deciding the law in question to be unconstitutional. Full effect however,<br>  might be given to the clause in the constitution, referred to without<br>  producing this result, and that was, by construing the term “citizen” in the<br>  manner he had before pointed out.<br></p><p>  The first act in our own statute would be nullified by a decision that this<br>  law was unconstitutional—a citizen of another State cannot maintain an action<br>  in our courts for any cause unless a substantial inhabitant of the State give<br>  bond for him. No one has doubted the constitutionality of this law, and the<br>  law in question, with respect to constitutionality, could not be distinguished<br>  from it.<br></p><p>  Mr. J. said he should conclude his remarks on this subject by alluding merely<br>  to one other argument in support of this law, and that was, that the public<br>  safety of this State, the preservation of its true interests, required this<br>  law to be enforced. The southern States might emancipate their slaves and send<br>  them all to Connecticut instead of Liberia. The influx of that species of<br>  population might be so great as to be overwhelming. (Mr. J. proceeded to<br>  remark on the effect which recent measures of the British Parliament, on the<br>  subject of slavery, might have on this question, when he was interrupted by<br>  the court, who remarked that tho’ far from inclined to restrain all the limits<br>  of the discussion, yet it did not seem pertinent to the issue to argue the<br>  policy or expediency of the laws. Mr. J. said he would not press the point.)<br>  Mr. J. hoped that he had not been misunderstood in the remarks he had made. He<br>  wished not to oppress any class of population. He heartily wished that every<br>  slave might be emancipated that every day. But if it could not be done without<br>  destruction to our constitutions, and desolating our land, he could not desire<br>  it.<br></p><p>  He would only add to the Jury that though it was true they were at liberty to<br>  consider what the court said to them on the subject of the law, as advice,<br>  still he hoped they would pay it such respect as advice from the bench was<br>  properly entitled to. A single word as to the facts. The information charged<br>  the defendant with boarding and instructing, in different counts. It was<br>  sufficient if they found her guilty on either. The day was immaterial. If they<br>  found her guilty of doing the act charged on any day, since the passage of the<br>  law, and before the filing of the information, ‘twas sufficient. It was not<br>  necessary that they should find that she had boarded or instructed each of the<br>  persons named in the information; to instruct or board one was a transgression<br>  of the law.<br></p><p>As to the proof it was abundant, conclusive.</p><p>  Mr. Ellsworth, after stating the case, and remarking on the prohibitions of<br>  the law, said that he proposed not to occupy time in relation to the facts of<br>  the case. He would willingly have advised the pupils of Miss Crandall to have<br>  testified had he not believed that in so doing they voluntarily surrendered<br>  their most sacred rights. True it was, the defendant has kept this<br>  school—‘twas no secret, and whether that constituted a crime or not was for<br>  the jury to determine. In order to convict my client, said Mr. E., you<br>  gentlemen, must find on your oaths that she had committed a crime. You may<br>  find that she has violated an act of the State Legislature, but if you also<br>  find her protected by a higher power, it will be your duty to acquit. The<br>  court he was fully assured, would charge the jury that the law was<br>  unconstitutional, I they so believed, but after all, it belonged to the people<br>  to determine whether one of them had been guilty of a crime. Each one of the<br>  jury must be satisfied for himself alone, that a crime has been committed. He<br>  flattered himself that he should be able to lead them to the conclusion that<br>  the law in question was a violation of the constitution of this State and of<br>  the United States. The constitution of the United States was the highest power<br>  known in our land. Beyond that, no Legislature can go and if the jury find the<br>  law not to stand well with the constitution they must say so.<br></p><p>  The real question for the jury to settle Mr. Ellsworth apprehended to be this:<br>  Can the Legislature of Connecticut pass a law prohibiting the citizens of<br>  other States from coming into this State, and&nbsp; there residing, to<br>  prosecute the acquisition of knowledge, in a way open to the citizens of this<br>  State. This he believed was the precise question, and it reached deep and<br>  wide—wider and deeper than was perhaps imagined. It was however claimed by his<br>  friend from Canterbury, that colored persons were not citizens, and that the<br>  provisions of the constitution, with respect to citizens of the United States,<br>  did not apply to this class of our population. The criterion of citizenship<br>  was complexion in the view of the gentleman who had preceded him. I said Mr.<br>  E., make the criterion to be either birth or naturalization. Admitting that<br>  none but white persons can be naturalized, it does not touch the question of<br>  citizenship by birth. Is it so that a person born on our soil, is not a<br>  citizen of our soil? In the days of Revolution, said Mr. E., these men fought<br>  side by side with our fathers, and shed their blood for their country—the<br>  country to which they owed indefeasible allegiance. Their names were now<br>  inscribed on the Pension Rolls of the Government—they now received the<br>  honorable trophies of the services they had rendered. Where, said Mr. E., does<br>  the gentleman get the doctrine that the rights of man, as a citizen, depend<br>  upon his color? A colored man could appeal to the laws for the protection of<br>  his rights in ever State could he, if he were not a citizen? (Mr. E. here read<br>  a few sentences from the commencement of the declaration of independence,<br>  which, he said, according to the argument of the gentleman opposed to him,<br>  ought to be changed so as to have the words “except black people” introduced<br>  between each clause,) Mr. E. said he was a republican, he claimed to be as<br>  much a republican as his friend from Canterbury, and he hoped that his friend<br>  was not so ashamed of his republicanism, as to wish this instrument, the<br>  Declaration of Independence, interpolated in this manner. Our own<br>  constitution, continued Mr. E., recognized, in express terms, equality of<br>  rights—that men were equal in rights, but to this the gentleman would add<br>  “except black men.” He hoped he should not live long enough to see such<br>  doctrine go forth from Connecticut. The free colored population has, and is<br>  justly entitled, to equal representation in the Congress of the United States<br>  with the white population. Could not a black man commit treason? The gentleman<br>  would have it that he could not, for none other than citizens can. (Mr. E.<br>  here read from the 2<br>  <sup>nd</sup>  Kent’s Com on the subject of citizenship, by birth.) I scout the idea, said<br>  Mr. E., that a man, born here by the side of me, is not a citizen because, his<br>  father was black, while I am a citizen because mine was white.<br></p><p>  [The remainder of Mr. Ellsworth’s argument next week together with those of<br>  Messrs. Strong and Welch.]<br></p>

        <dd><p>FROM THE BROOKLYN UNIONIST, AUGUST 29.</p><p>TRIAL OF MISS PRUDENCE CRANDALL.</p><p>Windham County ss. County Court August term A.D. 1833.</p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; State of<br>  Connecticut<br></p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>  <em>    vs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>  </em>  information on the Statute, &amp;c.<br></p><p>Prudence Crandall</p><p>  Miss Crandall was originally brought before Rufus Adams, Esq. a Justice of the<br>  Peace for Windham County, by a warrant issued by him on a complaint by the<br>  Grand Juror of the town of Canterbury, charging her with violating a statute<br>  law of the State of Connecticut passed at the last session of the Legislature<br>  in regard to teaching, boarding, harboring, &amp;c. persons of color, not<br>  inhabitants of the State. She entered a demurrer to the complaint, the Court<br>  judged the complaint sufficient and thereupon ordered Miss Crandall to give<br>  bond with surety in the sum of $150, for her appearance before the next County<br>  Court to be tried on said complaint, and abide the judgment of said Court<br>  thereon. Failing to procure bonds, she was committed to prison. The cause came<br>  on for trial before the County Court on Friday, August 23d: C.F. Cleaveland,<br>  Esq. the Attorney for the State, being absent from indisposition, the Court<br>  appointed Jonathan A. Welch, Esq. special attorney to conduct the prosecution.<br>  A.T. Judson and I. Bulkley, Esqrs. were associate counsel.&nbsp; Hon. Calvin<br>  Goddard, Hon. W. W. Ellsworth and Henry Strong, Esq. appeared for the defence.<br>  The jury being empannelled and sworn, the counsel for the defence objected to<br>  one of the jurors from Canterbury on the ground that he had signed petitions,<br>  &amp;c. in respect to Miss Crandall’s school, and taken active measures to put<br>  it down. The Court sustained the objection, and the juror was excused. They<br>  also objected to another of the jurors on the ground that he was a member of<br>  the Legislature which passed the law, was one of those who voted for it, and<br>  had, of course, formed an opinion with respect to its constitutionality. The<br>  Court decided that the juror was competent to sit. (He got excused, however,<br>  on account of sickness.) The information against Miss Crandall consisted of<br>  two counts. The first charged “that the said Prudence Crandall, on the 24<br>  <sup>th</sup>  day of June last, with force, and arms, in a certain school which before that<br>  time had been and then was set up in said Canterbury, for the instruction and<br>  teaching of colored persons, to wit: Theodosia De Grasse, Ann Peterson, Amelia<br>  Elizabeth Wilder, Ann Eliza Hammond, and others whose names are unknown, who<br>  at the time so taught and instructed were not inhabitants of any town in this<br>  state, which said acts were done, by the said Prudence Crandall, without the<br>  consent, in writing, first had and obtained of a majority of the civil<br>  authority and select men of the said town of Canterbury, within which said<br>  school was then instructed, against the peace of this state, and contrary to<br>  the form and effect of the statute in such case made and provided.”<br></p><p>  The second count charged “that the defendant, with force and arms did wilfully<br>  and knowingly harbor and board, and aid and assist in harboring and boarding<br>  certain colored persons (named above,) who, when so harbored and boarded, were<br>  not inhabitants of any town in this State—without the consent in writing of<br>  the civil authority and select men, &amp;c.”<br></p><p>Plea, Not Guilty.</p><p>The following witnesses were then called on the part of the prosecution.</p><p>  <em>Asahel Bacon</em>  said that he had called at Miss Crandall’s house in the month of June last,<br>  having heard that she had taken some scholars from abroad. Capt. Sanger<br>  accompanied him. They were both select men of the town. Miss Crandall invited<br>  them into her house very politely. They asked her in relation to her scholars.<br>  She said she had four who were from New York and one from Hartford.—She called<br>  them in and introduced them. Theodosia De Grass, Amelia Elizabeth Wildes, and<br>  Catherine Ann Weldon, he thinks were the names of those called. Witness did<br>  not remember the day of the month that he called—thinks it was the day after<br>  the girls came—certainly soon after.<br></p><p>  <em>Ebenezer Sanger</em>  coincided in the statement of Mr. Bacon.<br></p><p>  <em>George Cady</em>  had conversed with Miss Crandall—went to her house on Friday last to summon as<br>  witnesses to support this prosecution, some of the girls who were attending<br>  the school. One of those named in this subpoena said that she had been sent<br>  for him, on account of the sickness of her mother, and wished him to excuse<br>  her attendance at Court—told her that he could not, but would state the<br>  circumstances to the public prosecutor. Miss Crandall said that she did not<br>  see that there was any need of witnesses at all, for she should confess that<br>  she had broken the law.<br></p><p>  <em>Ann Peterson,</em>  This witness was a colored girl, said to be a pupil of Miss Crandall, and was<br>  one of those named in the information to whom Miss C. had given instruction.<br>  Mr. Ellsworth objected to the examination of the witness on the ground that<br>  she could not testify without implicating herself. Mr. Welch read the clause<br>  of the statute under which this prosecution was sustained, in which it was<br>  enacted that the pupils in a school kept contrary to the act, might be<br>  compelled to testify. Mr. Ellsworth said that he denied, altogether, the<br>  competency of the Legislature to compel a witness to testify, or answer<br>  questions that might implicate him, even to render himself liable in<br>  debt—otherwise a witness might be compelled to testify to what would charge<br>  him with the crime of murder. He alluded to the State Constitution and Bill or<br>  Rights which he claimed protected every person from criminating himself by<br>  being compelled to give testimony. It was contrary to fundamental principles.<br>  In this case the witness might make herself an aider and abettor, and subject<br>  herself to the penalties imposed by the statute. Mr. Judson claimed that the<br>  witness would not by her testimony implicate herself. The law was penal, and<br>  must be construed strictly. Even if she was aware that she was instructed by<br>  Miss Crandall, it would not charge herself with any crime. Mr. Judson read at<br>  length from Starkie on evidence, to show that the witness ought, on common law<br>  principles, to be examined, and was bound to answer questions as to what she<br>  knew of Miss C.’s school. At all events he claimed that, in this instance,<br>  such must be the case as the Legislature had expressly enacted that the pupils<br>  should be witnesses. Mr. Ellsworth, in reply, said he apprehended the question<br>  to be whether the Legislature possessed the power to compel a witness to<br>  convict himself. He read from the opinion of Chief Justice Hosmer, in the 8<br>  <sup>th</sup>  Con. Rep. and also from the case of the people vs. Mather, in 4<br>  <sup>th</sup>  Wendell’s Reps on the subject of examining witnesses.&nbsp; By the principles<br>  decided these cases, which were the settled law of the land, he claimed that<br>  the witness was not compelled to answer any questions in relation to her<br>  knowledge of this school. The Court decided that the witness, under the<br>  circumstances, was not protected, but must be examined.—The examination was<br>  about to proceed, when Mr. Ellsworth rose and stated to the Court that the<br>  witness had been advised not to answer interrogatories in regard to her<br>  knowledge of this school. He felt it to be his duty now to repeat this advice.<br>  He wished the Court, however, distinctly to understand that the counsel for<br>  the accused had taken this course not with a view to embarrass the trial, but<br>  solely from a sense of duty. He conscientiously believed that the legal rights<br>  of the witness were such that she should not be compelled to testify. The<br>  Counsel for the prosecution, asked the witness when she came to Canterbury,<br>  but she declined answering the question. A number of other questions were then<br>  proposed to the witness, the principal of which were—“Has Miss Crandall kept a<br>  school for colored girls not inhabitants of this state?”—“Will you say whether<br>  the defendant has or has not instructed any person of color other than<br>  yourself since the 10<br>  <sup>th</sup>  of June last, or boarded and instructed colored persons not inhabitants of<br>  this state?” To all these and other questions of a similar character, the<br>  witness decline giving an answer, on the ground that she could not do so<br>  without criminating herself. The counsel for the prosecution then called<br>  <em>Catherine Ann Weldon</em>  and<br>  <em>Eliza Hammond,</em>  both girls of color, and charged with being pupils of Miss Crandall, and<br>  propounded to them the same questions as above; but they for the same reason,<br>  and by the advice of counsel, declined answering. The prosecuting Attorney<br>  reserved to himself, though he waived for the present, the right of moving for<br>  an order that these witnesses be committed for a contempt of court.<br></p><p>  <em>Jacob C. Gould</em>  said he was acquainted with Ann Eliza Hammond. She belonged to Providence R.I.<br>  had known her since she was a child—was the daughter of Thomas Hammond, who<br>  died in 1826. Her mother now lived in Providence—the father at his death was<br>  worth from 1500 to $2000 in real estate.<br></p><p>  <em>Levi Kneeland,</em>  Was not connected with Miss Crandall’s school except as an adviser in relation<br>  to it—was pastor of the Church to which Miss Crandall belonged—had seen<br>  several of the colored girls who were present at his church during the summer.<br>  In reply to a question whether he had seen one of the girls elsewhere than at<br>  his church declined answering. In reply to the question whether he had not<br>  seen one of them at Miss Crandall’s, declined answering—decline to answer<br>  whether he had advised Miss Crandall in relation to her school. Declined<br>  answering whether or not he had been in Miss Crandall’s school since the 10<br>  <sup>th</sup>  of June last. The court, having decided that he was bound to answer the<br>  questions put to him, and that the reasons he offered for refusing to do so,<br>  namely, that he might subject himself to a prosecution, and entangle himself<br>  in difficulties, were insufficient, granted a motion for a mittimus to commit<br>  him to prison and he was taken into custody by the Sheriff.<br></p><p>  <em>Eliza Parkis</em>  (a woman of color) was acquainted with Ann Eliza Hammond, one of the girls<br>  that Miss Crandall was charged with having instructed. Has seen her in<br>  Providence—has also seen her at Miss Crandall’s, and slept in a room with Miss<br>  De Grasse a colored girl from New York. Miss Crandall employed witness to work<br>  for her, because she said she did not wish to keep her scholars out of school<br>  to do the work. Never saw any of the girls in school.—Have seen them have<br>  books and study them.<br></p><p>  <em>Rowland Greene</em>  (affirmed) Has often heard that Miss Crandall kept a school for colored girls<br>  in Canterbury—has been at the house often, was called as a physician—went<br>  there and saw several colored girls—heard some of them recite in grammar,<br>  geography, &amp;c. Some of the girls has been at his own house. Has seen a<br>  little girl there, said to be from New York—has heard Miss Crandall talk<br>  concerning her scholars from abroad—does not recollect to have heard her say<br>  that they were from New York.<br></p><p>  <em>Mr. Kneeland</em>  was not placed at the bar by the Sheriff at his request, and said he intended<br>  no disrespect to the Court by declining to answer the interrogatories put to<br>  him, and being advised that he should not implicate himself by doing so, he<br>  was ready to answer. He proceeded to state that he had visited Miss Crandall’s<br>  school twice. Once it was under the charge of another person. He had prayed in<br>  the school and conversed with the girls on religious subjects—does not<br>  remember faces as well as people in general—could not therefore positively<br>  identify any one of those present as being the ones seen at Miss<br>  Crandall’s—should think they were—his best belief on the subject would be a<br>  guess—has taken meals at Miss Crandall’s and eaten with her pupils—has heard<br>  them recite their lessons—thinks he has heard Miss Hammond spoken of either by<br>  the defendant or her sister. Miss Crandall has conversed with him in relation<br>  to her scholars—thinks she has told him that some of them were from New York,<br>  and some from Providence and New-Haven.<br></p><p>  <em>Albert Hinckley,</em>  has been at Miss Crandall’s several times since the month of June last—does<br>  not know whether he has been in her school room as he knows not in which room<br>  it is kept, has not conversed with her on the subject of the residence of her<br>  scholars—called on her as a friend and conversed on various topics—has heard<br>  that she kept a school for colored persons—has heard her speak of her scholars<br>  and school—has seen colored ladies at her house and has taken tea with<br>  them—cannot say whether any of those present were the ones or not.<br></p><p>  <em>Eliza Glasko,</em>  This witness was a colored girl belonging to the school but an inhabitant of<br>  this state. The same objection was made to examining her as was before made in<br>  respect to the others, but the objection was overruled by the Court. She<br>  however declined answering the questions propounded to her. The prosecuting<br>  attorney moved the court for a mittimus to commit the witness for contempt of<br>  court. The court granted the motion and ordered the clerk to make out a<br>  mittimus.<br></p><p>  <em>Hezekiah Crandall,</em>  (affirmed) His sister Prudence keeps a school at Canterbury for colored<br>  girls—knows Ann Eliza Hammond—could not certainly recognize any other that was<br>  present except perhaps Ann Peterson—has never been in the school nor heard the<br>  pupils recite—has seen Ann Eliza Hammond at his sisters, often, during June<br>  and July,—supposed she boarded there and was instructed by his sisters with<br>  others—knows by sight and name Amelia Wildes—does not know where she is<br>  now—has not heard his sister say any thing on the subject of her school for<br>  some time—she has resided in Canterbury some portion of the time for twelve<br>  years past.<br></p><p>  <em>James Chandler</em>  said he was at Miss Crandall’s several times last spring (not being able to<br>  say with certainty whether he had been there since the passage of the law he<br>  was not interrogated farther.)<br></p><p>  <em>George Roberts</em>  went to Miss Crandall’s about five months ag and carried a colored girl, Miss<br>  Hammond to the school—Miss Hammond it was said belonged to Providence, has<br>  been at Miss C’s since that time perhaps within ten weeks and drank tea—he<br>  then saw Miss Hammond but does not know whether she boarded there constantly<br>  or not—he heard her and other colored girls recite in Miss Crandall’s<br>  school—should think this was two or three months ago—has been at Miss C’s<br>  within a week but did not as he remembers see any of the girls present there<br>  at that time.<br></p><p>  <em>Mary Benson</em>  (affirmed) Has been at Miss Crandall’s school and found it very<br>  interesting—was never present but for a short time—‘tis for colored<br>  persons—saw Ann Eliza Hammond there—she is one of the scholars and boards with<br>  Miss C.—Witness recognized several of those present as among the number she<br>  had seen at Miss Crandall’s—one of the pupils, Ann Weldon was from<br>  New-York—Miss Hammond was from Providence—witness was at Miss Crandall’s five<br>  weeks since and took tea—several colored girls were at the table—does not know<br>  where any of them belonged except by report—visited the school when it was<br>  near closing and heard Miss C. give the girls instruction in Geography and<br>  Arithmetic. The prosecuting Attorney here rested his evidence, and the sheriff<br>  having served his process on Eliza Glasko was about committing her to prison,<br>  when Mr. Ellsworth interposed and stated to the court that rather than have<br>  the girl committed he should advise her to testify—again repeating that the<br>  course of the defendant’s counsel in relation to the testimony of these girls,<br>  was dictated by an imperious sense of professional duty.<br></p><p>  <em>Eliza Glasko</em>  the proceeded to give testimony. She said she was a member of Miss C’s school,<br>  and that the other girls near her were also members—one of them from<br>  Providence, the other said to be from New-York—the ordinary branches were<br>  taught them by Miss C.—reading, writing, grammar, geography, &amp;c., witness<br>  begun to go on the first of April—the school was usually opened and closed<br>  with prayer—the scriptures were read and explained daily in the school—some<br>  portions were committed to memory by the pupils and considered a part of their<br>  education.<br></p><p>Mr. Judson then opened the case on the part of the prosecution.</p><p>  He first stated the case and read the Act of the Legislature which he claimed<br>  that Miss Crandall had violated. He said that this act did not prevent any<br>  black from attending the district schools in the State, or any higher<br>  schools—that they had all the benefits of the school und, and might attend the<br>  academies, high schools, or colleges, and that too whether they were citizens<br>  of this state, of other states, or of any part of the world. The sole<br>  intention and provision of the act was, that colored persons, from another<br>  jurisdiction, should not be intruded into any town in this state, without a<br>  written permission from the select men and civil authority of the town in<br>  which they proposed to reside. This was all, and this was perfectly lawful.<br>  The whole tenor and effect of the law was to place a school for colored<br>  persons under the care and supervision of the select men and civil authority<br>  of each town. He should ask the attention of the Court to the face that the<br>  Legislature had exercised a controlling power over schools within the limits<br>  of the state since 1717. (Mr. Judson here read from an old edition of the<br>  statutes, in respect to the power which the Legislature had exercised over<br>  schools in respect to preventing disorders and the application of the public<br>  money.)—These said Mr. Judson, were schools for the instruction of all<br>  classes, and the acts which he had read, showed that the Legislature thought<br>  proper to exercise care over these schools. Such was the ancient policy of the<br>  state, and this new law was no change of policy. The state owed its present<br>  honors, its present glories, to pursuing this policy of keepings its schools<br>  under a supervising power. Nor was there anything in the Constitution of the<br>  United States to prevent it. Towns, he claimed, had a right to say who should<br>  be allowed to become inhabitants be residence in their limits and this law<br>  gave them no more power than was necessary for the exercise of that right.<br>  That the law was illiberal and reflected disgrace on the State, on the<br>  Legislature which enacted it, he denied. On the contrary, said Mr. J., there<br>  are now more than 1500 schools in the state, supported by our fund of<br>  $1,800,000, to which blacks may go without the payment of a cent. Small as the<br>  state was, smaller than single counties in some other states, these facts were<br>  true concerning it. For himself he was proud of it. Where could a parallel be<br>  found in the universe?<br></p><p>  Public policy, continued Mr. J., absolutely demands that a law of this<br>  description should be maintained. It was claimed to be unconstitutional<br>  because exclusive in its operation on a particular class. Other laws of the<br>  state were liable to the same objection. Physicians and lawyers were instances<br>  of the operation of our exclusive law. Tanners, Taverners, Surveyors, &amp;c.<br>  must all be licensed. Manufactories were liable to be visited by the select<br>  men and civil authority for the purpose of seeing that the children employed<br>  in them were properly educated. If persons came here from other states and set<br>  up manufacturing establishments they were equally liable to be visited in this<br>  way though no such provisions existed in the laws of the states from whence<br>  they come. Lawyers in this state could not purchase choses (??) in action. All<br>  these laws, with many similar ones, were passed in derogation of rights<br>  originally common to all; public policy however, required the enactment of<br>  them, as it did of the one in question, and in his opinion they all stood on<br>  similar grounds, and were, without question, in accordance with the<br>  Constitution.<br></p><p>  Mr. J. next referred to the course which other states had pursued in<br>  legislating on the subject of the blacks. He remarked on the law of Ohio. Our<br>  law is not, said Mr. J., an act of exclusion, nor an act of prohibition. It<br>  does not pretend to send away those who belong here, nor does it prohibit any<br>  from coming, but only makes it necessary that permission be first obtained.<br>  The laws of Georgia and North Carolina went so far as to authorise the<br>  imprisonment of blacks who came within their limits, even though they came in<br>  the capacity of cooks and stewards of vessels. In Tennessee blacks could not<br>  come from other states and remain within the state above twelve days without<br>  incurring penalties. In Maryland a man could not manumit his slave without his<br>  leaving the state. Even in Pennsylvania, “the land of Penn,” no free negro<br>  could remain without giving bonds for his support. All these laws Mr. J.<br>  claimed to be obnoxious to equal and indeed to greater constitutional<br>  objections than the one in question. The article in the constitution of the<br>  United States with which this law was supposed to conflict, he understood to<br>  be, the 2d section of the 4<br>  <sup>th</sup>  article:—“The citizens of each state shall be entitled to all the privileges<br>  and immunities of citizens in the several states.” Mr. J. claimed that the<br>  term “citizens” in this place, and throughout the constitution, had a<br>  technical signification—a legal meaning—that it did not include colored<br>  persons—that they were not be the constitution recognized as citizens. A<br>  certain class of colored persons, slaves) were in it considered as property.<br></p><p>  Mr. J. here referred to the laws of the United State on the subject of<br>  naturalization, reading from Ingersoll’s Digest, the several acts of Congress,<br>  and insisted that from them all, the language being precise, technical, and<br>  certain, none other than white persons could be naturalized citizens of the<br>  United States. He also read from the 2<br>  <sup>nd</sup>  Kent’s Com. 70, 71, 72, by which he further illustrated these views.<br></p><p>  There have been, continued Mr. J., concurrent acts of the State of Connecticut<br>  which give the same construction to the constitution. If “citizen” do not mean<br>  a white person only—if it be claimed that a black is a citizen, then is the<br>  constitution of our own State a nullity, for it allows “free white males”<br>  alone to be electors. The privilege of being a freeman, he claimed, to be a<br>  higher one that the right of being educated. Why should a man be educated who<br>  could not be a freeman? A person who pays a single cent State tax, or who does<br>  military duty, is entitled to the privilege of voting. In Massachusetts these<br>  qualifications were not sufficient. Each state in the Union has these local<br>  laws and customs peculiar to itself—these must all be abrogated at a blow, by<br>  deciding the law in question to be unconstitutional. Full effect however,<br>  might be given to the clause in the constitution, referred to without<br>  producing this result, and that was, by construing the term “citizen” in the<br>  manner he had before pointed out.<br></p><p>  The first act in our own statute would be nullified by a decision that this<br>  law was unconstitutional—a citizen of another State cannot maintain an action<br>  in our courts for any cause unless a substantial inhabitant of the State give<br>  bond for him. No one has doubted the constitutionality of this law, and the<br>  law in question, with respect to constitutionality, could not be distinguished<br>  from it.<br></p><p>  Mr. J. said he should conclude his remarks on this subject by alluding merely<br>  to one other argument in support of this law, and that was, that the public<br>  safety of this State, the preservation of its true interests, required this<br>  law to be enforced. The southern States might emancipate their slaves and send<br>  them all to Connecticut instead of Liberia. The influx of that species of<br>  population might be so great as to be overwhelming. (Mr. J. proceeded to<br>  remark on the effect which recent measures of the British Parliament, on the<br>  subject of slavery, might have on this question, when he was interrupted by<br>  the court, who remarked that tho’ far from inclined to restrain all the limits<br>  of the discussion, yet it did not seem pertinent to the issue to argue the<br>  policy or expediency of the laws. Mr. J. said he would not press the point.)<br>  Mr. J. hoped that he had not been misunderstood in the remarks he had made. He<br>  wished not to oppress any class of population. He heartily wished that every<br>  slave might be emancipated that every day. But if it could not be done without<br>  destruction to our constitutions, and desolating our land, he could not desire<br>  it.<br></p><p>  He would only add to the Jury that though it was true they were at liberty to<br>  consider what the court said to them on the subject of the law, as advice,<br>  still he hoped they would pay it such respect as advice from the bench was<br>  properly entitled to. A single word as to the facts. The information charged<br>  the defendant with boarding and instructing, in different counts. It was<br>  sufficient if they found her guilty on either. The day was immaterial. If they<br>  found her guilty of doing the act charged on any day, since the passage of the<br>  law, and before the filing of the information, ‘twas sufficient. It was not<br>  necessary that they should find that she had boarded or instructed each of the<br>  persons named in the information; to instruct or board one was a transgression<br>  of the law.<br></p><p>As to the proof it was abundant, conclusive.</p><p>  Mr. Ellsworth, after stating the case, and remarking on the prohibitions of<br>  the law, said that he proposed not to occupy time in relation to the facts of<br>  the case. He would willingly have advised the pupils of Miss Crandall to have<br>  testified had he not believed that in so doing they voluntarily surrendered<br>  their most sacred rights. True it was, the defendant has kept this<br>  school—‘twas no secret, and whether that constituted a crime or not was for<br>  the jury to determine. In order to convict my client, said Mr. E., you<br>  gentlemen, must find on your oaths that she had committed a crime. You may<br>  find that she has violated an act of the State Legislature, but if you also<br>  find her protected by a higher power, it will be your duty to acquit. The<br>  court he was fully assured, would charge the jury that the law was<br>  unconstitutional, I they so believed, but after all, it belonged to the people<br>  to determine whether one of them had been guilty of a crime. Each one of the<br>  jury must be satisfied for himself alone, that a crime has been committed. He<br>  flattered himself that he should be able to lead them to the conclusion that<br>  the law in question was a violation of the constitution of this State and of<br>  the United States. The constitution of the United States was the highest power<br>  known in our land. Beyond that, no Legislature can go and if the jury find the<br>  law not to stand well with the constitution they must say so.<br></p><p>  The real question for the jury to settle Mr. Ellsworth apprehended to be this:<br>  Can the Legislature of Connecticut pass a law prohibiting the citizens of<br>  other States from coming into this State, and&nbsp; there residing, to<br>  prosecute the acquisition of knowledge, in a way open to the citizens of this<br>  State. This he believed was the precise question, and it reached deep and<br>  wide—wider and deeper than was perhaps imagined. It was however claimed by his<br>  friend from Canterbury, that colored persons were not citizens, and that the<br>  provisions of the constitution, with respect to citizens of the United States,<br>  did not apply to this class of our population. The criterion of citizenship<br>  was complexion in the view of the gentleman who had preceded him. I said Mr.<br>  E., make the criterion to be either birth or naturalization. Admitting that<br>  none but white persons can be naturalized, it does not touch the question of<br>  citizenship by birth. Is it so that a person born on our soil, is not a<br>  citizen of our soil? In the days of Revolution, said Mr. E., these men fought<br>  side by side with our fathers, and shed their blood for their country—the<br>  country to which they owed indefeasible allegiance. Their names were now<br>  inscribed on the Pension Rolls of the Government—they now received the<br>  honorable trophies of the services they had rendered. Where, said Mr. E., does<br>  the gentleman get the doctrine that the rights of man, as a citizen, depend<br>  upon his color? A colored man could appeal to the laws for the protection of<br>  his rights in ever State could he, if he were not a citizen? (Mr. E. here read<br>  a few sentences from the commencement of the declaration of independence,<br>  which, he said, according to the argument of the gentleman opposed to him,<br>  ought to be changed so as to have the words “except black people” introduced<br>  between each clause,) Mr. E. said he was a republican, he claimed to be as<br>  much a republican as his friend from Canterbury, and he hoped that his friend<br>  was not so ashamed of his republicanism, as to wish this instrument, the<br>  Declaration of Independence, interpolated in this manner. Our own<br>  constitution, continued Mr. E., recognized, in express terms, equality of<br>  rights—that men were equal in rights, but to this the gentleman would add<br>  “except black men.” He hoped he should not live long enough to see such<br>  doctrine go forth from Connecticut. The free colored population has, and is<br>  justly entitled, to equal representation in the Congress of the United States<br>  with the white population. Could not a black man commit treason? The gentleman<br>  would have it that he could not, for none other than citizens can. (Mr. E.<br>  here read from the 2<br>  <sup>nd</sup>  Kent’s Com on the subject of citizenship, by birth.) I scout the idea, said<br>  Mr. E., that a man, born here by the side of me, is not a citizen because, his<br>  father was black, while I am a citizen because mine was white.<br></p><p>  [The remainder of Mr. Ellsworth’s argument next week together with those of<br>  Messrs.
