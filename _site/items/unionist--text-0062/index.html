    <p>  (We extract the following from Professor Wright’s pamphlet, entitled “The Sin<br>  of Slavery, and its Remedy.)<br></p><p>  The American revolution was incomplete. It left one sixth part of the<br>  population the victims of a servitude immeasurably more debasing, than that<br>  from which it delivered the rest. While this nation held up its declaration of<br>  independence—its noble bill of human rights, before an admiring world, in one<br>  hand; it mortified the friends of humanity, by oppressing the poor and<br>  defenceless with the other. The progress of time has not lessened the evil.<br>  There are now held in involuntary and perpetual slavery, in the southern half<br>  of this republic, more than 2,000,000 of men, women, and children, guarded<br>  with a vigilance, which strives, and with success appalling as it is complete,<br>  to shut out every ray of knowledge, human and divine, and reduce them as<br>  nearly as possible to a level with the brutes. These miserable slaves are not<br>  only compelled to labor without choice and without hire, but they are<br>  subjected to the cruelty and lust of their masters to an unbounded extent. I<br>  the northern states there is very generally a sympathy with the slave-holders,<br>  and a prejudice against the slaves, which shows itself in palliating the crime<br>  of slave-holding, and in most unrighteously disregarding the rights, and<br>  vilifying the characters of the free colored men.<br></p><p>  At the same time, slavery, as a system, is (in a certain sense) condemned. It<br>  is confessed to be a great evil, “a moral evil,” and, when the point is urged,<br>  <em>a sin.</em>  The slaves, it is admitted, have rights—every principle of honesty, justice,<br>  and humanity,<br>  <em>“in the abstract,”</em>  calls aloud that they should be made free. The word of God is in their favour.<br>  Indeed, there is no ground claimed by the abettors of slavery, on which they<br>  pretend to justify it for a moment, but a supposed—a begged—<br>  <em>expediency,</em>  baseless as the driven clouds. I say baseless, for while not a single fact has<br>  ever been produced, going to show the danger of putting the slaves, all at<br>  once, under the protection of law, and employing them as free laborers, there<br>  have been produced, on the other side, varied and fair experiments showing,<br>  that it is altogether safe and profitable.<br></p><p>  In this state of things where had the American church stood? Has she too<br>  sympathized with the hearts of the Pharaohs? Or has she in the spirit of the<br>  martyrs of former times, borne an unflinching testimony against this sin?<br>  Alas! The painful truth stares us in the face. She has come down from the high<br>  and firm foundation of scripture truth, and is professedly at work upon a<br>  floating<br>  <em>expediency,</em>  doing against slavery what cab be done upon the checked current of popular<br>  prejudice.—Speaking through the organ of the Colonization Society, she has<br>  admitted all that the most determined slave-holder could ask, and she is doing<br>  just that, and no more, which so far as he understands the subject, he hails<br>  with pleasure as a safeguard to is property in human bodies and<br>  <em>souls.</em>  This is the testimony of slave-holders themselves—most competent witnesses.<br></p><p>  Is further evidence needed? When the American Colonization Society, as a<br>  remedy for slavery, has been called in question, as well it might be for its<br>  tardiness, if for no other reason, there has been manifested a determination<br>  to hush inquiry. There has been a most pusillanimous shivering and shrinking<br>  from the probe. Nay, the few men who, in the uncompromising spirit of<br>  Christian benevolence, have urged this inquiry, have been slandered as<br>  disturbers of the public peace,—have been assailed with abusive epithets, not<br>  be slave-holders only, but by their brethren in the bosom of the church.<br></p><p>  A most singular spectacle is presented in this enlightened and Christian age;<br>  a handful of philanthropists, dare denounce a system of legalized oppression,<br>  and to charge guilt upon all who uphold it; upon this, not only do the<br>  principals in crime, as might be expected, ascribe the whole to sheer malice,<br>  but the leaders of the Christian church, as ought not to be expected, endorse,<br>  and give currency to the charge, and throw the whole weight of their cold and<br>  crushing influence to smother in its cradle this attempt at a gospel<br>  reformation.<br></p><p>  What does all this mean? Are Christians in these northern states interested in<br>  upholding slavery? Are they unwilling to be convinced that their colored<br>  brethren are better than the slanders of their oppressors would make them? Are<br>  they sure, beyond a doubt, that the colonization scheme will relieve our<br>  country of the might evil which is crushing it? that it is the<br>  <em>Christian</em>  way to relieve it? Are they on good evidence convinced that it is not<br>  <em>expedient</em>  to say to the wicked, “O wicked man, thou shalt surely die?” Must they have<br>  PEACE at any rate—peace, though the groans of millions should ascend and<br>  mingle with the muttering thunders of coming wrath? Will they have it, that if<br>  a word is said against a mere experiment to test the practicability of<br>  rescuing the victim by flattering the oppressor, the whole cause of Christian<br>  benevolence is attacked? If not, why not welcome inquiry? A thorough<br>  investigation—a looking on<br>  <em>both sides,</em>  would surely do no harm. Those defenders of truth who have shunned such<br>  inquiry, have always proved themselves short-sighted. The cause of God courts<br>  scrutiny—its advocates are thrown into no unseemly agitation when they are<br>  most rigorously sifted.<br></p><p>  The subject cries aloud for more earnest consideration than it has yet<br>  received. More than two millions of outraged, downtrodden men cry out, shall<br>  we die in this sore bondage that white Christians may have the pleasure of<br>  attempting to shun God’s wrath without repenting of sin?—Half a million of<br>  free colored men cry out—America is our country—the land for which<br>  <em>our</em>  fathers bled as well as yours. Why will you seek to banish us? The wrongs of<br>  the poor Indian cry aloud, There is no safety in league with transgressors!<br>  The present political aspect of the South [cries out, that tyrants do not<br>  regard law! Six hundred millions of idolaters cry out to the American church,<br>  “Why pluckest thou the mote out of thy brother’s eye, and behold a beam is in<br>  thine own!”<br></p>
