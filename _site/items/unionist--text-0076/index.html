    <p align="center">DREADFUL EFFECTS OF IMMEDIATE EMANCIPATION</p><p align="center">[From a pamphlet recently published in England.}</p><p>  Of the many persons who declare themselves averse to slavery and yet afraid to<br>  join in measures for its abolition, some perhaps have not paid much attention<br>  to the instances of emancipation that have already taken place. If any such<br>  will take the trouble to read the following account of the effects of<br>  emancipation as far as it has hitherto been tried, they will perhaps see that<br>  their fears on the subject are not justified by experience.<br></p><p>  The History of Hayti when separated from the accidental circumstances<br>  attending it, furnishes irrefragable evidence of the safety and advantage of<br>  immediate emancipation. It is true that much blood was shed there during the<br>  French revolution; but this was not owing to the emancipation of the slaves,<br>  but was the consequence either of the civil war which preceded the act of<br>  emancipation; or of the atrocious attempt to restore slavery.<br></p><p>  In September, 1793, Polvirel, one of the Commissioners sent to St. Domingo by<br>  the National Convention, issues a proclamation declaring the whole of the<br>  slaves in the island free. Colonel Malenfant, a slave proprietor, resident at<br>  the time in the island, thus describes the effects of this sudden measure.<br>  “After this public act of emancipation, the Negroes remained quiet both in the<br>  south and in the west, and they continued to work upon all the plantations.<br>  There were estates which had neither owners nor managers resident upon them,<br>  and on those estates where no white men were left to direct them, they betook<br>  themselves to the planting of provisions; but upon all plantations where the<br>  whites resided, the blacks continued to labor as quietly as before.” Colonel<br>  Malenfant says, that when many of his neighbors, proprietors or managers, were<br>  in prison, the negroes of their plantations came to him to beg him to direct<br>  them in their work. “If you will take care not to talk to them of the<br>  restoration of slavery, but talk to them of freedom, you may with this word<br>  chain them down to their labor. How did Toussaint succeed?—How did I succeed<br>  before is time in the plain of the Culde-Sac on the plantation Gourand, during<br>  more than eight months after liberty had been granted to the slaves? Let those<br>  who knew me at that time, let the blacks themselves, be asked: they will all<br>  reply that not a single negro upon that plantation, consisting of more than<br>  four hundred and fifty laborers, refused to work: and yet this plantation was<br>  thought to be under the worst discipline and the slaves the most idle of any<br>  in the plain. I inspired the same activity into three other plantations of<br>  which I had the management. I all the negroes had come from Africa within six<br>  months, if they had the love of independence that the Indians have, I should<br>  own that force must be employed; but ninety-nine out of a hundred of the<br>  blacks are aware that without labor they cannot procure the things that are<br>  necessary for them; that there is no other method of satisfying their wants<br>  and their tastes. They know that they must work; the wish to do so, and they<br>  will do so.”<br></p><p>  Such was the conduct of the negroes for the first nine months after their<br>  liberation, or up to the middle of 1794. In the latter part of 1796, Malenfant<br>  says, “The colony was flourishing under Toussaint, the whites lived happily<br>  and in peace upon their estates, and the negroes continued to work for them”<br>  General Lecroix who published his “Memoirs for a history of St. Domingo” in<br>  1819, says that in 1797 the most wonderful progress had been made in<br>  agriculture. “The Colony,” said he, “marched as by enchantment towards its<br>  ancient splendor: cultivation prospered; every day produced perceptible proof<br>  of its progress.” General Vincent, who was a general of brigade of artillery<br>  in St. Domingo and a proprietor of estates in the island, was sent by<br>  Toussaint to Paris in 1801 to lay before the Directory the new constitution<br>  which had been agreed upon in St. Domingo. He arrived in France just at the<br>  moment of the peace of Amiens, and found that Bonaparte was preparing an<br>  armament for the purpose of restoring slavery in St. Domingo. He remonstrated<br>  against the expedition; he stated that it was totally unnecessary and<br>  therefore criminal, for that every thing was going on well in St. Domingo. The<br>  proprietors were in peaceable possessions of their estates; cultivation was<br>  making rapid progress; the blacks were industrious and beyond example happy.<br>  He conjured him, therefore not to reverse this beautiful state of things, but<br>  his efforts were ineffectual, and the expedition arrived upon the shores of<br>  St. Domingo. At length, however, the French were driven from the island. Till<br>  that time the planters had retained their property, and then it was, and not<br>  till then, that they lost their all. In 1804 Dessalines was proclaimed<br>  Emperor; in process of time a great part of the black troops were disbanded,<br>  and returned to cultivation again. From that time to this, there has been no<br>  want o subordination or industry among them.<br></p><p>  The following account of the character and condition of the negroes of Hayti,<br>  at a later period, is taken from “Sketches of Hayti” by Mr. Harvey, who during<br>  the latter part of the reign of Christophe spent a considerable time at Cape<br>  François the capital of his dominions. “The cultivators who formed the great<br>  mass of the population, resided on or near the plantations of which they were<br>  appointed to labor. A great proportion of them were engaged in cultivating the<br>  estates of the king; if soldiers, they were fed and clothed at his expense; if<br>  regular cultivators, they received such a share of the produce as was fully<br>  adequate to yield them a competent maintenance. Others were in the employ of<br>  the nobles and officers, who received either stated wages or such a portion of<br>  the article they cultivated as was deemed a sufficient reward for their<br>  industry, were equally supplied with whatever could contribute to their<br>  comfort. And those who by their exertions and economy were enabled to procure<br>  small spots of land of their own or to hold the smaller plantations at an<br>  annual rent, were diligently engaged in cultivating coffee, sugar, and other<br>  articles, which they disposed of to the inhabitants of the adjacent towns and<br>  villages. It was an interesting sight to behold this class o the Haytians, now<br>  in possession of their freedom, coming in groups to the market nearest which<br>  they resided, bringing the produce of their industry for sale; and afterwards<br>  returning, carrying back the necessary articles of living which the disposal<br>  of their commodities had enabled them to purchase; all evidently cheerful and<br>  happy. Nor could it fail to occur to the mind that their present condition<br>  furnished the most satisfactory answer to that objection to the general<br>  emancipation of slaves, founded on their alleged unfitness to value and<br>  improve the benefits of liberty.<br></p><p>  Though of the same race and possessing the same general traits of character as<br>  the negroes of the other West India islands, they are already distinguished<br>  from them by habits of industry and activity such as slaves are seldom known<br>  to exhibit. As they would not suffer, so they do not require the attendance of<br>  one acting in the capacity of a driver with the instrument of punishment in<br>  his hand.—As far as I had an opportunity of ascertaining from what fell under<br>  my own observation, and from what I gathered from other European residents, I<br>  am persuaded of one general fact which on account of its importance I shall<br>  state in the most explicit terms, viz: that the Haytians employed in<br>  cultivating the plantations, as well as the rest of the population, perform as<br>  much work in a given time as they were accustomed to do during their<br>  subjection to the French. And if we may judge of their future improvement by<br>  the change which has already effected, it may be reasonably anticipated that<br>  Hayti will ere long contain a population not inferior in their industry to<br>  that of any civilized nation in the world.<br></p><p>  While the interior of this island was in this improving state, and its<br>  inhabitants were peaceful and industrious, Cape Francois and other towns<br>  presented scenes of the utmost order and activity: the great majority of the<br>  inhabitants of Cape Francois consisted of trades-people and mechanics, the<br>  former of whom were supplied by the resident merchants with cloths, linens,<br>  silks and other manufactures, which they sold to the natives in small<br>  quantities. Their business was seldom so great as to enable them to amass<br>  fortunes, but it afforded them ample means of support. Towards strangers who<br>  entered their shops, whether for the purpose of making purchases or not, they<br>  were invariably and remarkably civil; a trait in the character of Christophe’s<br>  subjects which I believe to have been universal. The mechanics, though many of<br>  them were deficient in skill from having been imperfectly instructed, were all<br>  enabled by their industry to gain a competent maintenance. On the whole, the<br>  scene which Cape Francois presented was as interesting as it was in many<br>  respects surprising. In few places of commerce could there be seen greater<br>  regularity in the despatch [sic] of business, greater diligence displayed by<br>  those engaged in it, or more evident marks of a prosperous state of things.<br>  Every man had some calling to occupy his attention; instances of idleness or<br>  intemperance were of rare occurrence, the most perfect subordination<br>  prevailed, and all appeared contented and happy. A foreigner would have found<br>  it difficult to persuade himself on his first entering the place, that the<br>  people he now beheld so submissive, industrious and contented, were the same<br>  people who a few years before has escaped from the shackles of slavery.”<br></p><p>  A gentleman who had been for upwards of twenty years past a general merchant<br>  in Hayti, frequently crossing to Europe and America, gave the following<br>  account of the condition of the Haytians to Capt. Stuart at Belfast last<br>  winter. The present population he supposes consists of at least seven hundred<br>  thousand. He said that there was very universal happiness amongst them,—and<br>  that though their conduct was not unexceptionable, yet there was a less<br>  distress, than in any other country of his knowledge. That they obtained<br>  abundance by their own labor.—There were no paupers except the decrepid [sic]<br>  and aged: that the people were very charitable, hospitable and kind, very<br>  respectful to Europeans, temperate, grateful, faithful, orderly and submissive,<br>  easily governable, lively and contented, good mechanics, and that no corporal<br>  punishments are allowed.<br></p>

     <h3>About this Item</h3>
       <p>The argument implicit in this account - that once emancipated, people of African descent will behave like Europeans, and even retain a sense of their place in the hierarchic order - was far too common in these early days of Immediate Abolition. This is, to my ears, another misstep along the road to true allyship between white Abolitionists and African-Americans. On a more positive note, the presence of Haiti as a symbol of Black achievement and independence, was always important, as is borne out in the writings of African-Americans like David Walker, Maria Stewart, and Henry Highland Garnet.</p>
