    <p align="center"><strong>MISCELLANY.</strong></p><p align="right">For the Unionist.</p><p align="center">FORGIVENESS.</p><p align="center">A TALE.</p><p align="center">_ _ _</p><p align="center">“To err, is human—to forgive, divine.”</p><p align="center">_ _ _</p><p align="center"><em>Concluded.</em></p><p>  Various were the conjectures concerning the cause of her sudden disappearance, <br>  and when at last they ventured to question Matilda, she replied with a great <br>  many signs and a few hypocritical tears, that her father had placed her under <br>  the car of his sister-in-law, the widow of an eminent physician, thinking her <br>  experience and virtuous example might be of service to Emily, that she was <br>  grieved for the cause, and wished not to be question on the subject. Thus, by <br>  her false insinuations, she deprived her of the esteem of the world—that world <br>  which will on day <br>  <em>worship</em>  and the next <br>  <em>stab</em>  you. Not contented with this, she persuaded Mr. Minnette to disinherit his <br>  daughter, and make a will in favor of the little George, but her cruelty was <br>  not to go unpunished. By some unforeseen losses in trade Mr. Minnette became <br>  bankrupt, and was obliged to sell his splendid establishment in —— street, and <br>  remove to a small house which belonged to Emily’s mother, and which was the <br>  only property he could not be deprived of. But to return to Emily. <br></p><p>  The picture of former days would sometimes rise, and appear like a fairy <br>  dream, from which she had been too soon awakened. She thought of the kind <br>  mother who had been ever ready to gratify her childish wishes—and of Edward, <br>  too, she thought much. Would he believe his sister’s falsehoods? was a <br>  question that often perplexed her. And were there no mingling of resentment in <br>  these recollections? Not any. Her heart had been taught a better discipline. <br></p><p>  Two years passed away, and Emily found peace, if not happiness. She was now <br>  twenty-one years old, and it was in her power to retaliate her injuries, by <br>  turning her father out of her house, which was now in her possession; but <br>  instead of this she wrote a long and kind letter, entreating him to occupy it <br>  as long as he wished. <br></p><p>  Having but little to engage her attention, Emily offered to teach a school for <br>  the children of the village. For this purpose, a room was fitted up in a small <br>  light building, erected near the river for the convenience of washing. During <br>  her residence with her kind aunt, it had been her favorite care to ornament <br>  and improve it. She had planted all around it the rose of cassia, jessamine, <br>  honeysuckle and grape vines. Their mingled blossoms and intertwining branches <br>  formed a luxuriant drapery, which soon became one mass of living verdure. From <br>  this little nest of flowers, an avenue, shaded by old elms, led down to the <br>  river, whose smooth surface was broken into ripples by the dipping branches of <br>  the weeping willow, as its waters went sparkling and gleaming along in their <br>  noiseless beauty. Here, in pleasant weather, Emily often ranged her scholars, <br>  in the open air; and then there were bright eyes and happy faces, for children <br>  do not love the confinement of a school room. The exercises of the day were <br>  generally concluded with a hymn and prayer, in which all were taught to join. <br></p><p>  It was near the close of a delightful day in June, and their melodious voices <br>  were just breaking the stillness of that beautiful solitude, when a gentleman, <br>  attracted by the sound, came to the opposite bank, and, concealed by the <br>  shade, listened with intense delight to the infant warblers. <br></p><p>  The last note died away, and a solemn pause ensued. “Now, my dear little <br>  children,” said Emily, “will you join me, with your whole hearts, in a prayer <br>  to our Heavenly Father who has watched over and protected us through the day.” <br>  She then kneeled down on the green earth, and was soon encircled by her cherub <br>  band of scholars, who also knelt and softly repeated, after their youthful <br>  instructress, The Lord’s Prayer. Then came the fervent “amen”—“Amen!” repeated <br>  their innocent lips, and “Amen!” echoed the green hills. Then, slowly, they <br>  all arose, kissed Emily, one by one, crossed the little bridge, and <br>  disappeared. <br></p><p>  But the stranger yet remained. It was Edward Brumiere, once the friend of <br>  Emily—and if he had ever doubted her, could he any longer question the <br>  goodness and purity of the beautiful being before him? It was impossible. A <br>  moment, and he was at her side. Surprise deepened the rose on her cheek, and <br>  she confessed the pleasure she felt in again meeting him. She extended her <br>  hand to him with a cordial smile, for she had not yet learned to hide her <br>  feelings under the mask of indifference. <br></p><p>  “I come from your father, my dear Emily. He is not very well, and feels the <br>  want of your kindness and good nursing.” <br></p><p>  “But where is my ———mother?” she enquired, hesitatingly. “She is obliged to <br>  divide her attentions between him and your little brother, who has been <br>  sometime ill, of a lingering complaint, which they fear will terminate in a <br>  consumption. But are you quite willing to forget your resentment?” “I have <br>  none.” “Your injuries then?” “I freely forgive them as I hope to be forgiven.” <br></p><p>  “Do you know their extent? Driven from your home, calumniated, disinherited, <br>  by one who pledged herself your friend.” <br></p><p>  While enumerating these, he closely watched her countenance, and finding there <br>  no expression but forgiving love, he continued, “or do you not feel their <br>  force?” An unbidden tear fell down her cheek, silently refuting the charge of <br>  insensibility. <br></p><p>  Love sprung in his heart spontaneous; and tenderly taking her hand, he said <br>  with much emotion, “Amiable girl!—have you no connection with earth, that you <br>  have divested yourself of human passions and frailties.” <br></p><p>  “Afflictions have been sanctified to me, and have taught me that hatred and <br>  happiness cannot exist in the same bosom.” <br></p><p>  “Matilda is my sister; forgive me, Emily! I believed what she said of you! I <br>  could almost <br>  <em>hate</em>  her for <br>  <em>your</em>  sake, had you not given me a better example.” <br></p><p>  “It is perfectly natural to believe the assertions of those we love; but I <br>  hope my study may be to contradict the tongue of slander by my conduct. Anger <br>  so blinds our reason, that Matilda might imagine me the unkind, guilty <br>  creature she represents me. Thus saying, she led the way to the house, where <br>  she introduced Edward to her aunt. <br></p><p>The next morning found them at Mr. Minnette’s door.</p><p>  Edward remained in the parlor, that he might put no restraint upon the <br>  feelings of either party, while Emily was shown to her father’s room. She <br>  clung round his neck—he embraced her, and she once more felt happy in his <br>  returning love. <br></p><p>  The open door of an adjoining room discovered Matilda, bending over the bed of <br>  her sick child, with all a mother’s fondness in her looks. In her deep anxiety <br>  the predominant expression of unbending pride was lost; and instead, there <br>  seemed something like repentance, nay, even kindness as her eye rested on <br>  Emily. <br></p><p>  From this time, Emily divided her cares between her father and brother, and <br>  determined by her attentions to merit the love of her family. Perhaps she was <br>  more condescending than some, yet none thought her mean-spirited, or weak, or <br>  respected her the less; but all admired the forgiving spirit she displayed. <br></p><p>  Mr. Minnette soon recovered, which gave some reason to suspect that his <br>  disorder originated in remorse; and now, Emily transferred all her attentions <br>  to her suffering brother. She had, while with her aunt (who was the medical <br>  adviser of the whole village) acquired considerable knowledge of roots and <br>  herbs, and these she successfully employed in his recovery. <br></p><p>  Every day she carried the sufferer out of doors in her arms for the benefit of <br>  exercise and fresh air, of which Matilda, by a mistake in the art of nursing, <br>  had deprived him. He soon felt the good effect of the change, and the <br>  delighted mother saw once more the glow of health upon his cheek, and <br>  returning activity in his tiny limbs. <br></p><p>  Matilda’s haughty spirit had been broken down by adversity, and Emily’s <br>  conduct had shamed “the offending spirit” out of her. Her understanding was <br>  naturally good, but it had been perverted by a faulty education, dictated by <br>  an injudiciously fond parent. A train of concurring circumstances roused her <br>  better feelings and they triumphed over the errors of education and the <br>  habitual follies of many years! and she bent before the altar of her God, a <br>  repentant woman and a humble and sincere christian. And now, from being the <br>  most wretched, they became, proverbially, the most united and happy family in <br>  New-York. Having performed her duties at home, Emily, according to promise, <br>  returned to her aunt, accompanied by Edward, who by the consent of all parties <br>  had become her betrothed husband. <br></p><p>  “Let us be married, Emily,” said he, “on the anniversary of the river scene; <br>  then I shall unite in one the two most interesting events of my life, my <br>  marriage and the event which led to it.” <br></p><p>  A year from that day, Emily became the wife of Edward—and each succeeding one <br>  finds her in the midst of love and happiness surrounded by her family of <br>  little ones, to whom Edward annually repeats the Tale of Forgiveness. <br></p>
