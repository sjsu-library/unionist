    <h4>Commentary</h4>
      <p>Church attendance, and church membership, were valorized cultural norms. Church seating was institutionalized as a marker of white supremacy, with African-Americans most often being limited to seats in the balcony. In fact, this very issue had led to the walkout by Black leaders Richard Allen and Absalom Jones from St. George's Methodist Church in Philadelphia that launched the northern Black independent chuch movement (see http://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/pds/maai/community/text3/allenmethodism.pdf ).  Therefore this particular battle in Canterbury carried great emotional and strategic weight. For those reading about this controversy in the press - including The Unionist - the idea of denying the students access to attending church created an informal litmus test: spiritual equality before God (favoring the students) or preserving caste privilege in the key social institution that was the Congregational Church in Connecticut.</p>
