    <p>DECLARATION OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY CONVENTION.</p> <p>   The Convention, assembled in the City of Philadelphia to organize a National   Anti-Slavery Society, promptly seize the opportunity to promulgate the   following DECLARATION OF SENTIMENTS, as cherished by them in relation to the   enslavement of one-sixth portion of the American people. </p> <p>   More than fifty-seven years have elapsed since a band of patriots convened in   this place, to devise measures for the deliverance of this country from a   foreign yoke. The corner-stone upon which they founded the TEMPLE OF FREEDOM   was broadly this—“that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by   their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life,   LIBERTY, and the pursuit of happiness.” At the sound of their trumpet-call,   three millions of people rose up as from the sleep of death, and rushed to the   strife of blood; deeming it more glorious to die instantly as freemen, than   desirable to live one hour as slaves.—They were few in number—poor in   resources; but the honest conviction that Truth and Justice, were on their   side, made them invincible. </p> <p>   We have met together for the achievement of an enterprise, without which, that   of our fathers is incomplete, and which, for its magnitude, solemnity, and   probable results upon the destiny of the world, as far transcends theirs, as   moral truth does physical force. </p> <p>   In purity of motive, in earnestness of zeal, in decision of purpose, in   intrepidity of action, in stead fastness of faith, in sincerity of spirit, we   would not be inferior to them. </p> <p>   <em>Their</em>   principles led them to wage war against their oppressors, and to spill human   blood like water, in order to be free.   <em>Ours</em>   forbid the doing of evil that good may come, and lead us to reject, the use of   all carnal weapons for deliverance from bondage—relying solely upon those   which are spiritual, and mighty through God to the pulling down of strong   holds. </p> <p>   <em>Their</em>   measures were physical resistance—the marshalling in arms—the hostile   array—the mortal encounter.   <em>Ours</em>   shall be such only as the opposition of moral purity to moral corruption—the   destruction of error by the potency of truth—the overthrow of prejudice by the   power of love—and the abolition of slavery by the spirit of repentance. </p> <p>   <em>Their</em>   grievances, great as they were, were trifling in comparison with the wrongs   and sufferings of those for whom we plead. Our fathers were never slaves—never   bought and sold like cattle—never shut out from the light of knowledge and   religion—never subjected to the lash of brutal taskmasters. </p> <p>   But those, for whose emancipation we are striving, —constituting at the   present time at least one-sixth part of our countrymen, are recognized by the   laws, and treated by their fellow beings, as marketable commodities—as goods   and chattels—as brute beasts—are plundered daily of the fruits of their toil   without redress;—really enjoy no constitutional nor legal protection from   licentious and murderous outrages upon their persons;—are ruthlessly torn   asunder—the tender babe from the arms of its frantic mother—the heart-broken   wife from her weeping husband—at the caprice or pleasure of irresponsible   tyrants;—and, for the crime of having a dark complexion, suffer the pangs of   hunger, the infliction of stripes, and the ignominy of brutal servitude. They   are kept in heathenish darkness by laws expressly enacted to make their   instruction a criminal offence. </p> <p>   These are the prominent circumstances in the condition of more than TWO   MILLIONS of our people, proof of which may be found in thousands of   indisputable facts, and in the laws of the slaveholding States. </p> <p>Hence we maintain—</p> <p>   That in view of the civil and religious privileges of this nation, the guilt   of its oppression is unequalled by any other on the face of the earth;—and,   therefore, </p> <p>   That it is bound to repent instantly, to undo the heavy burden, to break every   yoke, and let the oppressed go free. </p> <p>We farther maintain—</p> <p>   That no man has a right to enslave or imbrute his brother—to hold or   acknowledge him, for one moment, as a piece of merchandise—to keep back his   hire by fraud—or to brutalize his mind by denying him the means of   intellectual, social and moral improvement. </p> <p>   The right to enjoy liberty is inalienable. To invade it, is to usurp the   prerogative of Jehovah. Every man has a right to his own body—to the products   of his own labor—to the protection of law—and to the common advantages of   society. It is piracy to buy or steal a native African and subject him to   servitude. Surely the sin is as great to enslave an American as an African. </p> <p>Therefore we believe and affirm—</p> <p>   That there is no difference,   <em>in principle,</em>   between the African slave trade and American slavery; </p> <p>   That every American citizen, who retains a human being in involuntary bondage,   is [according to Scripture] a MAN-STEALER; </p> <p>   That the slaves ought instantly to be set free, and brought under the   protection of law; </p> <p>   That if they had lived from the time of Pharaoh down to the present period,   and had been entailed through successive generations, their right to be free   could never have been alienated, but their claims would have constantly risen   in solemnity; </p> <p>   That all those laws which are not in force, admitting the right of slavery,   are therefore before God utterly null and void, being an audacious usurpation   of the Divine prerogative, a daring infringement on the law of nature, a base   overthrow of the very foundations of the social compact, a complete extinction   of all the relations, endearments and obligations of mankind, and a   presumptuous transgression of all the holy commandments—and that therefore   they ought to be instantly abrogated. </p> <p>We further believe and affirm—</p> <p>   That all persons of color who possess the qualifications which are demanded of   others, ought to be admitted forthwith to the enjoyment of the same   privileges, and the exercise of the same prerogatives, as others; and that the   paths of preferment, of wealth. and of intelligence, shall be opened as widely   to them as to persons of a white complexion. </p> <p>   We maintain that no compensation should be given to the planters emancipating   their slaves— </p> <p>   Because it would be a surrender of the great fundamental principle that man   cannot hold property in man; </p> <p>   Because   <em>Slavery is a crime, and therefore is not an article to be sold;</em> </p> <p>   Because the holders of slaves are not the just proprietors of what they claim;   freeing the slaves is not depriving them of property, but restoring it to the   right owner; —it is not wronging the master, but righting the slave—restoring   him to himself; </p> <p>   Because immediate and general emancipation would only destroy nominal, not   real property it would not amputate a limb or break a bone of the slaves, but   by infusing motives into their breasts, would make them doubly valuable to the   masters as free laborers; and </p> <p>   Because if compensation is to be given at all, it should be given to the   outraged and guiltless slaves, and not to those who have plundered and abused   them. </p> <p>   We regard, as delusive, cruel and dangerous, any scheme of expatriation which   pretends to aid, either directly or indirectly, in the emancipation of the   slaves, or to be a substitute for the immediate and total abolition of   slavery. </p> <p>   We fully and unanimously recognize the sovereignty of each State, to legislate   exclusively on the subject of the slavery which is tolerated within its   limits. We concede that Congress, under the present national compact, has no   right to interfere with any of the slave states, in relation to this momentous   subject. </p> <p>   But we maintain that Congress has a right, and is solemnly bound, to suppress   the domestic slave trade between the several States, and to abolish slavery in   those portions of our territory which the Constitution has placed under its   exclusive jurisdiction. </p> <p>   We also maintain that there are, at the present time, the highest obligations   resting upon the people of the free States, to remove slavery by moral and   political action, as prescribed in the Constitution of United States. They are   now living under a pledge of their tremendous physical force to fasten the   galling fetters of tyranny upon the limbs of millions in the southern   States;—they are liable to be called at any moment to suppress a general   insurrection of the slaves;—they authorize the slave owner to vote for   three-fifths of his slaves as property, and thus enable him to perpetuate his   oppression;—they support a standing army at the south for its protection;—and   they seize the slave who has escaped into their territories, and send him back   to be tortured by an enraged master or a brutal driver. </p> <p>   This relation to slavery is criminal and full of danger:   <em>it must be broken up.</em> </p> <p>   These are our views and principles—these, our designs and measures. With   entire confidence in the overruling justice of God, we plant ourselves upon   the Declaration of our Independence, and upon the truth of Divine Revelation,   as upon the Everlasting Rock. </p> <p>   We shall organize Anti-Slavery Societies, if possible, in every city, town and   village of our land. </p> <p>   We shall send forth Agents to lift up the voice of remonstrance, of warning of   entreaty and rebuke. </p> <p>   We shall circulate, unsparingly and extensively, anti slavery tracts and   periodicals. </p> <p>   We shall enlist the Pulpit and the Press in the cause of the suffering and the   dumb. </p> <p>   We shall aim at a purification of the churches from all participation in the   guilt of slavery. </p> <p>   We shall encourage the labor of freemen over that of the slaves, by giving a   preference to their productions;—and </p> <p>   We shall spare no exertions nor means to bring the whole nation to speedy   repentance. </p> <p>   Our trust for victory is solely in GOD.   <em>We</em>   may be personally defeated, but our principles never. TRUTH, JUSTICE, and   HUMANITY, must and will gloriously triumph. Already a host is coming up to the   help of the Lord against the mighty, and the prospect before us is full of   encouragement. </p> <p>   Submitting this DECLARATION to the candid examination of the people of this   country, and of the friends of liberty all over the world, we hereby affix our   signatures to it; pledging ourselves that, under the guidance and by the help   of Almighty God, we will do all that in us lies, consistently with this   Declaration of our principles, to overthrow the most execrable system of   slavery that has ever been witnessed upon earth—to deliver our land from its   deadliest curse—to wipe out the foulest stain which rests upon our national   escutcheon—and to secure to the colored population of the United States all   the rights and privileges which belong to them as men and as Americans—come   what may to our persons, our interests, or our reputations—whether we live to   witness the triumph of Justice, Liberty and Humanity, or perish untimely as   martyrs in this great, benevolent, and holy cause. </p> <p>   David   Thurston,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   B.

     <h3>About this Item</h3>
       <p>There is much to add, relevant to The Unionist and the Canterbury Female Academy, to this Declaration. <p>   In the same issue of <em>The Abolitionist</em> that printed the Declaration, African-American delegate Robert Purvis delivered an encomium for William Lloyd Garrison:   <em>The Abolitionist</em>   1:12:183 (December 1833) </p><p>In a pair of motions intimately related to the Canterbury Female Academy, the convention expressed its appreciation of education in general, and Canterbury in particular.</p> <p>"On motion of Simeon S. Jocelyn, seconded by Amos A. Phelps, it was</p> <p>   Resolved.&nbsp; That the fountains of knowledge, like those of salvation,   should be open to every creature, and that we regard those laws and prejudices   which prevent or restrict the education of the people of color, bond or free,   as pre-eminently cruel and impious, and disgraceful to a christian state or   nation; and that we will seek their abolishment, both in the free and slave   States, if possible more earnestly than corporeal slavery itself, in as much   as ignorance enslaves the mind, and tends to the ruin of the immortal soul. </p> <p>On motion of John Prentice, seconded by William Goodell, it was</p> <p>   Resolved, That this convention highly approve of the philanthropic effort of   Miss Prudence Crandall of Canterbury, Conn. in her labors to instruct our   colored sisters; and while we deeply sympathize with her in view of the   persecutions she has endured in the prosecution of her pious purposes, we   pledge ourselves to afford her our continued countenance and assistance"   <em>The Abolitionist</em>   1:12:184 (December 1833) Goodell was the editor of <em>The Genius of Temperance</em>; Jocelyn and Phelps were both endorsers of the Canterbury Female Academy. </p> <p>   <em>The Abolitionist</em> in that same December issue also published a letter from Charles Stuart to William Lloyd Garrison, that    made reference also to letters from Buffum and   Forten: "Many hearts are beating here for the glorious Prudence   Crandall. Some of my young friends are working little parcels of   presents for me to take to her dear pupils in the Spring." (written from   Liverpool) </p> <p>   Samuel Joseph May and John G. Whittier worked with the principal author, William Lloyd Garrison, on the 1833 Declaration of Sentiments of the American Anti-Slavery Society. The language of the Declaration, and the sense of who was behind it, demonstrates how nonviolence already held some prominence in the movement at the time of the Canterbruy Female Academy. Furthermore, they were working at the home of African-American activist and dentist James McCrummell (Benjamin Quarles, <em>Black Abolitionists</em> New York: Da Capo Press, 1991; original edition 1969, p. vii-viii)  </p> </p>
