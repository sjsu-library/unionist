    <p align="center">[Reported for the Unionist.]</p><p align="center">TRIAL OF FREDERIC OLNEY.</p><p align="center">  <em>Windham County Court</em>  , ss.<br>  <em>March Term</em>  1834.<br></p><p align="center">Present – HON. JUDGES EATON, GRIFFIN and CHASE.</p><p align="center">State vs. Frederic Olney</p><p>  The information charged the defendant with having on the 28<sup>th</sup>  of January last, feloniously, voluntarily, maliciously, and wilfully, set fire<br>  to the dwelling-house of Miss Prudence Crandall, in Canterbury, in the County<br>  of Windham, and then and there, with force and arms, burning the same. The<br>  information having been read, the defendant for plea, said that he was NOT<br>  GUILTY.<br></p><p>  <em>Ebenezer Sangar</em>  was at the house of Miss Crandall the day of the fire—did not get there till<br>  it was pretty much over. The house was wet, and people were at work about it,<br>  cutting up the floors, &amp;c. While witness was in the house, Mr. Olney (the<br>  defendant) came in and told Capt. Bacon, who was cutting up the mop-board,<br>  that it was useless to cut longer for there was no fire. People soon began to<br>  go away. Mr. Olney showed where he said the fire commenced—placed his hand on<br>  a particular place and the expressed he used was “<br>  <em>Gentlemen of the jury, here the fire commenced.”</em>  He had an iron-bar in his hand, with which he took off the moulding &amp;c.,<br>  to show what the fire had done. It seemed that the fire had worked from the<br>  inside of the house to the outside—this appeared by the boards and timbers—the<br>  top of the soil was burnt off, as was also the outside—it was rotten so that<br>  it might be picked to pieces—the bottom of the sill was not burnt. In the<br>  north-east room, below, there was in the inside under the mop-board a crack<br>  which was perhaps three-eights [sic] of an inch in width—the fire-place is on<br>  the west side of the room—the house fronts the east—the fire was in the<br>  north-east corner of the room. There was no difficulty, in the opinion of the<br>  witness, in setting the house on fire in the way it was from the inside—it<br>  might have been done by thrusting under-lighted paper, &amp;c. If fired in<br>  this way the outer edge of the sill would be likely to catch first. Should not<br>  think that fire could have been put on the outside so as to cause the<br>  fire—does not think it possible that the top of the sill could have been set<br>  fire to from the outside, as this sill was. The principal part of the burning<br>  was high up near the chamber floor.<br></p><p>  <em>Cross-examined.</em>  Saw no fire after he got there. Most of the cutting was done before he got<br>  there—the weather-board was taken up and the mouldings—some clap-boards had<br>  been taken off before—it was from 12 to 15 inches from the upright post, and<br>  south of it, in the corner of the room where the fire did most damage. No hole<br>  was burned, but the wood was blacked—should think the fire originally<br>  commenced at the place mentioned near the post. The board next the sill, and<br>  the side of it next the sill, was burned most—this board had a crack in it,<br>  and the wood near the crack was charred, mostly on the inside. The lathing was<br>  burned some, enough so as to black one’s fingers—witness did not make his<br>  examinations all at one time, but at several—once with Dr. Harris.<br></p><p>  <em>Vine Robinson.</em>  On Saturday of the week that the fire happened he went, as one of the<br>  committee from the Insurance Company, to make some agreement, if possible,<br>  with Miss Crandall as to the amount of loss which she had sustained. The house<br>  seemed to be in the same situation as it was left immediately after the<br>  fire—the clap-boards were torn off, &amp;c. Examined, to satisfy his mind, how<br>  the fire originated—became convinced that it took first on the sill, between<br>  the first stud and the post—burned apparently up to the chamber-floor, and<br>  meeting with some instruction there, seemed to branch off—burned the boards<br>  and joist, should think there was more burning in the chamber-floor than<br>  elsewhere—proceeded to place the boards, &amp;c. round the pilaster as they<br>  originally were, in order to ascertain if there was any place where the fire<br>  could have been introduced from without—the board at the bottom of the sill<br>  was burnet off—the clap-boards were not burnt—found no place on examination<br>  where the fire could have been introduced—thinks it impossible to have<br>  communicated the fire from the outside so as to produce the effect visible—the<br>  crack between the mop-board and the floor on the inside of the room was<br>  perhaps one third of an inch wide—no difficulty in putting fire under it—if a<br>  match were placed under the mop-board and pushed along it would fall about two<br>  inches on to the sill—witness became satisfied that the Company would be<br>  responsible for the loss, and tried to settle the amount but could not. It was<br>  left to Col. Eaton to procure a carpenter and finish the business—the sill was<br>  considerably decayed—the fire was confined between the first stud and the<br>  post.<br></p><p>  <em>Cross examined.</em>  There was a hole burnt in the boards a considerable height from the ground,<br>  higher than he could reach—this could be seen from the outside—the board at<br>  the bottom was perhaps 8 inches wide—three or four inches of it were burnt<br>  off—this board was near the post—about the space of a foot along the sill it<br>  was charred—the sill at the bottom was whole.<br></p><p>  <em>Ebenezer Sangar,</em>  again called, testified as to one of the boards that was burnt near the<br>  post—the board went to the bottom of the sill.<br></p><p>  <em>Elkanah C. Eaton</em>  was also one of the Committee with Judge Robinson to settle damages, and with<br>  him examined to find out the origin of the fire. (Col. Eaton said he concurred<br>  in the statement given by Judge Robinson, and recapitulated, with little<br>  variation, the same general facts.)<br></p><p>  <em>Richard Fenner</em>  got to the fire nearly as soon as any one—saw the smoke from the outside, and<br>  went directly into the house. Saw Miss Crandall and asked her if the fire came<br>  from the cellar; she said, no, her house had been set on fire. Witness<br>  assisted to pry up the hearth to find the fire, but found but little—the smoke<br>  continued to increase—water was thrown on. After the fire was got under, Olney<br>  shoed the witness and others a spot on the outside of the house, where he said<br>  the fire began—witness examined it more critically, because he did not notice<br>  it when he first came to the fire; Witness came out of his store immediately<br>  after he heard the bell ring, and a cry of fire—Saw smoke come from the corner<br>  of the house, up some height from the ground.—Olney said that when he first<br>  came out of the house, he saw fire blazing out of a crack, and pointed it out<br>  to witness—the paint around it was scorched.<br></p><p>  <em>Cross Examined.</em>  The crack with Olney showed witness was perhaps an eighth of an inch in width,<br>  just by the bottom of the sill, between the bottom board and the moulding—saw<br>  no appearance of fire when the place was pointed out—witness at first saw no<br>  fire, nothing but smoke which came from about the window casings—Olney was at<br>  the corner of the house when he got there and had an axe in his hand—it was<br>  after the fire was over that Olney pointed out this place—perhaps<br>  three-fourths of an hour after the alarm.<br></p><p>  <em>Daniel Morgan</em>  was at the house of Dr. Harris at the time of the fire, and noticed a tub of<br>  water brought out from Miss Crandall’s and thrown on to the side of the<br>  house—a little steam arose which led him to suppose the water was hot—Charles<br>  Harris soon brought an axe—Olney took it and struck a blow or two on the house<br>  near the corner with it. Witness then went over to Miss C’s house, but saw no<br>  fire—looked into the house and saw smoke in the room—told Miss C. that it must<br>  come from the cellar—examined, but found none—a little smoke could not be seen<br>  coming out from the house, seven or eight feet from the ground, near the<br>  floor—they had axes and struck in to take off the clapboards—took off some but<br>  saw no fire till the floor was torn up in the chamber—then saw a little and a<br>  great deal of smoke, so much that it was impossible to stay in the room. The<br>  sill appeared natural, but some rotten—took out some shavings which were black<br>  but not burnt—witness got to the house before any one, unless it was Mr.<br>  Robinson—as he could see no fire he was surprised that they had raised an<br>  alarm—did not see Olney when he first got over to the house—when he first saw<br>  him he was near the corner of the house—the clapboards which&nbsp; he and Mr<br>  Robinson cut were as high as they could reach.<br></p><p>  <em>Cross Examined.</em>  Witness saw Olney and Harris at the corner of Miss Crandall’s house, before he<br>  came over from Dr Harris’—Harris soon started to ring the bell and Olney<br>  dashed on a tub of water—this was before the blows with an axe—the water was<br>  thrown on the side of the house, between the window and the post—cannot say<br>  whether Olney cut off any portion of the house—thought that a small piece was<br>  cut off at first—continued to think so till the former trial, when a piece was<br>  shown, said to be cut off—he then and now doubts whether any was cut off—Dr.<br>  Harris’ house is six or seven rods from Miss Crandall’s.<br></p><p>  <em>Ralph Robinson</em>  got to the fire, when some of the neighbors were standing at the corner—could<br>  see smoke coming out—witness tried to cut off some of the clapboards, but<br>  could not reach them—pried them off with an iron bar—they could then see a<br>  little fire—no clapboards had been cut when witness got there—did not leave<br>  his school house till after the bell rung—saw no fire at the bottom of the<br>  pilaster—the clap-boards were got off in a very few minutes, perhaps three—saw<br>  water thrown on after the clap-boards were taken off, not before.<br></p><p>  <em>Peter Spicer,</em>  (a carpenter,) examined the house day of the the first court (sic). [Mr.<br>  Spicer showed the manner in which the boards &amp;c. were burned, and gave it<br>  as his opinion that the fire communicated from within.]<br></p><p>  <em>Horace Bacon,</em>  assisted to arrest Frederick Olney, it was in a barber’s shop at Norwich—a<br>  number of persons were present—some one asked witness his opinion as to the<br>  origin of the fire—said that he believed it caught from the inside. Olney said<br>  he knew as much about the fire as any one. Witness replied, I suppose you do.<br>  Olney then said that Miss Crandall wished him to fix her clock—that he<br>  commenced fixing it and soon found smoke in the room—at first thought the<br>  evergreens in the room were on fire, examined them and found they were<br>  not—then thought the carpet was—found that it was not. Soon heard the fire<br>  roar in the walls of the house ran out and saw it burst out from a crack near<br>  the corner of the house.<br></p><p>  <em>James Cary</em>  read the warrant to Olney in Norwich. Mr Bacon said that he thought the fire<br>  caught on the inside—Olney said that there was a knot-hole outside about the<br>  bigness of a dollar where the fire might have been placed. (Witness then went<br>  out).<br></p><p>  <em>Maria Robinson</em>  was at Miss Crandall’s house at work on the 28<sup>th</sup>  day of January, the day of the fire—the stage stopped, and the first she saw<br>  Olney he was standing by the side of the stage—some bundles &amp;c. were<br>  brought into the house and Olney came in and sat down in the keeping-room by<br>  the fire, remarked that it was cold, looking at the clock on the mantel-piece,<br>  after he had sat a few moments, said to Miss Crandall, “your clock does not<br>  beat right.” Miss Crandall replied, that she had not noticed it, or did not<br>  know it. Miss Crandall soon asked him to take off his surtout, and said that<br>  she had not asked him before because she supposed he was cold—Mr Olney asked<br>  if Mr. and Mrs Harris were in the house, and was told they were in the<br>  kitchen, said to Miss Crandall, “with your permission I will go and see them,”<br>  she said, yes—he came back in a little while, and that he had promised to<br>  write to a lady in New-York as soon as he got there and had seen her little<br>  daughter, the paper was brought, and Olney wrote and sealed a letter, he then<br>  went out and witness saw him no more till dinner, when she saw him in the<br>  upper kitchen, talking with Mr. and Mrs. Harris. After dinner she came back to<br>  the keeping-room, and a number of the girls were in and out. They all went out<br>  but witness, as she thinks, (she remarked that Miss Almira Crandall thought<br>  she remained after her) and witness, who was sewing, laid down her work, and<br>  went to the kitchen. Had heard Olney talking in the kitchen before this, and<br>  had seen him there. Very soon there was a disturbance, and some one cried that<br>  the house was on fire. Witness said it could not be, but ran up stairs, for<br>  she remembered that she had left her work on the hearth and she was afraid<br>  that it had caught fire. Found the room so full of smoke, when she got to it,<br>  that she could not see the figure on the paper. Ran out of doors, and saw<br>  Olney standing near the corner of the house, looking for the fire. Witness<br>  told him that the chimney or roof was on fire, he said no, and soon said he<br>  had found it. Olney then struck on the corner of the house, with an axe, and<br>  told her to cry fire. It was about half-past ten or eleven when Olney came in<br>  the stage, witness noticed no smoke nor perceived any unpleasant smell in the<br>  keeping-room before fire was cried, don’t know where Olney went when he went<br>  from the keeping-room, but supposed he went to the kitchen.<br></p><p>  <em>Cross examined.</em>  Was in the keeping-room when the stage came up—soon after Olney came in the<br>  clock struck eleven—thinks it was an hour after dinner when she was employed<br>  sewing—Olney had not been alone in the keeping-room&nbsp; more than a minute,<br>  when the fire was cried—after Olney had struck on the corner of the house with<br>  the axe, he called for water—he had asked for an axe before—he cut off a small<br>  piece of the house, and some one bro’t water—told Harris to get the bell<br>  rung—heard nothing said about fixing the clock—there were festoons of<br>  evergreen hung around the room.<br></p><p>  <em>Amy Fenner</em>  was in the school room at the time of the fire—saw Mr. Olney as he came in the<br>  stage, at about half past ten—saw him no more till dinner. Witness went<br>  upstairs to the school room, and Miss Crandall sent the class down to<br>  read—they came down to the keeping-room, and witness saw Mr. Olney fixing the<br>  clock—she saw smoke, and said to Mr. Olney, What is the matter? What does this<br>  mean? She pointed Olney to the corner of the room—he put down his ear, and<br>  said he heard it roar—then immediately called for an axe—witness was very much<br>  scared.<br>  <strong>This is the key testimony, from a student</strong></p><p>  <em>Cross examined.</em>  Knows nothing of the letter—Olney was talking with Mrs. Harris when witness<br>  saw him at dinner—‘twas not more than three minutes after she was told to go<br>  down with the class to read before she was in the room with Olney—he was<br>  alone—the door was wide open—cannot tell what Olney was doing to the clock,<br>  she was so frightened—smelled nothing in the room before—Olney’s back was<br>  towards the smoke, he could not see it without turning round—witness could see<br>  it immediately on entering—heard no walking in the room before she came in,<br>  was out of doors when the tub of water was thrown on the house—Olney took the<br>  tub from the hands of Miss Crandall—cannot tell whether the door of the clock<br>  was open or not she was so frightened—the smoke had just began to come out of<br>  the corner.<br></p><p>  <em>Henrietta Bolt</em>  was a member of the same class, and made a statement similar to the last<br>  witness.<br></p><p>  <em>Delano Baker</em>  was at the fire not long after it was cried—went from Dr. Harris’ wood-pile,<br>  saw smoke, but no fire was visible—Olney was standing by the corner of the<br>  house, axes were called for, witness said he could get one. After the fire was<br>  over Olney showed where he said the fire began—said, “here, gentlemen of the<br>  jury, here is the place where the fire began.” Witness went away soon, and did<br>  not notice where Olney directed their attention—saw no fire at the former,<br>  when he got to the house first; thinks he should have seen it if there had<br>  been any; a spot was burned up some distance from the ground. What is implied<br>  by Olney using legalistic language here? Prescience?<br></p><p>  <em>Cross examined.</em>  Was a stranger in the place, and does not know the people who were at the<br>  house; should not know the girls of the house again if he saw them.<br></p><p>  <em>Augustus Prior</em>  went with Col. Eaton to examine the house in order to ascertain the damages;<br>  it was on Monday. (second examination.) [Mr. Prior agreed generally in his<br>  statement with Col. Eaton, and was of opinion that the fire was communicated<br>  from within.]<br></p><p>  <em>Ralph Hutchinson</em>  examined the house of Miss Crandall on the day of the court of inquiry before<br>  the Justice; the board on the outside, near the crack, was burnt to a coal; a<br>  part of the burning could be seen from the outside; did not notice whether the<br>  lath was burnt or not; the pedestal is 16 3-4 inches; the base of the pilaster<br>  1 1-4 feet; the mop-board was up from the floor a full half inch, a foot from<br>  the corner; the first stud was perhaps 13 inches from the post; thinks the<br>  fire could easily have been introduced from the inside; the mortar was gone at<br>  the time of the examination made b witness, and that being gone, the fire<br>  could also have been introduced from the outside; if the mortar had not been<br>  taken out, he should think it could not have been introduced from the outside;<br>  witness saw mortar lying on the ground.<br></p><p>  <em>Cross examined.</em>  The place where the burnt part could be seen from without, was by the<br>  water-stable; it was just perceivable; should think the fire might have been<br>  seen at this place from without; the bottom board sets on the water-table; the<br>  inside of the oak board was burnt very much; the outside not much; the fire<br>  could not have been put on the top of the sill from the outside.<br></p><p>  <em>Chauncey Bacon,</em>  at the time that Miss Crandall’s house was discovered to be on fire, was in<br>  Mr. Jenk’s store. At first, he heard the bell ring, and saw people running,<br>  apparently towards Miss C.’s house. When he got to her front gate, he asked<br>  what was the matter? Was told, by a boy, that the house was on fire, and was<br>  pointed towards the northeast corner of the house; went directly into the<br>  house and found considerable smoke; some one took an axe, and beat a hole from<br>  the inside, through the plaster, in the east wall of the room; being told, on<br>  enquiry, that there was no other axe, witness got one from home and beat a<br>  number of holes in the north wall of the room; found no fire, and but little<br>  or no smoke; others were turning in water; witness then went into the cellar<br>  to look for the fire, but found none; then to the garret, and found none; soon<br>  after, witness went out of doors and found the people tearing off boards,<br>  &amp;c.; some were cutting up the boards in the floor up stairs, and he<br>  assisted; smoke came out and they threw in water; came down stairs, and saw<br>  fire first near the cornice, in the room below; could see but a small blaze;<br>  ran up stairs and told the people that the floor must come up; they took it<br>  up, together with the mop-board and very soon came to the fire; six or eight<br>  feet of the mop-board was cut off; the fire was soon got under; witness then<br>  examined the timbers, &amp;c. more particularly, though he could not do so as<br>  he wished, there was such a crowd; the lining boards were oak, put on the<br>  studs, and ran clear by, to the cut-edge of the post; the bottom board, south<br>  of where it was burnt off, was very snug, so that he could not pass a penknife<br>  in the crack; the crack between the mop-board and the floor, in the lower<br>  room, was large enough to take in his little finger, in some places; the under<br>  floor boards set on the sill about four inches; the upper ones an inch less;<br>  should not think it possible to get fire on the sill from the outside.<br></p><p>  <em>Cross examined.</em>  He put his finger in the crack, between the floor and the mop-board; the<br>  widest part of it was towards the south, at some distance from the corner,<br>  perhaps six feet; the floor boards run north and south; put his finger in the<br>  crack the day after the fire, and has since examined it; should think that the<br>  crack was 1-4 on an inch, near the corner; perceived no difference in its<br>  width at the different times he examined it; don’t know whether the sill was<br>  burnt at the bottom or on the sides; should think the under lining board was<br>  wider than the sill; the end of the bottom board was nurnt off; the board<br>  above it extends along to the end, so he presumes this one did; cannot say<br>  whether the board burnt off was fastened to the sill or not; has not examined<br>  the sill south of the stud where te fire was; found shavings between the studs<br>  after taking off the plastering; but few, perhaps three, four, or half a<br>  dozen. They were further south than where the fire was, between the first stud<br>  and post; don't recollect whether burnt or not; they were small pieces, not<br>  bigger than ninepenny pieces or cents; were old, and had probably been there<br>  from the building of the house.<br></p><p>  <em>John Bard.</em>  (This witness was present during the fire, and assisted to extinguish it; he<br>  gave particulars of the transaction, but stated to new facts that seemed<br>  material.)<br></p><p>  <em>Solomon Paine,</em>  with the committee from the Insurance Company, examined the premises after the<br>  fire. (Mr. Paine said he coincided in the statement made by Col. Eaton as to<br>  what they saw.) His opinion was, that if the lining board was as wide at the<br>  place where the fire was, as it was farther back, it would be impossible to<br>  set the fire from the outside; the board was some inches higher than the sill,<br>  a little back from the fire, where it was not burnt.<br></p><p>  <em>Nehemiah Ensworth.</em>  After he got to the fire, to which he was called by the ringing of the bell,<br>  he first went to the corner of the house and soon went into the house, met<br>  Olney and asked how the fire caught. Olney replied that he did not know, said<br>  he saw it about as soon as any one, that he was fixing the clock, saw a smoke,<br>  examined, and soon heard the fire roar, witness at this time did not know<br>  Olney.<br></p><p>  <em>Daniel Morgan</em>  again called. Saw the mortar taken out from the outside after the fire; it was<br>  whole.<br></p><p>  <em>Cross examined.</em>  Did not state this fact before the other court, though he did to some one<br>  present, perhaps Capt. Fenner, several persons took out some of the mortar,<br>  witness took out some, an inch and a half long, took it out to examine the<br>  sill, has not examined else-where, what he took out was moist, took it out<br>  with his fingers, some had been taken out before, cannot be positive who took<br>  it out; it was after the fire had been extinguished; Mr. Flint was present;<br>  thinks he took out some; it was under the sill and ran perpendicular; the<br>  mortar which he (the witness) took out was between the stones, immediately<br>  below the sill, not more than two or three inches below.<br></p><p>  <em>William Worthington.</em>  After the fire was pretty much out, Olney went up stairs and put his arm round<br>  one of the girl’s neck, and asked how many of them cried? They said, such a<br>  one. Olney then said they had no need to be scared before they were hurt; that<br>  he did not think the house would burn down, if it had, Miss Crandall would<br>  lose nothing for the house was insured; witness got to the house before the<br>  fire broke out; could then see no fire; went close to the corner; saw smoke;<br>  did not see Olney for a few minutes; no clapboards were cut when he (the<br>  witness) first got there. Mr. Robinson cut the first as high as he could<br>  reach.<br></p><p>  <em>Cross examined.</em>  Don’t know how many girls were present at the time of conversation he speaks<br>  of, shouldn’t know them now; witness was a pupil in Mr. Robinson’s school; he<br>  was in school, and it was said that Miss Crandall’s house was on fire; Mr. R.<br>  got there about as soon as they did; don’t know whether Mr Morgan was then<br>  there or not; saw him soon; did not see Miss Crandall; saw no water when he<br>  first got there; looked round to find the fire, and then went into the house;<br>  they had cut a few holes in the plastering; saw Olney near the corner of the<br>  house first.<br></p><p>  <em>Luther Sangar.</em>  (This was also a pupil of Mr. Robinson, was with the last witness and made a<br>  similar statement.)<br></p><p>[The prosecution here rested for the present.]</p><p align="center">[To be concluded in our next.]</p><p></p>
