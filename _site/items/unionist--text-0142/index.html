    <p>  “In the Brooklyn Unionist, Oct. 10<br>  <sup>th</sup>  , we find an account of a second trial of Miss Crandall before the Superior Court of Connecticut, Judge Daggett on the bench. The charge on which she was<br>  tried was for teaching colored people from other states. The Judge instructed<br>  the jury that free people of color are not citizens, and that the law of<br>  Connecticut is, therefore, not unconstitutional. The jury went out and after<br>  an absence of 20 or 30 minutes, returned with a verdict of guilty. A bill of<br>  exceptions was filed and the case put over to the Supreme Court of Errors, to<br>  be holden at Brooklyn next July.<br></p><p>  On this singular decision we remark that if the case be so that free colored<br>  people are not citizens of the United States, their condition is far worse<br>  than we had supposed. But we canot believe this, the arguments in the decision<br>  notwithstanding; and we cannot account for it that such a decision comes from<br>  Judge Daggett, except on the supposition that strong feeling, excited in his<br>  native place (New Haven), by an attempt to erect a similar school there some<br>  time ago, has biased his judgment.<br></p><p>Judge Daggett says</p><p>  ‘Are the colored inhabitants of this country citizens? It is the opinion of<br>  this court that they are not. Are slaves citizens of the U.S.? The<br>  constitution recognizes them only as the basis of representation and taxation.<br>  I refer to the definition of the word citizen as given by Mr. Webster, the<br>  ablest philologist of this or any country. (The judge here read the several<br>  definitions of the word as given in Webster’s dictionary, the last of which,<br>  and the only one applicable to the case is as follows—“In the United States, a<br>  person, native or naturalized, who has the privilege of exercising the<br>  elective franchise, and of purchasing and holding real estate.”) Slaves, then,<br>  are not citizens, in any of the state constitutions. Are Indians citizens? It<br>  is difficult to say what they are, but they are not citizens. Kent, in his<br>  commentaries, speaks of them as distinct tribes, living under the protection<br>  of the government,—2 Kent, 70. Are the free people of color citizens? I<br>  answer, No. They are not so styled in the Constitution of the United States,<br>  or, so far as I am aware, in the laws of Congress or of any of the states. In<br>  that clause of the constitution which fixes the basis of representation, there<br>  was an opportunity to have called them citizens if they were so considered.<br>  But that makes free <em>persons</em> (adding three fifths of all other persons,) the basis of representation and<br>  taxation.”<br></p><p>  “They” (the free people of color) are not so styled (citizens) in the<br>  constitution of the United States.” What then? is it not implied? The<br>  constitution does not so style free <em>white</em> persons, but does it not imply as much? Again, “In that clause which fixes the<br>  basis of representation, there was an opportunity to have called them citizens<br>  if they were so considered.” And so there was an opportunity to have called<br>  free white people citizens. If the omission excludes the one from citizenship,<br>  why not the other “But that (the constitution) makes free<br>  <em>persons</em>  (adding three fifths of all other persons) the basis of representation and<br>  taxation.” Now it seems to us that only two classes are here spoken of; first,<br>  free persons, who, absolutely, form a basis, and next, slaves, only three<br>  fifths of which form a basis. If then, the characteristic of forming a basis<br>  for representation and taxation, entire, without division (five fifths of a<br>  man and not three fifths) constitutes citizenship, by what logic is it<br>  inferred that<br>  <em>free</em>  colored persons are not citizens? The constitution it is true says nothing<br>  about complexion, but does the omission therefore exclude free colored persons<br>  If so can any one tell why it does not exclude free white persons?<br></p><p>  Judge Daggett says, “another reason for believing that people of color were<br>  not considered citizens is found in the fact&nbsp; that when the United States<br>  constitution was adopted, every state except Massachusetts, tolerated<br>  slavery.” We are dull—we do not see how this related to the point in question.<br></p><p>  It was argued in the Court, that free blacks own vessels which participate in<br>  the peculiar privileges of American shipping, and that blacks may sue in the<br>  United States courts. This was overruled on the ground that those points had<br>  never been settled by judicial decisions. We suppose it is true that free<br>  colored people have owned vessels, and participated in the peculiar privileges<br>  of American shipping ever since the constitution was formed, that they have<br>  also had suits in the U.S. Courts, and that they have received protections as<br>  American Citizens from British impressment. And it seems incredible that this<br>  should have gone of 57 years, unquestioned, if they were not in reality<br>  American citizens.<br></p><p>  What aid the definition of Webster gives to the decision we do not see. “In<br>  the United States (a citizen is) a person, native or naturalized, who has the<br>  privilege of exercising the elective franchise, and of purchasing and holding<br>  real estate.” Now in seven states the persons in question have the right of<br>  the elective franchise, and in all the right of purchasing and holding<br>  realestate. Does not the definition then make against the decision rather than<br>  for it?<br></p><p>  In this decision also Judge Daggett has gone in the face of very high opinion.<br>  In the Convention of New York for amending the constitution, on the motion to<br>  insert the word<br>  <em>white</em>  before the words “<br>  <em>male citizens,”</em>  in the article relating to the right of suffrage, Peter A. Jay said, “Is not<br>  the right of suffrage a privilege? Can you deny it to a<br>  <em>citizen</em>  of Pennsylvania, who comes here and complies with your laws, merely because he<br>  is not six feet high, or because he is of a dark complexion?’ Chancellor Kent<br>  said<br></p><p>  “Suppose a<br>  <em>negro</em>  owning a freehold, and entitled to vote in Vermont, removes to this state, can<br>  we constitutionally exclude him from the privilege of voting? The constitution<br>  of the United States provides that<br>  <em>citizens</em>  of each State shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of<br>  citizens of the several States.”<br></p><p>Rufus King said</p><p>  ‘Take the fact that a<br>  <em>citizen of color</em>  entitled to all the privileges of a citizen, comes here—he purchases a<br>  freehold—can you deny him the rights of an elector incident to his freehold?<br>  He is entitled to vote because like<br>  <em>any other citizen</em>  he is a freeholder, and ever freeholder your laws entitle to vote.’<br></p><p>And again,</p><p>  “<br>  <em>    As certainly as the children of any white men are citizen, so certainly the<br>    children of black men are citizens.”<br>  </em></p><p>Abram Van Vechten said,</p><p>  ‘There is another and to my mind an insuperable objection to the exclusion of<br>  free citizens of color from the right of suffrage, arising from the provision<br>  of the Constitution of the U.S. that the citizens of each State shall be<br>  entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several<br>  States.’<br></p><p>  In 1826 De Witt Clinton demanded of President Adams the release of ‘Gilbert<br>  Horton a free man of color and a citizen of this state’ (New York) unlawfully<br>  imprisoned in the District of Columbia, on the ground that he was ‘a free man<br>  and a citizen.’<br></p><p>  We cannot believe with Judge Daggett that the whole free colored population<br>  of our country is outlawed, that emancipation confers as privilege but that of<br>  rambling about. And we hope there is a higher appeal yet than the Supreme<br>  Court of blinded Connecticut before which this case may be tried. We believe<br>  the people of Canterbury and their abettors are heaping up for themselves a<br>  load of odium, which they will find it difficult to bear.”<br></p>
