    <p>ANGELL’S SCHOOL BOOKS.</p><p>  Published by MARSHALL, BROWN, &amp; Co. Providence: MARSHALL, CLARK &amp; Co.<br>  Philadelphia.<br></p><p>THE UNION NO. 1, OR CHILD’S FIRST BOOK.</p><p>  The arrangement of the lessons in this book is such that the child commences<br>  reading as soon as he commences putting the letters together into syllables!<br>  the (sic) exercises of spelling and reading being simultaneous. The plan has<br>  met with the unqualified approbation of those teachers who have used it, and<br>  who have had an opportunity of expressing their opinions.<br></p><p><em>THE UNION NO. 2, OR CHILD’S SECOND BOOK.</em></p><p>  This is a continuation of the first number, containing easy reading lessons,<br>  most of which are pleasing stories, designed to interest the mind of the<br>  learner and afford instruction.<br></p><p><em>THE UNION NO. 3, OR CHILD’S THIRD BOOK</em></p><p>  This is a gradual advance from the second number, having the reading and<br>  spelling lessons arranged on the same plan.<br></p><p>  <em>THE UNION NO. 4.</em>  A neat stereotype edition, also designed as a reading and spelling book, and<br>  containing a variety of other useful matter.<br></p><p>  <em>THE UNION NO. 5.</em>  A reading book for the higher classes in common schools, with spelling lessons<br>  and definitions adapted to each reading section—with tables, mental<br>  arithmetic, &amp;c.<br></p><p><em>SELECT READER, OR UNION NO. 6</em></p><p>  Being a selection of pieces in prose and verse, which can scarcely fail to<br>  interest the mind, improve the heart and inform the understanding; accompanied<br>  with an explanatory Key, containing much useful information; and a large<br>  collection of verbal distinctions with illustrations.<br></p><p>  500 pp. Designed as a reading book for the highest classes in Academies and<br>  Schools.<br></p><p>  The whole forming a series of interesting, useful and economical school books.<br></p><p>  They have been through several large editions, and the publishers have had the<br>  whole series stereotyped, so that future editions will be uniform in every<br>  respect. They have spared neither pains nor expense to render these School<br>  Books worthy of attention.<br></p><p>  These books are used exclusively in the Providence public schools; have<br>  obtained an extensive circulation in Philadelphia and other parts of<br>  Pennsylvania. They have been introduced into most of the enterprising and<br>  intelligent country towns in Rhode-Island, and many towns in other parts of<br>  the United States. The publishers have the pleasure to state that not a single<br>  teacher, or other competent person has, to their knowledge, ever disapproved<br>  of these books after having fairly examined them. Numerous testimonials are in<br>  possession of the publishers, from which they select the following.<br></p><p align="center"><em>RECOMMENDATIONS</em></p><p>  At a meeting of the Providence School Committee, the following resolution was<br>  introduced by a Sub-Committee, appointed to examine and report what school<br>  books they consider best for the use of the public schools:<br></p><p>  “<br>  <em>Resolved,</em>  That the arrangement and plan of the series of Common School Classics,<br>  compiled by Mr. Angell, meet our approbation.”<br></p><p>  Signed, WM.R. STAPLES, DAVID PICKERING,<br>  <em>Sub-Committee.</em></p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WATCHEMOKET<br>  FARM, 30<sup>th</sup>  Aug, 1833<br></p><p>  Dear Sir:—Among my political engagements, I have always found some leisure<br>  moments left me for literary amusement. The employment of the School Master,<br>  once so useful and dear to me, does now, at times, call me back to the<br>  examination of letters, syllables, words, spellings and readings. Perhaps I<br>  mingle with all these some political considerations; for I confess, that my<br>  anxiety for the preservation and perpetuation of our Union and National<br>  Government, is so great, that I often ardently wish all the children in the<br>  United States could be taught to read from the same set of books. Not because<br>  this might give a uniformity of pronunciation throughout the country, so<br>  desirable to Poets and Orators; but more than this, because the same juvenile<br>  literature studied and read, in the same language, would go far to give to<br>  each succeeding generation not only the same knowledge, but something like a<br>  brotherhood of feelings, sentiments, and opinions, than could, in any other<br>  way be obtained. I know you as a citizen, feel a deep interest in all this;<br>  and because you, as one of the highly useful and laborious fraternity of<br>  Printers and venders of books, may have a peculiar interest in some of those<br>  put forth for the instruction of children, I shall, at this time, press on<br>  your attention this subject in connexion with the best which I have yet seen.<br></p><p>  Our worthy fellow-citizen, Mr. Oliver Angell, seems to have had purposes much<br>  akin to my wishes, when he composed and published his system of classics for<br>  children. He had named his books the “Union;” and if you look quite through<br>  them, you will find nothing in the whole, for the reading of children, but<br>  that spirit and those principles which alone can preserve the Union, the<br>  purest morals, piety and patriotism. There is, also, a progression in the<br>  readings found in these books, admirably contrived to go along with that of<br>  the human mind in its growth from childhood up to perfect maturity.<br></p><p>  In mere orthography, the alphabet, the vowels, consonants, dipthongs,<br>  syllables, spellings, perhaps Mr. Angell might have done better for the<br>  <em>Instructor</em>  who may use his books; but after all, it will be found doubtful if any one can<br>  do better for the<br>  <em>Pupil</em>  for whom this good man seems alone to have been solicitous. The Instructor<br>  should carry in his head, the correct pronunciation of every word in our<br>  spoken language, and a key for all the various sounds of every letter in all<br>  its various combinations whenever he looks at that language as it is printed<br>  or written.<br></p><p>  We have more vowels in our spoken than in our printed or written language; and<br>  those who compose spelling books have supplied the deficiency by figures added<br>  to the printed character of each vowel. These Algebraic vowels, half letter,<br>  half figure, used in spelling books, are not printed in books of any other<br>  kind; so that a child, though he may have learned the different sounds of the<br>  printed vowels and can pronounce them when he spells; yet when he comes to<br>  read in other books, where one half of each vowel is omitted and it becomes<br>  thereby a new letter, he knows not how to pronounce it; and he must, at last,<br>  learn its different sounds in the different combinations of each with other<br>  letters. This would have been easier done, at first, when he was spelling,<br>  than, at last, when he is reading. Last or first, he must learn them, from the<br>  Instructor, or from the dictionary; and the Algebraic vowels, called the key,<br>  while useful to the Instructors themselves not well instructed, may be<br>  detrimental to the pupil. On the whole, I have seen no system of School Books<br>  equal, or any where near equal to Mr. Angell’s Union; and I think if they<br>  could be universally used in our English Schools in the whole country, our<br>  children would become not only better scholars, but better patriots, not less<br>  citizens of Rhode-Island, or South-Carolina and more citizens of the United<br>  States.<br></p><p>I am dear Sir, very truly, your obedient servant.</p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>  TRISTAM BURGES.<br></p><p>  <em>From the Preceptors of the Public Schools in the City of Providence</em></p><p>  We have used Mr. Angell’s series of school books, for nearly one eyar; and<br>  from this long trial we can say with confidence that we believe them admirably<br>  suited to answer the purposes for which they were composed. From our<br>  examination of the inferior numbers, which are used in the primary Schools, we<br>  believe them also to be no less useful. As reading books, they all combine in<br>  our opinion, many peculiar excellencies. The first, which will strike all who<br>  use them, is their perfect<br>  <em>adaptation</em>  to the<br>  <em>capacities</em>  of those for whom they were designed. This, we consider a most important<br>  advantage in an elementary book, and one which has not been heretofore<br>  sufficiently attended to.<br></p><p>  The books put into the hands of children at school have generally been<br>  altogether<br>  <em>above the understanding</em>  of the young mind; and the consequence has been, that the scholars have noy<br>  only made much less progress in a given time, but have acquired the lasting<br>  <em>disgust</em>  for their studies which has operated as an effectual bar to future<br>  improvement. To this great and extensive evil, Mr. Angell’s books afford a<br>  <em>certain and easy remedy.</em>  The facility with which his lessons are<br>  <em>understood</em>  added to their very interesting nature, causes them to be read by the scholar<br>  with eagerness and delight; by which means his love of study and his<br>  improvement in learning are both successfully promoted. The introduction of<br>  spelling lessons, in connection with reading lessons, into all the books, is<br>  an advantage which they possess over those previously in use. This<br>  arrangement, by enabling the pupil to become acquainted with each separate<br>  word, immediately before he is called to read them, is well calculated to<br>  render that exercise correct and pleasing, at the same time that it renders<br>  orthography a less dry and uninteresting study than the usual mode. It also<br>  considerably promotes economy by rendering the purchase of a separate spelling<br>  book unnecessary. The<br>  <em>appending of questions</em>  to each reading lesson we consider a very valuable improvement, since, by<br>  calling the attention of the pupil more closely to the subject, it will lead<br>  him to a better understanding of what is read. The natural gradation from what<br>  is easy, to what is more difficult, which is observed throughout this whole<br>  series, is a circumstance that renders them peculiarly valuable. Entertaining<br>  these opinions, we cheerfully recommend them to the attention of teachers and<br>  others interested in the cause of education; confident, that to all who are<br>  aware how much success in teaching depends upon proper books, they will be<br>  peculiarly acceptable. P.W. FERRIS, E.W. BAKER, ESEK ALDRICH, SILAS WESTON,<br>  RICHARD ANTHONY. Providence April 14<sup>th</sup>  , 1831.<br></p><p>  <em>    “The Committee on Education, appointed by the General Assembly of the State<br>    of Rhode-Island, Report,<br>  </em>  ‘That they have examined the series of Common School Classics, by Oliver<br>  Angell, A.M., and that the arrangement and plan of the said series of<br>  Committee the introduction of the same into the Public Schools of the State<br>  would be advantageous. Signed, “GEORGE G. KING,<br>  <em>For the Com.</em></p><p>PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 28. 1833.</p><p>  Gentlemen—I have examined with much care and satisfaction, the series of<br>  “Angell’s School Classics,” with which you were pleased to present me, and<br>  have not the slightest hesitation to pronounce it just such a set of reading<br>  books as has long been wanted in our schools. It is my intention, as soon as<br>  practicable, to adopt the whole series as standard reading books for my<br>  classes, and I doubt not that if the necessary exertions be made by those<br>  interested, they will ere long become a favorite standard in all our schools.<br>  I most cheerfully recommend them to the serious and immediate attention of my<br>  Philadelphia co-laborers in the field of Education. Very respectfully—Your<br>  ob’t Servant, J. O’CONNER. Principal of the Classical and English Academy,<br>  rear of St. Stephen’s Church, and Recording Secretary of the “Philadelphia<br>  Association of Teachers.”<br></p><p>  <em>    From Robert Vaux, Esq. of Philadelphia, who was for a number of years<br>    President of the Board of Controllers of the Public Schools for the City and<br>    County of Philadelphia.<br>  </em></p><p>  TO MARSHALL, CLARK &amp; CO. SCHOOL BOOK PUBLISHERS, PHILADELPHIA. In<br>  compliance with your request, I have examined “<br>  <em>Angell’s Union Series of Common School Classics,”</em>  and entertain a very favorable opinion of the work. It comprises a course of<br>  elementary lessons on simple and practical principles, and so far as I can<br>  discover, imparts throughout, knowledge to instruct the understanding and to<br>  purify the heart. In common with all productions of like character I could<br>  wish for extensive circulation in our country. ROBERT VAUX.<br></p><p>  <em>    From Roswell C. Smith, Esq. Author of “Practical and Mental Arithmetic,”<br>    “Productive Grammar,” “Introductory Arithmetic,” &amp;c.<br>  </em></p><p>  From an impression, received and corroborated by a long continued course of<br>  instruction, in regard to the best methods of communicating knowledge to the<br>  youthful mind, I am free to confess that the Spelling and reading Books, of<br>  which Mr. Oliver Angell is the author, are not excelled, in their adaption to<br>  the purposes for which they are intended by any other books with which I am<br>  acquainted. Their prominent characteristic is simplicity; and when the public<br>  mind has taken the stand, to which it seems rapidly advancing, that children<br>  and youth must understand what they read and what they learn, then at least<br>  the works of Mr. Angell will receive that patronage, which they so eminently<br>  deserve. This testimony in favor of that gentleman is designed not as a mere<br>  puff; but as a just tribute of praise to one who has labored long and<br>  faithfully for the public good. ROSWELL C. SMITH.<br></p><p>Hampton, February 12, 1833.</p><p>  ☞Teachers, School Committees are furnished gratuitously with sets for<br>  examination—orders from abroad promptly attended to.<br></p><p>  Providence, January 2,<br>  1834&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>  2<br></p>
