    <p>  The following communication from a christian, a philanthropist, and a<br>  gentleman, we insert with pleasure. The language is energetic, occasionally<br>  severe, but we hold not ourself answerable for its severity. The circumstances<br>  of the case justify it. Cruel charges, unsubstantiated by the least shadow of<br>  evidence, have been too frequently brought against Abolitionists, and we have<br>  a right to demand the proof or a retraction, and if neither is given, he who<br>  makes those charge is, to say the least, a traducer of character.<br></p><p><em>For the Unionist.</em></p><p>To the Editor of the Norwich Courier</p><p>  SIR—I presume that you will agree with me in the sentiment that the editor of<br>  a public journal is under weighty responsibilities, and should suffer nothing<br>  to appear in the columns of his publication but with extreme caution. Opinions<br>  disseminated through the columns of a newspaper will, to a greater or less<br>  degree, influence the opinions of the reading community, and when the editor<br>  of a paper advocates any particular doctrine, he doubtless desires that his<br>  readers may adhere to the same doctrine. Great care therefore is necessary<br>  that a person in your connexion with community should disseminate thro’ that<br>  community, precepts which shall bear the test of truth—principles founded upon<br>  the strictest rules of justice and sound morality. You sir, I presume,<br>  professing to be governed by high and honorable motives, will readily assent<br>  to this, and at all times be willing to turn your attention to any thing which<br>  may have escaped your pen, and if any one of your readers should be so<br>  unfortunate as to differ from you in sentiment, you will, I presume,<br>  cheerfully examine the ground of their complaints, to be convinced, or to show<br>  some reason for a different course.<br></p><p>  I would request of you, sir, to re-peruse an article which appeared under your<br>  editorial head, Oct. 23d, in relation to Miss Crandall’s school and the<br>  sentiments of the abolitionists. I would ask you to do it calmly and<br>  dispassionately—<br>  <em>searching for the truth</em>  —unbiased by opinions previously expressed, farther than you find<br>  <em>reason</em>  to be your supporter.<br></p><p>  You say, “Although we think that Miss Crandall has a right to continue her<br>  school we are by no means friendly to the doctrines which are said to be<br>  taught in it; yet these doctrines can never be put down by persecution—they<br>  must be met by fair argument, and in such a contest they will prove wholly<br>  untenable.” I am glad to find that you have never denied the<br>  <em>right</em>  of Miss Crandall to teach such a school—it is rather a matter or surprise to<br>  me, as it probably is to you, that New-England should contain an enlightened<br>  man who<br>  <em>would</em>  deny that right. I know not what doctrines you have heard to be taught in that<br>  school, neither have you seen fit to inform the public. But you have said that<br>  <em>dangerous</em>  doctrines are taught there that ought to be “put down.” If so, are not you,<br>  sir, bound to tell us what these doctrines are, as you wish to enlighten the<br>  public all you can—to overthrow these dangerous doctrines, and to free society<br>  from their contamination, will you not condescend to meet them by “fair<br>  argument,” as “in such a contest” you are confident “they will prove wholly<br>  untenable?” I am anxious to see, what I have never yet seen and feat I never<br>  shal, the attempt made to “put them down” by “fair argument,” instead of<br>  addled eggs, &amp;c.<br></p><p>  You say again, “The least that can be said of the Abolition scheme is that it<br>  is an<br>  <em>insane</em>  project—one which no man in the full possession and exercise of his faculties<br>  can contemplate as being practicable, or at the present time desirable.” I<br>  know, sir, it is very easy for a person, especially when under a little<br>  excitement, to go on and make severe accusations against his opponents, but it<br>  is quite another thing to show the reason of these accusations. I might say<br>  that the editor of the Norwich Courier was governed by passion and prejudice,<br>  with as much ease as you charge Abolitionists of insanity; and I doubt not,<br>  sir, that I should be able to substantiate my charge as soon as you yours. I<br>  have seen similar charges in your paper before, but I have never known of your<br>  being more particular. You are satisfied with making a general assertion, why<br>  not specify wherein this insanity consists? The leading doctrine of the<br>  Abolitionists is that no man has a right to hold his fellow man in bondage a<br>  single moment. Is this insane? Is it untrue? Is it a fact that man<br>  <em>has a right</em>  to rob his fellow man of liberty—of<br>  <em>himself?</em>  If he<br>  <em>has</em>  such a right, tell me, sir, who gave him that right, and how long it is to<br>  continue. If he has a<br>  <em>right</em>  to hold him in bondage<br>  <em>one</em>  moment, how many moments may he have that right? But who are these insane<br>  Abolitionists? How long since this spirit of insanity come upon them? They are<br>  all around you—men of distinguished worth—of brilliant talents—to whom you,<br>  sire, in your highest estimation of yourself, never considered yourself worthy<br>  to be called an equal. You accuse them of forwarding a project which is not<br>  desirable. Do you pronounce them all hypocrites? No, you dare not, but they<br>  are<br>  <em>insane,</em>  and therefore may be, for aught you know, sincere. But they are men of<br>  exemplary piety—men of fervent prayer—of extensive influence in promoting the<br>  cause of our Redeemer. You have not been accustomed to pronounce them<br>  insane—even now you are ready to quote their opinions upon other subjects and<br>  would place more confidence in their judgment than in your own. How happens it<br>  that their insanity is confined to this subject alone?<br></p><p>  You say, “The agitators appear to have bid adieu to common sense and a regard<br>  for the constitution and the laws,” &amp;c. I know not what you call bidding<br>  adieu to common sense, but one thing I know, that the leading Abolitionists in<br>  our country are the leading men in every other project to benefit the human<br>  race—men distinguished for their moral courage, seeking for the approval of<br>  God rather than for the favor of man. They have inquired for the path of duty<br>  and having ascertained it they have not failed to run in that path. Some,<br>  perhaps, might say that common sense in this respect is a disposition to act<br>  in a manner most congenial with popular feeling, If this is your definition of<br>  the term, I admit that they have ‘bid adieu to common sense,’ but as I<br>  understand the term they have most strictly adhered to it.<br></p><p>  As for the charge of their disregarding the constitution and the laws, I think<br>  it a very grave accusation to be brought against many of the best men of our<br>  country. But you, sir, are not the only one who has seen fit to make<br>  it—neither are you the only one who has made it without specifying what part<br>  of the constitution or what laws they disregard—and I must tell you, sire,<br>  that neither you nor all the wholesale accusers who you join<br>  <em>can</em>  point out a single line of our constitution from which Abolitionists, as such,<br>  have departed. “Bid adieu to a regard for the constitution!” It is not<br>  true—and I here call upon you, sir, to clear your character from the<br>  imputation of falsehood. I would not say, sir, that you<br>  <em>intended</em>  to assert an untruth, but I<br>  <em>do</em>  say that you<br>  <em>have</em>  asserted one, and unless you retract or substantiate it, the charge of<br>  falsehood must rest upon you. Is it unconstitutional to assert that it is<br>  morally wrong to hold slaves? Does the constitution of a free, republican<br>  people forbid that we should<br>  <em>speak against</em>  chaining the mortal body and degrading the immortal mind? Is it against the<br>  constitution of a Christian people to declaim against the cruel system of<br>  slavery? —to say that it is contrary to the righteous laws of God—that it is<br>  inconsistent with the spirit of the gospel and the precepts of our Savior? Is<br>  it a fact that the<br>  <em>republicans</em>  of the United States hold one sixth of their number in the chains of the<br>  verist despotism—that<br>  <em>two millions</em>  of our fellow creatures are groaning under worse than Egyptian servitude—that<br>  <em>two million</em>  of immortal souls are shut out from the light of science and closed to the<br>  entrance of one cheering ray from the Sun of Righteousness—and that when a few<br>  fearless men stand forth and say that these things are<br>  <em>wrong,</em>  you, the editor of a public journal, cry out that in so saying they have “bid<br>  adieu to a regard for the constitution?” Tell me, sir, if these things are<br>  facts? O that you could tell me that they were not facts! But, alas! they are.<br>  We must not say that it is<br>  <em>wrong</em>  to degrade the image of God to a level with the brutes that perish, for it is<br>  unconstitutional. Thank God!&nbsp; we have no such constitution as this! Shame<br>  on my countrymen! Shame on any republican asserting such a doctrine! I know<br>  the constitution<br>  <em>permits</em>  the several states to hold slaves if they choose—but no where does it say that<br>  we<br>  <em>shall not</em>  raise our voices against this abominable system. Wherein, then, have<br>  Abolitionists “bid adieu to a regard for the constitution?” Will you, sir,<br>  point out this treason, or cease longer to make an unfounded accusation?<br></p><p>  You say, “That this unprincipled opposition to the labors of the Colonization<br>  Society will raise up many warm friends to the latter there is abundant ground<br>  to hope.” As “unprincipled,: sir, as these ‘agitators’ may be, I deem it no<br>  disparagement to you to say that they are mi int eh splendor of whose moral<br>  qualities you would be hardly visible, and whose names will be breathed with<br>  veneration by the virtuous and the good when yours shall have long been<br>  forgotten. But I am perfectly willing that you should, if you can, console<br>  yourself that by this opposition many warm friends will be raised up to the<br>  Colonization Society, but perhaps it may soften future disappointment, to<br>  inform you that many of those who have been :warm friends” to that society are<br>  flocking around the Abolition standard, and however many ‘warm friends’ the<br>  Colonization Society may have, the cause of Abolition must forever stand. AS<br>  long as justice reigns in heaven and sin is found on earth, so long will those<br>  be found who will exert themselves to hasten the triumph of the former and<br>  crush and extirpate the latter, and as sure as God is good so sure will he<br>  cause them to prosper.<br></p><p>  Again you say, “If the blacks are to be benefitted at all, it can only be<br>  accomplished by the aid of the Colonization Society, and their removal to<br>  Africa.” O that you had spared the penning of that sentence! What principle do<br>  you mean to advocate? Into what would you convert our happy land? What, sir,<br>  shall we think of the man, professing to be governed by that religion which<br>  commands us to love our neighbor as ourselves, who tells us that here are two<br>  and a half millions of immortal beings among us, degraded and wretched, and if<br>  they “are to be benefitted at all” it must be by “their removal to Africa?”<br>  What, in the name of God, is the reason they cannot be benefitted here? What<br>  but that you and some of your brother editors are so wickedly prejudiced<br>  against them that you are determined they<br>  <em>shall not be?</em>  They<br>  <em>can</em>  be benefitted here—they<br>  <em>will</em>  be benefitted here. The number of blacks in this country will never be less<br>  than at the present moment—for in the first place we have not the means to<br>  make them less, increasing as they do 70,000 per year, and in the second place<br>  if we had the means of carrying them to Africa they do not want to go. They<br>  must always remain with us unless we serve them as we have served the poor<br>  Indians, and though you may continue to assert that they must always remain<br>  degraded, yet ever true Christian will rejoice that God in his good providence<br>  has ordered it otherwise.<br></p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>  JUSTICE.<br></p>
