  SALISBURY CATHEDRAL—STONEHENGE—THE SHEPHERD OF SALISBURY PLAIN
</p>
<p align="right">
  <em>Salisbury, July</em>
  2, 1833.
</p>
<p>
  The shepherd of Salisbury Plain, Stonehenge, Old Sarum, and Salisbury
  Cathedral are things of some note. The latter is distinguished for its lofty
  spire, four hundred feet; for the purity and uniformity of its architecture,
  external and internal; and for the warped condition of the columns of masonry,
  which support the tower and spire, under the amazing weight that rests upon
  them, and then look us and observe [indecipherable] ready to be crushed. And
  the only reason why it is presumed they will remain, is because they have
  already endured for ages under the same appearances. An extra fixture has been
  thrown in for protection, interposing a monstrous blemish in the perspective
  of the transept. Aside from this the pure Gothic of the entire edifice,
  constitutes the rarest beauty of the kind in the British Isles. It was built
  in the thirteenth century—the spire having been since added, the top of which
  inclines 22 inches from a perpendicular line, in consequence of the warping of
  its supports. An old man now between seventy and eighty, has been accustomed
  to ascend once in a twelve month for many years to oil the weather vane. He
  gets out at a window a few feet below the top, scrambles like a squirrel by
  some iron net work at the giddy elevation of four hundred feet, performs his
  office, and descends with all the self-possession of a sailor. This year,
  however, he has been unable to do his duty on account of the infirmities of
  age.
</p>
<p>
  I rode this morning in a fly, a sort of hackney-coach, drawn by a couple of
  mules, to
  <em>Stonehenge,</em>
  about eight miles from the town, situated in the heart of Salisbury plain, and
  standing insolated in all the grandeur of its mysterious and hitherto
  unexplained history. It is a truly sublime object—sublime in itself, as
  filling the mind with wonder, where the stones came from, how they could have
  been brought there, and placed in their relative positions! The heaviest
  columns are rated at seventy tons—the whole number being ninety-four, as near
  as can be ascertained, although the present confusion of the assemblage
  renders it difficult to count them. It is supposed to have been a Druidical
  temple, where human sacrifices were offered—a superstition as sublime as it
  was diabolical, as mysterious as cruel! The rude grandeur of the work
  demonstrates the barbarity of the age. There are no indications, that this
  place of sacrifice was ever enclosed by walls, or covered by a roof. It is
  encircled indeed by the traces of a ditch and a corresponding embankment, and
  the columnar ranges of stones were set up in circular lines, at greater
  distance from each other than the space occupied. About half an acre is
  enclosed by the circumvallation, and a quarter of an acre occupied by the
  temple itself. The only junction of the structure if structure it can be
  called, appears to have been the resting of the amazing cross and horizontal
  slabs on the largest columns, about 20 ft. high &amp; 15 asunder, most of
  which have fallen, some are inclined, and a few only standing erect. Tenons
  were left on the top of the perpendicular columns, entering grooves of the
  horizontal pieces laid upon them. It is barely possible, that the mechanical
  powers of the present age could set up an edifice like this; but the rudeness
  of the work does not naturally suggest the knowledge and application of such
  powers at the time of its creation. Hence the wonder.
</p>
<p>
  It is said by some, that the same material is not to be found in this island.
  It is incredible, however, that these immense rocks should have been shipped;
  and almost equally incredible, that they should have been transported any
  considerable distance on trundles; and yet they were never found in this
  vicinity. Many of them are reduced to nearly right angles, but more exhibit a
  smooth, or properly plane surface. There is nothing like the skill of masonry
  bestowed upon them. They are perhaps purposely left in this rude state, as
  emblematic of the stern and inexorable rites which they were set up to
  witness. The supposed altar piece lies in the centre, embedded in the earth,
  and directly behind it two of the largest columns supported the heaviest
  cross-beam—but the columns have inclined and dropped their burden.
</p>
<p>
  There are other relics of the kind in the island, but none so stupendous. All
  the parts of a similar temple have been transferred at great expense from the
  island of Jersey, and set up on the estate of a private gentleman at
  Henley-on-Thames, now the property of a Mr. Maitland. I stumbled upon it the
  other day in rambling over the grounds with a friend, and found it perched on
  a hill some four or five hundred feet above the bed of the Thames. It was
  brought over by a former governor of the island, Gen. Conway, who then owned
  Park-place, on which it now stands. It is of course a small chapel, compared
  with
  <em>Stonehenge</em>
  on Salisbury Plain—but many of the stones are of several tons weight. They are
  rude and shapeless.
</p>
<p>
  There are numerous marks of ancient military fortifications, scattered over
  Salisbury Plain; and tumuli of the ancient dead, such as are to be found in
  the Western regions of our own country, lift up their heads in various
  quarters, and sometimes in groups.
</p>
<p>
  Old Sarum, of recent fame, as a rotten borough of England, sending two members
  to Parliament under the late
  <em>regime</em>
  , is a naked fortification in ruins, two miles from Salisbury. It is as
  desolate as the crown of Ben Nevis in Scotland.
</p>
<p>
  My sensations in visiting Stonehenge were the result of a singular combination
  of the grateful recollections of Mrs. More’s Shepherd and his family, and of
  the actual scenes before me. “The Shepherd of Salisbury Plain” was continually
  ringing in my ear, and all his history passing before me, as I rode over these
  undulating, naked, and apparently boundless fields, among the tumuli and
  traces of ancient fortifications, and came at last to gaze upon and admire
  this wonder-exciting and unaccountable relic of a barbarous age and bloody
  superstition. What a demonstration of man’s susceptibilities of religious
  affections, of a sense of guilt, of his need of atonement, and of the dreadful
  errors, into which he may be plunged without the guidance of a divine
  revelation!

     <h3>About this Item</h3>
       <p>While it is interesting that this occupies part of page one, in the very midst of the trial over the Black Law, the discussion about religious sensibilities in this reflective travelogue certainly speaks to the Romantic spirit, and the emergence in New England of Emersonian Transcendentalism at this same time. Hannah More (1745-1833), the author of <em>The Sheperd of Salisbury Plain</em>, was an important female voice in English-language literature of the time, though not well-known today. </p>
