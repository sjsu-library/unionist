    <p>  “Some two or three&nbsp; weeks since we published, upon authority so<br>  respectable as to have been considered altogether unquestionable, an account<br>  of the unwelcome reception of the Rev. Captain Stuart, of Great Britain, in<br>  the town of Plainfield, Conn., together with a statement as to his rather<br>  forcible expulsion from that place. It appears that the account received by us<br>  was not altogether correct; but wherein it was incorrect, we have not been<br>  able exactly to ascertain. But for the style of rudeness with which we have<br>  been assailed upon&nbsp; this subject, we should have noted the inaccuracy of<br>  the account communicated to us before, although we had not the means of<br>  correcting it. All the papers contradicting our version of&nbsp; the affair,<br>  have admitted that disturbances did&nbsp; attend Captain Stuart’s visit to<br>  Plainfield, but have not informed us&nbsp; as to particulars. The<br>  <em>Emancipator</em>  of yesterday, commences an article this:—<br></p><p>  “THE AFFAIR AT PLAINFIELD.—Our readers probably know that during the height of<br>  the late reign of terror in New York, the Editor of the N.Y. Commercial<br>  Advertiser, “more the organ of the&nbsp; Colonization Society than any other<br>  in this city,” endeavored to keep himself and his mob in countenance by a<br>  ludicrous and apparently approving account of a mob said to have taken place<br>  in Plainfield, Conn., in which the farmers of that place were described as<br>  literally driving Charles Stuart out of town with their cart whips.<br>  <em>The story was not true.</em>  —But it was true that some unmannerly boys attempted, without success, to<br>  disturb the lecture. The following is extracted from an&nbsp; account given in<br>  the Brooklyn (Ct.) Unionist:<br></p><p>  “We have called them<br>  <em>gentlemen,</em>  though had they been strangers to us, had we not been personally acquainted<br>  with them, known their high pretensions, the respectability of their<br>  parentage, their advantages for learning what belongs to the character of a<br>  gentleman, and that on many occasions&nbsp; they show that they<br>  <em>do</em>  know how to conduct with propriety, there is much reason to&nbsp; fear that<br>  their disorderly behaviour, their indecency and rudeness of language and<br>  action, would have led us to rank them with the lowest vulgar. As it is,<br>  however, the graduate of Yale, the undergraduate of another college, the<br>  students in the academy, the sons of wealthy and respectable citizens of<br>  Plainfield, of church members and zealous colonizationists,<br>  <em>    (for the parents of every Plainfield youth whom we {noted?] in the rabble,<br>    are decided ‘Colonizationists’) must, we suppose, be called gentlemen, be<br>    their conduct what it may.—<br>  </em>  Much good may the name do them, and may they yet learn to deserve it, though<br>  we fear ‘twill be a hard lesson for some of them, [undecipherable] any truth<br>  in the maxims of moralists respecting the [undecipherable]<br></p><p>  [undecipherable] than one exception, we<br>  <em>know,</em>  and we think [undecipherable]{end of Unionist quote and, by implication, of<br>  Emancipator quote}<br></p><p>  Now in the first place, the introductory&nbsp; remarks of the Emancipator are<br>  not true. Our account of the Plainfield disturbance<br>  <em>was not</em>  published “during the height of the late reign of terror,” but when all was<br>  tranquil in the week following [my note – it was published July 15<sup>th</sup>  – notes in main PC file];—and in the second place, the account of the Brooklyn<br>  Unionist, (an&nbsp; abolition paper published in the neighborhood of<br>  Plainfield,) represents the case, if anything, more unfavorably than we<br>  did.—Indeed our mistake seems to have consisted only in stating that the young<br>  men cracked their whips while Mr. Stuart was forcibly placed in his waggon<br>  (sic). Upon this point, then, we stand corrected.<br></p><p>  But a communication under the signature of Captain Stuart himself, which<br>  appears in the Emancipator, with the prefatory remark that it “was refused<br>  publication in the Commercial Advertiser,” calls for a few observations. It<br>  was not because he attempted to correct an error into which it is<br>  [indecipherable] fallen, that we objected to the publication of his<br>  article—for that we would very cheerfully [indecipherable] done at any time.<br>  Our objection arose not only from the inflammatory character of the<br>  communication, as a while, but from a more weighty consideration still. We<br>  entirely object to the visit of Captain Stuart among us, as being not only<br>  uncalled for, but highly improper; and it would be the highth of imprudence<br>  for him, again to appear before the public, on the subject of his mission,<br>  either in print, in the pulpit, or at the forum. He seems to be an amiable,<br>  and we doubt not a good man; but he has no business in this country on such<br>  an&nbsp; errand. How, for instance, would it be received for an American to<br>  repair to England, for the purpose of delivering lectures in favor repealing<br>  the Act of Union between England and Ireland! Such interference in the<br>  internal affairs of another nation, would not be permitted, and any<br>  <em>foreign agent</em>  attempting it, would very properly be prevented from opening his lips. The<br>  principle, it will be seen, is precisely the same.<br></p><p>  But Mr. Stuart, it appears, is not long to be the only agent from abroad,<br>  engaged in the work of enlightening our country on the subject of its<br>  own&nbsp; domestic and social relations. He is soon to be joined by a Mr.<br>  Thompson, who is understood to be on his way hither&nbsp; as a Missionary from<br>  some excellent ladies of Glasgow. Mr. Thompson is said to be an able and an<br>  eloquent man; but we trust that on his arrival amongst us, he will perceive<br>  the propriety of withholding any displays, either of his talents or his<br>  rhetoric, on the subject of his mission.—Indeed—and we say it deliberately,<br>  though with all kindness—we hold that neither Mr. Stuart, nor Mr. Thompson,<br>  nor any other strangers from abroad, should be permitted to convoke and<br>  harangue an American assembly upon this question. We doubt not the goodness of<br>  their intentions; but they are laboring under a sad mistake, as to the path of<br>  duty. If they have feelings of kindness for the slaves of this country, let<br>  them remain in their own; or else, if they choose, let them imitate a King and<br>  a Van Rensselaer, and go among the slaves to preach the Gospel in a manner<br>  compatible with the laws and usages of those States. The truth is, these<br>  excellent, though misjudging, philanthropists, do not understand the real nad<br>  inherent difficulties of the case, arising from the&nbsp; essential difference<br>  in the structures of our respective governments. The British Constitution is<br>  unwritten, consisting, in fact, of the common law of the realm. Parliament is<br>  omnipotent; and it had a perfect right, politically speaking, to abolish the<br>  slavery of its colonies at a blow, if it chose to do so.—Nor—residing as they<br>  do at a distance of four thousand miles from the colonies—could they<br>  understand of appreciate the difficulties, and the long train of evils, that<br>  must inevitably follow in the train of hasty and rash legislation, upon a<br>  question at once so important and so delicate.<br></p><p>  But it is not so in the United States. We live under a written Constitution,<br>  conferring certain powers upon the general government, and specifically<br>  withholding others; and among the powers thus reserved, is that of interfering<br>  with the domestic relations of the several States. So that although&nbsp; the<br>  general government is paramount in some respects, neither it, nor the state<br>  governments, nor the people of the free states, have any more right to<br>  interfere with the slave question, than they have to interfere with the<br>  nobility and the serfs of Russia, or the manufacturers and their operatives in<br>  England, or on the question of repealing the Irish Union. The truth—and every<br>  day’s experience more thoroughly convinces us of the fact—that the slave<br>  question must be left with&nbsp; the state governments, and the people where<br>  the evil exists. They understand the subject better than we do; they best know<br>  how to mitigate its rigors; and, ultimately, to apply the means of cure.<br>  Meantime let the efforts of American Christians and philanthropists be<br>  directed in the best and most efficient, and yet legal and inoffensive manner,<br>  to the moral and social improvement of the slave population, with a view to<br>  their gradual and ultimate emancipation. Depend upon it, the true method of<br>  improving the conditions of the slaves, and preparing them for that freedom<br>  which they must one day be put in possession of, is to pursue a kind and<br>  conciliatory course towards their masters. To abuse and exasperate them, can<br>  have only the&nbsp; follow effect, viz: that of binding the fetters of the<br>  slave more strongly—excluding information from him more rigidly—and<br>  protracting the period of his servitude indefinitely.<br></p><p>  With these views we deprecate all improper interference upon the subject. It<br>  regard to Messrs. Stuart and Thompson, we would treat them with all possible<br>  hospitality and kindness. We could not allow a finger to be&nbsp; raised<br>  against them, nor a hair of their heads to be injured.—But they&nbsp; should<br>  neither of them be allowed again to make any public show in&nbsp; any town,<br>  city, or village, north of the State of Delaware, upon this subject. We desire<br>  that it may be perfectly understood, wherever these foreign agents may present<br>  themselves to agitate the slave question, that they shall not be&nbsp; heard.<br>  They have no business here upon such a mission. And measures at once the most<br>  peaceable and effectual, should be adopted to prevent them from scattering<br>  fire-brands, arrows and death amongst us.<br></p>
