    <p>   “Some two or three&nbsp; weeks since we published, upon authority so   respectable as to have been considered altogether unquestionable, an account   of the unwelcome reception of the Rev. Captain Stuart, of Great Britain, in   the town of Plainfield, Conn., together with a statement as to his rather   forcible expulsion from that place. It appears that the account received by us   was not altogether correct; but wherein it was incorrect, we have not been   able exactly to ascertain. But for the style of rudeness with which we have   been assailed upon&nbsp; this subject, we should have noted the inaccuracy of   the account communicated to us before, although we had not the means of   correcting it. All the papers contradicting our version of&nbsp; the affair,   have admitted that disturbances did&nbsp; attend Captain Stuart’s visit to   Plainfield, but have not informed us&nbsp; as to particulars. The   <em>Emancipator</em>   of yesterday, commences an article this:— </p> <p>   “THE AFFAIR AT PLAINFIELD.—Our readers probably know that during the height of   the late reign of terror in New York, the Editor of the N.Y. Commercial   Advertiser, “more the organ of the&nbsp; Colonization Society than any other   in this city,” endeavored to keep himself and his mob in countenance by a   ludicrous and apparently approving account of a mob said to have taken place   in Plainfield, Conn., in which the farmers of that place were described as   literally driving Charles Stuart out of town with their cart whips.   <em>The story was not true.</em>   —But it was true that some unmannerly boys attempted, without success, to   disturb the lecture. The following is extracted from an&nbsp; account given in   the Brooklyn (Ct.) Unionist: </p> <p>   “We have called them   <em>gentlemen,</em>   though had they been strangers to us, had we not been personally acquainted   with them, known their high pretensions, the respectability of their   parentage, their advantages for learning what belongs to the character of a   gentleman, and that on many occasions&nbsp; they show that they   <em>do</em>   know how to conduct with propriety, there is much reason to&nbsp; fear that   their disorderly behaviour, their indecency and rudeness of language and   action, would have led us to rank them with the lowest vulgar. As it is,   however, the graduate of Yale, the undergraduate of another college, the   students in the academy, the sons of wealthy and respectable citizens of   Plainfield, of church members and zealous colonizationists,   <em>     (for the parents of every Plainfield youth whom we {noted?] in the rabble,     are decided ‘Colonizationists’) must, we suppose, be called gentlemen, be     their conduct what it may.—   </em>   Much good may the name do them, and may they yet learn to deserve it, though   we fear ‘twill be a hard lesson for some of them, [undecipherable] any truth   in the maxims of moralists respecting the [undecipherable] </p> <p>   [undecipherable] than one exception, we   <em>know,</em>   and we think [undecipherable]{end of Unionist quote and, by implication, of   Emancipator quote} </p> <p>   Now in the first place, the introductory&nbsp; remarks of the Emancipator are   not true. Our account of the Plainfield disturbance   <em>was not</em>   published “during the height of the late reign of terror,” but when all was   tranquil in the week following [my note – it was published July 15   <sup>th</sup>   – notes in main PC file];—and in the second place, the account of the Brooklyn   Unionist, (an&nbsp; abolition paper published in the neighborhood of   Plainfield,) represents the case, if anything, more unfavorably than we   did.—Indeed our mistake seems to have consisted only in stating that the young   men cracked their whips while Mr. Stuart was forcibly placed in his waggon   (sic). Upon this point, then, we stand corrected. </p> <p>   But a communication under the signature of Captain Stuart himself, which   appears in the Emancipator, with the prefatory remark that it “was refused   publication in the Commercial Advertiser,” calls for a few observations. It   was not because he attempted to correct an error into which it is   [indecipherable] fallen, that we objected to the publication of his   article—for that we would very cheerfully [indecipherable] done at any time.   Our objection arose not only from the inflammatory character of the   communication, as a while, but from a more weighty consideration still. We   entirely object to the visit of Captain Stuart among us, as being not only   uncalled for, but highly improper; and it would be the highth of imprudence   for him, again to appear before the public, on the subject of his mission,   either in print, in the pulpit, or at the forum. He seems to be an amiable,   and we doubt not a good man; but he has no business in this country on such   an&nbsp; errand. How, for instance, would it be received for an American to   repair to England, for the purpose of delivering lectures in favor repealing   the Act of Union between England and Ireland! Such interference in the   internal affairs of another nation, would not be permitted, and any   <em>foreign agent</em>   attempting it, would very properly be prevented from opening his lips. The   principle, it will be seen, is precisely the same. </p> <p>   But Mr. Stuart, it appears, is not long to be the only agent from abroad,   engaged in the work of enlightening our country on the subject of its   own&nbsp; domestic and social relations. He is soon to be joined by a Mr.   Thompson, who is understood to be on his way hither&nbsp; as a Missionary from   some excellent ladies of Glasgow. Mr. Thompson is said to be an able and an   eloquent man; but we trust that on his arrival amongst us, he will perceive   the propriety of withholding any displays, either of his talents or his   rhetoric, on the subject of his mission.—Indeed—and we say it deliberately,   though with all kindness—we hold that neither Mr. Stuart, nor Mr. Thompson,   nor any other strangers from abroad, should be permitted to convoke and   harangue an American assembly upon this question. We doubt not the goodness of   their intentions; but they are laboring under a sad mistake, as to the path of   duty. If they have feelings of kindness for the slaves of this country, let   them remain in their own; or else, if they choose, let them imitate a King and   a Van Rensselaer, and go among the slaves to preach the Gospel in a manner   compatible with the laws and usages of those States. The truth is, these   excellent, though misjudging, philanthropists, do not understand the real nad   inherent difficulties of the case, arising from the&nbsp; essential difference   in the structures of our respective governments. The British Constitution is   unwritten, consisting, in fact, of the common law of the realm. Parliament is   omnipotent; and it had a perfect right, politically speaking, to abolish the   slavery of its colonies at a blow, if it chose to do so.—Nor—residing as they   do at a distance of four thousand miles from the colonies—could they   understand of appreciate the difficulties, and the long train of evils, that   must inevitably follow in the train of hasty and rash legislation, upon a   question at once so important and so delicate. </p> <p>   But it is not so in the United States. We live under a written Constitution,   conferring certain powers upon the general government, and specifically   withholding others; and among the powers thus reserved, is that of interfering   with the domestic relations of the several States. So that although&nbsp; the   general government is paramount in some respects, neither it, nor the state   governments, nor the people of the free states, have any more right to   interfere with the slave question, than they have to interfere with the   nobility and the serfs of Russia, or the manufacturers and their operatives in   England, or on the question of repealing the Irish Union. The truth—and every   day’s experience more thoroughly convinces us of the fact—that the slave   question must be left with&nbsp; the state governments, and the people where   the evil exists. They understand the subject better than we do; they best know   how to mitigate its rigors; and, ultimately, to apply the means of cure.   Meantime let the efforts of American Christians and philanthropists be   directed in the best and most efficient, and yet legal and inoffensive manner,   to the moral and social improvement of the slave population, with a view to   their gradual and ultimate emancipation. Depend upon it, the true method of   improving the conditions of the slaves, and preparing them for that freedom   which they must one day be put in possession of, is to pursue a kind and   conciliatory course towards their masters. To abuse and exasperate them, can   have only the&nbsp; follow effect, viz: that of binding the fetters of the   slave more strongly—excluding information from him more rigidly—and   protracting the period of his servitude indefinitely. </p> <p>   With these views we deprecate all improper interference upon the subject. It   regard to Messrs. Stuart and Thompson, we would treat them with all possible   hospitality and kindness. We could not allow a finger to be&nbsp; raised   against them, nor a hair of their heads to be injured.—But they&nbsp; should   neither of them be allowed again to make any public show in&nbsp; any town,   city, or village, north of the State of Delaware, upon this subject. We desire   that it may be perfectly understood, wherever these foreign agents may present   themselves to agitate the slave question, that they shall not be&nbsp; heard.   They have no business here upon such a mission. And measures at once the most   peaceable and effectual, should be adopted to prevent them from scattering   fire-brands, arrows and death amongst us. </p>
