I asked Captain Hough to inform you that I would purchase seats  sufficient for my scholars if agreeable to you, if not, any part or portion of  the meeting house you might see fit for us to occupy, would be acceptable. Of  this Mr. Hough said he informed you. Dr. Harris, in answer, said we might  occupy the seat in the gallery appropriated to colored persons. Mr. Hough then  remarked that the seat would not be sufficient for the scholars—Deacon Bacon  then replied, that we might take the next pews until we had enough to be  seated.</p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp; Truly I said to the Committee that visited me in February  last—The scholars who come here shall not trouble you on the Sabbath, for we  can have preaching, either by colored or white ministers in our own house. The  committee made me no reply at the time if I am not mistaken, and I think I am  not.</p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp; Upon mature consideration (as regular preaching here was not very  readily obtained) I considered that I had done entirely wrong in depriving my  scholars of the privilege of attending religious worship in this village.</p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp; These are my reasons for asking the privilege of entering your  church; and all the licence I have received is as given above.</p><p align=\"center\">  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yours  with respect,</p><p>P.

It was, that they might secure to their posterity, if not to themselves, the rights of man, the blessings of civil and religious liberty, the prerogative of self-government. Who, when he reflects that this was their object, and how steadily they kept it in view, can hesitate to accord to them a higher praise, than is due to the founders of any other nation? It was, let us repeat, the moral character of the American Revolution, which gave it its peculiar grandeur. Do you feel any veneration, any love for Washington and his com-patriots, merely on account of the bloody battles they fought? You ought not. You should recoil with horror from scenes of blood, let the actors in them have been who they may. The heroes of our Revolution, it is true, fought bravely, desperately. But this alone would be equivocal applause. It was the purity of their intentions, their self-devotion to the cause of Liberty, which makes them deservedly the pride of our country, and the honor of our race. The battles which they fought, the thousands of fellow-beings whom they slew, were incidents in the prosecution of their undertaking, which the benevolent can never think of, but with sorrow and loathing.</p><p>It is then, we say again, the great moral purpose of the Revolution, which commends it, and those who conducted it, to our most grateful remembrance. How ardent and unfeigned they were in their love of Liberty, is evident not more in what they did and suffered during the contest, than in the provisions they afterwards made for the protection of our rights.— Ere they had laid aside their arms, all fresh from the scenes of danger and of loss through which they had passed, our fathers instituted a form of government, which excluded themselves no less than it excluded others from all distinctions of honor or profit, but such as their fellow citizens might freely accord to them. The principles on which they based our civil fabric are broad and deep. Their recognition of these as the only just foundation of human governments, gives us the clearest evidence that they were men of high intellectual power, and of unparalleled integrity. They promulgated doctrines, the truth and value of which are not yet fully realized. Hereafter, their wisdom and foresight will be more justly, that is to say, more highly appreciated. — Certain momentous questions are now agitating our Republic, and others are soon coming up to trouble us, which might at once be settled by a candid appeal to the constitution which they bequeathed us. —If we guide our political and religious affairs by the plain principles therein propounded, we shall avert those evils, which now threaten our very existence as a united people. But if we disregard them, the most fearful consequences are inevitable.</p><p>Our fathers declared that all men are created equal, with a right to freedom — A declaration of infinite import! A glorious, gospel, heaven inspired truth! If we deeply feel and duly regard this, whose rights or feelings shall we violate? This is a truth which ought to be indelibly engraven on every heart. It should control all the measures of government, and the deportment of individuals towards each other. It is <em>the</em> truth, out of which arise those principles, that should guide the intercourse of man with man, and of one community with another, both in respect to their civil and their religious concerns. It is but a new version of our Saviour’s golden rule.</p><p>By the result of those measures, which were determined upon fifty-seven years ago, we have been called unto liberty. Let us seriously reflect upon the nature and extent of the blessing, that we may not use it for an occasion to the flesh, but in willing obedience to God and his Christ, whose service alone is perfect freedom.</p><p>Think not, brethren, that ye are free because your fathers threw of the yoke of colonial subjection. Think not that ye are free because ye have no king, nor hereditary nobility to reign over you. Think not that ye are free because ye live in a country where the supreme power is in the hands of the people. Such are indeed the highly favorable circumstances of your condition; and yet you may be in bondage, more abject than that from which our fathers were delivered. You may be in bondage to the majority, whose will, if the principles of our constitution be forgotten, may become as absolute and arbitrary as the will of any despot. You may be the creatures of your own party or sect, to whose opinions you may be compelled to assent, and in whose projects you may be obliged to toil, on pain of expulsion from their ranks, and the odium of an outcast. Or worse than all, you may be the slaves of some prevailing vice, or of some wicked or foolish custom.</p><p>It was obviously the intention of those who framed our constitution, to sustain every man in forming his own opinions on all subjects, and in acting in accordance with his own opinions, unless they would lead him to violate the equal rights of another. But there are indications every where, that this wise intention of our fathers has already come to be often disregarded. Unmindful of their high individual responsibility, the mass of our people, instead of examining and judging for themselves, seem willing that others should shape their opinions and guide their actions. Though they loudly boast of their freedom, they are the humble servants of “the few.” In consequence, they have become arrayed in parties and sects, the country over, with their general and subordinate leaders, and their organs of inter-communication. What their leaders declare to them, they believe too often, it is feared, without inquiry. Whithersoever their leaders go, they follow, nothing doubting. This is, we believe, too just an account of our religious and political affairs. It is rarely, very rarely, that we see an individual thinking and acting without an undue defence to some party. — How continually do we perceive in large bodies of men, a sameness of opinion and a unity of action, which there could not, would not be, if it were not for some <em>master</em> minds controlling them with absolute authority. Ye have witnessed the struggles of the rival factions in our land. Have ye thought their zeal has been according to knowledge? Have ye seen reason to believe that the individuals, on either side, thoroughly understood the merits of their cause? And that each one acted as his own best judgment and kind feelings dictated? Has it not rather been apparent to you that the individual merged himself in his party, feeling it safe for him to act in concert with numbers; and fearing, that if he should dare to stand alone, withholding himself from both sides, he might be considered trust-worthy by neither, and perhaps would incur some more distinct expression of their displeasure? Do we then exercise and enjoy, as we might and ought to do, that civil and religious liberty of which we are so boastful?</p><p>These are a few of many questions, which should be pressed upon the serious consideration of every one. Our limits forbid us to mention several others, which have been suggested to our minds by the return of this season. We wish to see the anniversary of our independence devoted to higher purposes, than it has usually been. There has been enough, and more than enough of self-gratulation. We have taken too much credit to ourselves for the deeds of our fathers. Let us do them and ourselves a higher honor. Let us emulate their excellences and shun their errors.—Indeed let us not be satisfied until we surpass them in knowledge and in virtue; as the superior advantages they procured for us should enable us to do. Let us make a wider and a higher application, than they did, of the great principles for which they so nobly contended. Let us not rest satisfied with our liberty, while aught of slavery abides in our land.</p>","Scholarly Notes":"Authorship unclear","Commentary":"I am suspicious that this could be Samuel J.

What is it that has animated and enabled men from time to time to become reformers, not disturbers, but true reformers; and not religious reformers alone, but moral reformers of all descriptions? Has it not been a sense of independence and personal responsibleness, and of superiority to what are usually termed existing circumstances and the spirit of the age?</p><p>A very large proportion of the evil which has always existed in society, may be traced to the want of personal independence, and disregard of personal responsibility. We do not mean by independence that fiery essence of pride and selfishness, which is quick to resent a slight or wrong; which is always ready to meet aggression more than half way; and which delights to show itself in rudeness or haughtiness, as its condition may happen to be low or high. For such independence we have little sympathy and less respect, and so far from thinking that there is a want of it in the world, can only lament that there is such a superfluity. By independence we mean another and a far different thing.—We mean the resolution which adopts, and maintains, and obeys its own standard of right and wrong; which refuses to render an unquestioning homage to the voice of the many; which, being based upon principle, is not to be driven to and fro by the popular breath, even should that breath rise into a whirlwind; which acknowledging allegiance to a higher than any mortal authority, will not forfeit it at the behest of any. This is the independence which leaves to a man his own views and convictions, his own conscience, and his own conduct. Without inciting or suffering him to be forward or boisterous, it makes him steadfast and sure. Without obliging him to feel an uncharitable scorn of public opinion, it offers a rule to his admiration and observance which is alone worthy of serious study, and entitled to his faithful submission,—the great rule of right, the solemn law of God. It teaches him to consider himself as responsible for his thoughts and actions, in the first and highest place, not to the multitude, but to his Maker; and in the second place, not to the multitude, but to his own soul. It leads him into a safer, happier, and more glorious path, than the broad, dusty, soiled and soiling road, which is beaten by the multitudinous and crowding world. It sets his feet and his heart at liberty, and breathes into his soul the consciousness of individual existence and value, and the sense of individual duty.</p><p>This is the independence, to the want of which may be traced and referred very much of past and existing evil. Not possessing it, men lose themselves, their accountability, their dignity, all that constitutes them men, in the absorbing mass; where they acquire the color, and motions, and tendencies of the mighty vortex which has engulphed them. Instead of uttering a voice of their own, they wait for an acclamation, and then they join in; instead of having opinions of their own, they listen for the prevalent opinions, and then they repeat them; instead of having a morality of their own, a religion of their own, they are content to be just as moral and just as immoral, just as religious and just as irreligious, as other people; taking the tone of the world around them, which is seldom the highest, and imbibing its sentiments, which are not always the purest. They do not test and try opinions by any self-instituted process. They do not examine manners and actions according to a fixed and exalted standard. They trouble themselves with nothing of the kind. They fall in with the great procession, without inquiring whither it is going, upwards or downwards, to a good end or a bad one; it is enough for them that they are going with it. Thus it comes that so many think evil is metamorphosed into good, when they see the multitude practise it, and good is turned into evil, when they see the multitude slight, or forsake, or forbid it. And thus it comes, that the amount of evil is so vastly increased, because there are so many who blindly and carelessly, or cowardly, without using their own eyes to observe, or their own minds to prove, follow the multitude to do it.</p><p>But must we be singular? Must we be eccentric? Must we do nothing that others do; say nothing that others say?—Must we be perpetually quarrelling with society about its usages and habits? No. We are to do none of these things. It is best that we should follow the many in all ways which are indifferent; perhaps it is best that we should follow them in some ways which are inconvenient; but we must not follow them to do evil. “Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil.” That is the simple commandment. It is very true that singularity and eccentricity, when they come from a causeless, wilful, diseased principle of opposition to general custom and sentiment, are no virtues; but even then they partake no more of the nature of sin, than does a servile acquiescence in general custom and sentiment.—Without doubt, public opinion, on most points, is worthy of respectful attention and examination; but, after you have examined it by the great and permanent light within, after you have weighed it in the balance of truth and the gospel, and found it false and wanting, reject and oppose it, and if your decision is to be called singularity and eccentricity, let it be called so, and, in the name of all that is true and holy, be singular and eccentric. We are not required to dispute with the world step by step; we are not required to be solitary and to forsake the world; we are rather called upon to do all the good we can in it, and receive all the good we can from it. But we are required to recognize a higher authority than the world’s will; to obey a more sacred commandment than the world’s law. We are required to form moral and religious principles of our own, and to regulate our commerce with the world. If we will not do this, we shall do evil; for we shall do whatever the multitude does, and the multitude often does evil. The reason why so many follow a multitude to do evil, is, that they want moral independence, and do not hold themselves individually accountable to their own spirit, or to the Father of Spirits.</p>","Scholarly Notes":"Authorship unclear","Commentary":"Authorship unclear; wonder if it is a Quaker, or someone Quaker-influenced?

It is nothing to the purpose—it is no consolation whatever to insist, that still we are superior in this respect to other communities. The only question for us to consider is—whether the people of this country have as much knowledge, as is indispensable to their temporal and eternal well-being—their social or individual happiness? Whether there is no need of earnestly reiterating every where among then the exhortation of the wise man “get wisdom, get understanding?”</p><p>I am well aware that much is <em>said</em> about the necessity of a general diffusion of knowledge to the preservation of our political constitution. But in respect to this point alone, I question if there be common among us a clear perception, and deep feeling of its importance. Else why is it that in many of our States scarcely any provision, and in some none whatever, is made for the instruction of youth; and that even in those States, which have long been applauded for the great number of their schools, a large proportion of these have ever been and still are inadequate to the purpose for which they were instituted. Though we have in New England much of the form of public education, the reality is generally wanting. Very few, in comparison with the whole number of those who attend our common schools, very few leave them possessed of those elements of good learning, which it is pretended are taught there. Very few indeed who can write their thoughts on any subject with propriety and ease; and not many more who can read the thoughts of others with facility and pleasure. Most that is really acquired at these schools, even by those who make the best use of the advantages afforded in them, is a sort of verbal acquaintance with three or four elementary sciences. They do not acquire there the use of the higher powers of mind—thinking, reasoning, judging—and our youth, excepting in the few instances of those who receive good instruction at home, go forth into the world, mingle in the collisions, and assume more or fewer of the offices of society without knowing how to distinguish between many things that differ essentially. They at once fall into the ranks of this party or that, and are content to swell the number of those, who cry out for one popular leader or another—for this system of measures or that.</p><p>Although we often hear it said, an every body concurs in the sentiment, that a federal republic cannot long&nbsp; be maintained unless the people generally are well informed, yet I ask what school, yes what single school can be named, where the great principles of civil government t are taught, and the peculiar characteristics of our Federal constitution. These, like all other great principles, are simple, and not hard to be understood, unless, the mind has been warped by a regard to sectional interests, or the schemes of a faction.—What young man of common sense might not easily be made, even before he leaves school, to understand these things perfectly? And if all young men were, as they should be, thus taught, moreover made to realize deeply their individual responsibilities as freemen, how difficult would it be to make them the creatures of a party, and to impose upon them as is continually done by factious men. But instead of this, how true it is, and sad as it is true, that most of our young men are left to learn all they are to know of political science, and of their own duties as members of a great Republic, amidst the contests of rival factions, and from those whose opinions have been warped by sectional interests and party passions.</p><p>Let it not be said, that I would impose upon the private citizen a degree of knowledge, which it can be needful only for pubic functionaries, or men of great influence in the community to possess. Let it not be objected, that I am urging the example even of a king upon every one, who hears me. Let it not be urged, that Solomon had a need of great wisdom which any of us have not; and that it is not worthwhile for all our young men to seek knowledge with as much ardor as he did, because only a few can rise to places of important trust. I say let not such sentiments be uttered, especially in this country. For is not the doctrine of hereditary right to rank utterly denounced among us? Are we not <em>all</em> born kings and princes as much as any one? Does not the supreme power emanate from ourselves? Are not <em>the people</em> the sovereign of the land?—Whom they will, they set up, and whom they will, they put down. And surely no one can foretell, which of our youth will hereafter be chosen by their fellow citizens to offices, the duties of which nothing less than the wisdom and understanding of Solomon would qualify them to discharge well.</p><p>As every man in the course of events may be called upon to serve the public, every man should qualify himself to do so in the best manner possible. But suppose that ninety out of a hundred of our youth may never be placed in office, be it remembered they are all to take a part in conferring offices; and this, though unhappily it is lightly esteemed, is a duty no less than a privilege of greatest moment. He is not fit to be a freeman, who does not hold his right of suffrage most sacred; too sacred to be prostituted to a party, not less than to the will of an individual usurper! He is not fit to have the right of suffrage, who does not hold his high prerogative in such esteem, that he will not exercise it but upon independent and rational conviction! And such a conviction cannot be formed in a mind that is unenlightened. Can any one deny that the more wisdom an individual may have, the more valuable he will be to the country, though he may never be known in public life?—If all our private citizens were as wise as Solomon, would it not be all the better for themselves and for the nation? Surely so! else are the fundamental principles of our civil constitution false!!</p>","Scholarly Notes":"Authorship unclear","Commentary":"Could be Charles C.

After quoting from our prospectus, a sentence showing our disapprobation of the dominant party in our last Legislature, he goes on with the confident air of a man who thinks he cannot be mistaken, “what is this but an acknowledged preference for, and a devotion to a political party?” How conclusive! Because we disapprove one political party, we must necessarily—not merely approve, but be <em>devoted</em> to another. Because we have expressed a hope that one party will not reign long, “it follows” that we shall endeavor to transfer the rule to another. Admirable logic!</p><p>To the Advertiser’s assertion that the paper originated in party feeling and from unworthy motives, we answer, (first asking by the way, who probably knows our motives best, we or the Advertiser,) that it matters little to what motives the establishment of the Unionist is attributable, so long as its <em>course</em> is fair, upright and consistent with its professions. If the Advertiser will pursue such a course, we will promise to say nothing about the motives which induced its change from the “bitter hostility to President Jackson and his friends” which it manifested “for nearly five years,” to a course and character diametrically opposite. We will not even hint that the <em>disinterested</em> Advertiser which resolves to “continue firm and unflinching in the pursuance of its duty, so long as it has one reader left,” was <em>bought up</em> by the Jackson party.</p><p>But it is said that we are not consistent with our professions. We will not take it upon us to say whether, in making this charge, the Advertiser man has exposed his incapacity to comprehend the plain import of language, or has shown a disposition, wilfully to pervert the truth. One of the two is evident. That we do not possess experience “in getting up independent papers,” head with professions at variance with our intended practice, or in any other species of deception, which would enable us to impose upon the public and yet escape suspicion, we freely confess; nor is it our desire at present to avail ourselves of the superior experience in such matters of any of our editorial brethren. When we engage in an enterprise which requires that kind of experience, we shall doubtless call in the assistance of such of our acquaintance as are best versed in the mystery of making promises to be “revoked.” But that we are incompetent to the easy task of telling the truth, (for we consider it easy, whatever the Advertiser may think of it,) in plain, intelligible language, we are unwilling yet to admit. We refer any candid man, to our prospectus, and the leading article of our first number, for evidence that we have spoken intelligibly; and to the whole of that sheet, and of this also, for proof that, so far as we can be judged by our acts, what we said was <em>truth</em> &amp; that we have been consistent with our professions. We ask our readers to compare with the evidence thus collected, the leading article and several other pieces in the last Advertiser, and say if that paper has not misrepresented us. We have never represented ourselves as indifferent or neutral on the questions moral or political, at present agitating the community, nor are we so. We have opinions which we shall defend to the extent of our poor ability, &amp; for their defence this paper was established. In our leading article last week, we alluded to the fact that “the majority had no organ of communication,” as one reason why some gentlemen opposed in sentiment to the Advertiser, had put in operation this press, one object of which would be, to counteract the effect of the Advertiser’s unfair course. Now does not this show clearly, that in charging us as guilty of inconsistency because we oppose the measures he advocates, the Advertiser editor brings against us a groundless accusation.</p><p>But it will perhaps be said, we are pledged to no party. And so we are. Can the Advertiser see no difference between opposing his party and supporting another? Cannot this paper be made the organ of the majority, and yet be the exclusive organ of no party? If he will lay his finger on the passage in our paper in which we advocate any party as such, or in any way depart from our expressed design of canvassing the claims of men and the propriety of measures on their own merits, then will we acknowledge our offence, and humbly ask forgiveness and promise amendment, nor will we “revoke our promise” before the week’s end, even should he tell his readers we have made it.</p><p>While we thus openly declare that we are not indifferent on the subjects which have been noticed in our paper, we still adhere to our avowal, that we shall discuss them and give our opinions upon them, without reference to the circumstances that this or that party holds sentiments similar to, or differing from ours, we shall also admit properly written communications against, as well as in favor of our views. If this will not constitute our paper as independent one, we acknowledge our ignorance of the meaning of the term.</p><p>When the Advertiser detects us departing from this course, he may then complain of us, as we have done of him, for being one sided, and may call ours a “counterfeit independent paper.” And when we perceive him pursuing a course like this, we will acknowledge his right to the praise of <em>genuine</em> independence. But till then we shall consider ourselves justified in adhering to our original assertion, that the <em>want of fairness and independence </em>in the Advertiser, led to the establishment at this time, of another paper.</p>","Scholarly Notes":null,"Commentary":null},{"pid":"obj24","identifier":"unionist--text-0024","title":"\"We cannot but admire the facility\"","bibliographicCitation":"The Unionist 1833-08-08","bibliographicCitation.republished":null,"fullIssueSequenceNumber":"1833-08-08 p02.10","creator":"Charles C.

EDITOR.—It is often said that the perpetuity of our peculiar form of government, and the preservation of our free institutions, which are in truth the chief glory of our land, depend upon the INTELLIENCE and VIRTUE of the people; this has been so often repeated and so universally assented to, that it has come to be a trite political maxim. Now suppose, or rather admit, the people of Connecticut to be an <em>intelligent people, </em>what will be one of the necessary consequences resulting from the admission? Surely that the people themselves examine the spirit and tendency of all laws which are to be enforced among them; and further that they see and know that their Representatives in the exercise of their delegated power, do not transcend the limits prescribed them by the Constitution, which is a gauge in the hand of the Constituent to be applied to acts of the delegate.</p><p>The Constitution was not made for the Executive, nor the Legislative, nor the Judicial department of the Government! For whom then was it made? The people made it, and they made it for themselves and for their posterity; it is then emphatically the people’s; and on its provisions they rely, for its support they will contend, and by its spirit and its letter shall their privileges and immunities be adjudged. It is a mighty shield, which the humblest citizen may lift up between himself and the inflictions of injury by arbitrary, assumed authority; it is a sanctuary, to which the persecuted may flee and find ample and free protection; and it is a Haven, so safe that he who <em>anchors within </em>&nbsp;it, needs no <em>insurance</em>!</p><p>Such being the Constitution, how invaluable a treasure! What should be done to preserve it? Diffuse knowledge through the land,—open the fountains of intelligence,—be as Catholic in matters of Education, as you are tolerant in religion,—be in fact, what you are in profession,—a Democracy, and let the INTELLIGENCE be, where the POWER is, in the People! Then, and not till then, will the symmetry of our inimitable form of Government shine forth in the full splendor and beauty of its exact proportions; then, and not till then, will the harsh notes of discord cease, and be succeeded by a deep and national euphony sweeping over the land, and by its magic strains charming to the standard of the Constitution, every lover of his race,—of his Country and of his God. Who that is at all competent to examine with understanding the Constitution of the U. States—to perceive its checks and balances—where power is imparted and where again, it operates with restraining force—where provisions are made for an efficient and energetic administration of the government, and in case of abuse, the <em>Cavesson</em> placed in the hands of the people—to see with a philanthropic ken, the beautiful and harmonious distributions of the functions of Government, among the various departments, and above all to perceive and realize that, with the framers of this revered instrument, the ultimate object, after all was the security and happiness o the people,—who that can do this, will not wish the Constitution of his country to remain inviolate, and be desirous that to the Constitutional test should be brought every doubtful or ambiguous enactment of State Legislatures? Although I detest all petty litigation by which the peace of community is many times disturbed, yet I most heartily rejoice when ever I see one of my fellow citizens on whom a law, novel in its provisions and doubtful in its tendency, is made to bear, pursuing “the peaceful and rightful remedy” by laying his complaint before a tribunal, constituted, among other things, to protect the citizen from all unconstitutional enactments upon his personal liberty, or his right of private property. The citizen who does this evinces a vigilance, and a respect for the great charter of our rights, commendable to himself, and worthy the emulation of others. What will be the prospect of the Republic, when such a deep and sickly apathy shall overtake our citizens, as that they can witness even with partial indifference any infractions upon the Constitution, their richest earthly treasure; and if its integrity be preserved, the best inheritance of their children, but, when crippled and polluted, their sorest calamity!</p><p>UNIONIST.</p>","Scholarly Notes":null,"Commentary":"I think this is setting up the argument of Ellsworth for the trial, asking the jury to decide on the legality of the Black Law itself"},{"pid":"obj38","identifier":"unionist--text-0038","title":"The Question","bibliographicCitation":"The Unionist 1833-08-08","bibliographicCitation.republished":null,"fullIssueSequenceNumber":"1833-08-08 p02.24","creator":"Samuel J.

The following extract from Mr. May’s letter to Andrew T. Judson, Esq. presents it in the true light.</strong></p><p>Nothing, I am confident, could have been further from Miss Crandall’s intention, than to do her neighbors any injury. And Sir, you may rest assured, the gentlemen referred to in her Advertisement would not uphold her a moment in violating any of your rights. The determination she has formed to devote herself to the education of colored females, we cannot but highly approve. Her residence in your village is altogether a providential circumstance. We should encourage her benevolent enterprise, wherever it might be undertaken. And if a suitable situation can be provided for her, in some place where her neighbors would assist and cheer her, or where they would only not molest her, we should rejoice to have her remove thither. But you declared, in the town meeting, that the school should not be located in any part of Canterbury—and also that there is not a town in the State which would admit such a seminary within its borders. It is therefore all the more necessary that she should be sustained where she now is. It is to be deeply regretted that yourself and others are opposed to her. We think you are doing yourselves no honor; and more than that, we are persuaded you are helping to perpetuate the great iniquity, and the deep disgrace of our country. The question between us is not simply whether thirty or forty colored girls shall be well educated at a school to be kept in Canterbury; but whether the people in any part of our land will recognize and generously protect the “inalienable rights of man,” without distinction of color? If this be not done, in Connecticut, where else in our land can we expect it will be done, at least in our day? That it cannot be done even in this State without a struggle, is not most shamefully obvious. A year or two since, some benevolent individuals proposed to erect an institution, at New Haven, for the education of colored young men. The design was defeated by violent opposition. If the citizens had opposed merely its location in that City, they might have escaped condemnation, for such a seminary there might have been very prejudicial to Yale College. But it was only too apparent, that their hostility to the institution was peculiarly embittered by their prejudices against the color of those, who were to be educated at it. So too in the case at Canterbury; no one pretends there would have been any opposition to Miss Crandall’s school, if her pupils were to be white. The tincture of their skin then it is which has called out the men of influence in array against her; and has even procured from the freemen of the town an expression of their “unqualified disapprobation” of her plan.</p><p>Here then, in Connecticut, we have had two recent instances of outrage committed upon “the inalienable rights of man.” Among these rights, to use the language of the Declaration of Independence “are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” Now Education has from the first, been regarded in this State highly conducive to private happiness, and the public weal. Yet have our colored brethren been twice angrily denied permission to seek this blessing, to the extent they have desired. Will the people of Connecticut generally, countenance these violation of our civil and religious principles? If they will, let them no longer claim to be a republican, much less a christian people!</p>","Scholarly Notes":null,"Commentary":null},{"pid":"obj39","identifier":"unionist--text-0039","title":"The Journal of Commerce versus Col.

We do so, because we understand it to be a sort  of official declaration of the grounds upon which the law and proceedings  under it, relative to the school for colored children in that town, are to be  defended. We are certainly willing it should have all proper weight. Yet we  must think the ground taken will be very difficult to maintain. The opposition  to the school then, is made because it is a school of immediate abolition  doctrines. This is not the ground of defence which has ever before been taken.  The Report to the Legislature and the Law, both set forth the injurious influx  of blacks from other states as the evil to be prevented. But whether new or  old, the position now assumed is one which cannot be maintained under our  institutions. We have learned, and our constitutions are based upon the  knowledge, that the best way to put down error is by argument, not by law.  That the best way to maintain truth and sound opinions is to leave error  unrestrained. Admitting therefore, that the doctrines of the abolitionists are  never so erroneous, it amounts to nothing in defence of the law; for error,  whether religious, political, scientific, or of whatever sort, is entitled, so  far as the laws are concerned, to set up schools and colleges, and propagate  itself by all peaceable means, as entirely unrestrained as if it were pure  truth. Surely in Connecticut, that focus of toleration, the doctrines of this  defence will find no countenance. As to the improprieties in the manner of  introducing the school, and the abusive anonymous letters which were sent to  the gentlemen, they are certainly not matters which full grown men should set  forth in so formidable a manner. Indeed we think that such a defence as this,  must be with sensible men, their last effort before abandoning the cause.</p>","Scholarly Notes":null,"Commentary":null},{"pid":"obj40","identifier":"unionist--text-0040","title":"FROM THE HARTFORD TIMES!!","bibliographicCitation":"The Unionist 1833-08-08","bibliographicCitation.republished":"The Hartford Times (not researched)","fullIssueSequenceNumber":"1833-08-08 p02.26","creator":"Journal of Commercel; Charles C.

July 19, 1833</p><p align=\"center\">CIRCULAR OF MESSRS ADAMS AND JUDSON.</p><p align=\"right\">CANTERBURY, CT. July 19, 1833</p><p>  It may be due the public, as well as ourselves, and the town in which we  reside, that a concise answer should be made to some of the most prominent  aspersions cast upon us, and our fellow citizens, in connection with the  subject of a school set up in Canterbury for “colored misses.” We had supposed  that the principal facts were understood by the community, so that any  exaggerated statements, false accusations, or artful insinuations, would find  no resting place in the mind of any honest man. Lest it may be supposed that  we acquiesce in these numerous and perverted statements, we think proper to  present for consideration, a few circumstances, trusting that those who know  us, will not so readily receive for truth, the assumptions of those who have  so liberally bestowed so great a variety of epithets upon us.</p><p>  PRUDENCE CRANDALL came here with a proposition to remove her School from  Plainfield to this place, and establish one here, for the instruction of Young  Ladies. The citizens of Canterbury readily embraced the offer, and gave her  their patronage. The School, continued from the Fall of 1831, until January or  February, 1833. At that time, as we have since learned, Miss C. was proselyted  to the  <em>immediate Abolition</em>  faith. She started for Boston under a fictitious pretence, and saw  <em>Mr. Garrison,</em>  the leader of that party. She returned home and immediately went to New York  and came back, as she told us, with an engagement and under a contract, to  receive into her school, twenty colored girls, with an expectation of  increasing the number to the full extent of her accommodations. The dismission  of her former school, and the announcement of this new project, was the first  knowledge given to those who had patronized her. It was soon ascertained upon  what ground the school was to be established, and what principles were to be  inculcated. The levelling principles of the immediate abolitionists, had taken  full possession of her mind, and it was soon made known to us,  <em>who</em>  were to be the patrons of the school. When we saw Arnold Buffum, and others  associated with him, assert what they denominated her rights, and when their  threats were poured out upon the town, and all its inhabitants, we could  anticipate the ultimate effects upon the town.</p><p>  We distinctly state to all who may feel an interest in this matter, that we  are not opposed to the education and kind treatment of the colored people. It  is not in the power of any man, in truth, to say, that we have ever  ill-treated a person of color. We desire to see them free and happy. This is  the universal sentiment of the inhabitants of the town, so far as we know it.  Our schools admit colored children to equal privileges, and we rejoice that  they do so. Those schools are all visited and are under the superintendence of  proper boards, excluding all danger, from the inculcation of erroneous  principles. The law now in force, makes schools for foreign blacks subject to  the assent of the civil authority and select men of each town, so that it is  an easy matter to have such a school now, provided that board could be  satisfied that no pernicious principles are to be inculcated, and no danger  could arise to the town or state. Is not this right? Why should any person  desire to force upon any community, a school of any sort, against all their  wishes? Have the inhabitants no right to be heard in reference to the location  of such an institution among them, and more especially when they know the  dangerous consequences to which such measures would tend? Are the people of  this State ready to admit that the abolitionists, as they are called, are  diffusing sentiments and opinions consistent with the constitution and the  peace of society? Is there any individual in the State of Connecticut, who  would feel willing to have such a school. Together with all the necessary  evils, situated within his own town or village? The answer, will be, no. Then  let the same feeling be extended to us. This is the only way to ascertain  whether the town of Canterbury has done right or wrong. The distinct objection  which has been made by the inhabitants of the town, to the location o this  school within its limits, consists in the dangerous tendency of the principles  pressed by the abolitionists wherever they go, in language peculiar to  themselves.—These principles are well understood, and it would be with deep  regret, that any school should be established and continued, for their  advancement, in a community where our friends are compelled to reside.*</p><p>  The manner in which Miss C. effected the change in her school, was very  objectionable, and no friend that we have met with, can furnish any  justification. We know of nothing that could have been done by the town, that  has not been done, to induce her to remove the school, to some place where  there were no objections. She has been urged by individuals—and entreated by  committees, who have waited upon her, to give up this location of her school.  We have heretofore stated, and we now repeat it that we offered to take the  house at the price she had contracted to pay for it, and relieve her from any  loss on that account. This was declined, and then the town petitioned the  General Assembly, and the law which she, with the advice of her friends, now  resists, was passed. Nearly a month after the rising of the Legislature, she  was notified that a suit would be commenced by the Grand Juror. At the trial,  her counsel gave in a demurrer to the complaint, admitting the facts true, and  submitted to the finding of the court without argument. The Court required her  to give bonds of $150 to appear at the net Court, which she refused to  give.—This she had a right to do, and be committed if she chose. No one will  say that she could not have given the bond on the spot. But it had been agreed  before hand, by those who directed her what to do, that she should go to jail.  She went and staid as long as suited her purposes, less than 24 hours, and  then gave the bond. Some person has put in wide circulation, the story that  she was confined in the cell of Watkins the murderer. This is part of the same  contrivance to “get up more excitement!” She never was confined in the  “murderer’s cell.” She was lodged in the debtor’s room, where every  accommodation was provided, both for her and  <em>her friends,</em>  whose visits were constant. She was confined no where else. It is said in  justification of this untruth, that Watkins, some of the last days of his  life, was taken out of his cell to receive the clergy and his friends, in the  debtor’s room, because it was more convenient. How does that accord with the  statement made? Just as well might it be said by those who go into the  meeting-house, where Watkins attended meeting some of his last Sabbaths, that  <em>they</em>  had been in the “murderers cell.”</p><p>  Does any one think or believe that this school, with all its evils, should be  fixed, and permanently located here, we will just ask them to consider the  manner too, in which this has been pressed upon us, by foreigners or persons  residing out of town and State. If they are actuated by the pure principles of  benevolence, how much more of that virtue they would evince to the world, by  taking the school home to the places of their own residence. What necessity is  there to bring persons from New York, or Philadelphia, to Canterbury? They  certainly can be educated there quite as well, and more especially if we are  so much like barbarians as is pretended. We wish this to be well considered,  before blame is cast upon the town of Canterbury. Is not the peace and safety  of community, of consequence? It will not be understood that the town ever  entertained any danger from the girls themselves, but every person must know  that many others will of necessity, be drawn around this nucleus, and  connected with the principles of the abolitionists, who will not say that our  habitations, our persons and our peace, will be insecure? In answer to this  question, we will exhibit to the public, some of the principles,—some of this  christian benevolence,—some of this milk of human kindness, extended to us.  During the last week, the  <em>“Climax”</em>  has been circulated, and sent us from the Post office in New York, marked with  double postage, when the gentleman from whose press it issued, might as well  have brought it himself to us, as to others. We unequivocally say, the  ”Climax” is a wanton perversion of truth.</p><p>  We will invite the reader to go one step further. We have received through the  Post Office, from some zealous abolitionist, a tract, upon which is  ingeniously written, in connection with the title of the tract, so that when  taken together it reads as follows—viz:</p><p>“Thus saith the Lord, consider your way.</p><p>The Eternal Misery of Hell: this place is for whom?</p><p>For Judge Adams and A.T. Judson.”</p><p>  If the reader will not be wearied, one other specimen of this benevolent work,  which is going on to coerce this State into these Christian measures, as they  are denominated, shall also be exhibited to public view. On the 18  <sup>th</sup>  inst., one of the signers of this communication had delivered to him by the  Post Master, a letter mailing in Pittsburg, Penn. July 12, in the following  language:</p><p align=\"right\">‘Pittsburg July 10, 1833.</p><p>  “Disgraceful Scoundrel—I have just read in the Boston Advocate, that you have  had a white young lady put in prison, for taking in her school some colored  girls. From all that I have seen and heard of your conduct in this matter, I  must say my opinion of you is this—You is (are) a poor, dirty, mean, pitiful,  dastardly puppy. Hypocritical villain, a rascal of the lowest order. I cannot  or will not waste any more paper with such a Hell deserving hypocrite as you  is. (are.) But this much I will tell you, I will be in Canterbury in 3 weeks,  and you may prepare yourself for me, for I mean to beat you under the earth,  if I can lay my hands on you. If not I will take a shot at you. You poor dead  dog.”</p><p>  “N.B. If you don't change your course of life and conduct towards that good  young woman, in case I do not meet with you myself, I will hire some Irishman  to mould you. It  <em>shall</em>  be done if I have to [pay] five hundred dollars to have it done.”</p><p>  “I leave you a poor Devil. G.P.”</p><p>  “The name of the young lady is Miss Prudence Crandall. At the advice of a  friend, [I] erase my name, as I shall be in your little Hell.”</p><p>  Fellow citizens, such is the temper, and such the means employed, to fasten  upon this town, and its inhabitants, an institution of  <em>benevolence.</em>  When it shall be fastened here, what will be the effect? We leave them to the  sober judgment of reflecting men.</p><p>RUFUS ADAMS.</p><p>ANDREW T. JUDSON.</p><p>  *The charge implied in this sentence, is a FALSE ACCUSATION.

JUDSON, ESQ.</p><p>  Gentlemen: I presume that the foregoing communication contains a statement of  the case, between yourselves &amp; Miss Crandall, as favorable to yourselves,  as you were able to make. The request to all the Editors of newspapers in the  state, that they would republish the article is proof sufficient of the  estimation in which it is held. Still, gentlemen, it appears to me to be any  thing but an exculpation of yourselves. This I shall now attempt to show.</p><p>  You evidently intend it should be believed, that Miss Crandall gave the  citizens of Canterbury just cause of offence, at first, in having so soon  discontinued the instruction of their daughters. The charge has indeed been  explicitly brought against her in another periodical (“the Colonizationist No.  2”) in a letter from Canterbury, written very probably by one or the other of  yourselves. It is there stated, that she “made numerous and solemn engagements  with the citizens of Canterbury, that if they would aid her in the  establishment of a school, she would continue the school for their children.  “These engagements” says the letter-writer “she has violated without excuse.”  If you could prove all this, Gentlemen, you would certainly prove that  <em>she</em>  did very wrong, but not that  <em>you</em>  have done right.” I will venture to say however, that if she had given up the  office&nbsp; of an instructress altogether, we never should have heard a  syllable about her “numerous, solemn engagements.” And discontinued the  instruction of your children, if she had not first been threatened with the  loss of your patronage, unless she dismissed from her school a colored girl,  whom she thought it her duty to educate.† Now, gentlemen, if it be true, as  you assert, that you and your neighbors are not opposed to the education and  kind treatment of colored people, if you really desire to see them free and  happy, why was Miss C. threatened with loss of patronage if she permitted  Sarah Harris to continue as one of her pupils? You tell your readers that the  common schools in your town admit colored children to equal privileges with  white ones, and that you rejoice that they do so. Why then did you not rejoice  that Miss Crandall admitted a colored girl into her school? Why! unless you  chose that the children of colored people should enjoy the blessings of  education, only in a very stinted measure? Answer me this if you please?</p><p>  Again. You complain, and have elsewhere complained that Miss C. made the  change in her school abruptly—that she did it without asking the consent or  even the advice of her former patrons.&nbsp; I apprehend that the blame for  this must attach to yourselves rather than to her. If you had ever evinced,  that interest in the education and freedom and happiness of our colored  brethren, which you now profess to feel, there can be little doubt that she  would have disclosed to you her feelings and her purposes; and gladly have  availed herself of your assistance. But she perceived that you, like most of  our white brethren, regarded the colored children of our Heavenly Father as  doomed to degradation, and not to be admitted to equal privileges even in this  land of boasted liberty. Therefore she did not reveal her plan until it was  matured. She anticipated that you would oppose it. The event has proved that  she judged correctly.</p><p>  But you assure your fellow-citizens, and have made the declaration before,  that the main ground of your opposition to the school, has been and is that  you know certain erroneous principles were to be inculcated there. What those  principles are, you have not stated. You  <em>assert</em>  that they are very dangerous—thinking perhaps that you may thus frighten the  community into the belief that your persecution of Miss Crandall has been  altogether reasonable, and praiseworthy. Have not the enemies of truth, and  freedom, and the Gospel in all ages pursued a similar course? Let us see how  you have proceeded.</p><p>  Miss Crandall advertised in several newspapers, that she would receive into  her family “young ladies and little misses of color” and give them instruction  in certain branches of knowledge, which she specified. You and others in the  village were offended at her proposal. And I venture to say that no one of you  will deny that the real ground of your offence was, that her pupils were to be  colored girls. If her proposals had been to receive into her family “young  ladies and little misses” from New-York and Boston and other cities, whose  parents would be able and willing to pay more liberally for their education,  than we in the country are accustomed to pay for ours. I suppose not one of  her neighbors would have dreamt of denying her the right to do so. It was then  without doubt the color of her pupils, that was the whole ground of the  objection made at first to her school. Instead however of frankly  acknowledging this—acknowledging that you are unbelievers (practically at  least) of the great truth that all men are created equal, and have an  unalienable right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness—instead I say  of frankly acknowledging your unbelief or your dislike of this truth, as the  ground of your opposition, you have gone about (like the opposers of human  improvement in all ages) to make it generally believed that the school was  established for purposes very different from those avowed in the  advertisement. You have tried to awaken the apprehension that the existence of  such a school will be directly or indirectly most dangerous to the peace, and  welfare of the country. And you now set this forth as your principal objection  to the school.</p><p>  How should you, gentlemen, like to be dealt with in this mode? How would Col.  Judson like to find his neighbors opposing his location in their village, on  the presumption, that he had set up his office there, for other purposes than  those of his profession—on the presumption that he came there to disseminate  certain pernicious doctrines in politics or religion? How would be like it, if  he found the people of Canterbury combined to make him discontinue his  practice as a lawyer, or leave the town, because he is known to be a  freemason. If his neighbors should succeed in diffusing unfriendly feelings  towards him throughout the town, and at length procured a general meeting of  the inhabitants to express their unqualified disapprobation of his purpose to  continue as a lawyer among them, what would he think, what would he say, if  after having heard himself accused of holding and intending to disseminate  pernicious principles, his fellow citizens should refuse his permission to be  heard in explanation and defence of his real views and purposes? Would he not  cry out against the unrighteousness? Gentlemen, you must reverse the case, if  you would see how your conduct appears to many, and will appear to many more.</p><p>  That some of Col. Judson’s principles are actually bad, dangerous to the peace  of Society &amp;c. has now become most notorious. For has he not been laboring  from the first to prevent the dissemination of what he believes to be  erroneous and dangerous opinions, not by  <em>showing</em>  them to be erroneous, but by exciting the popular prejudices, and calling for  the interference of the civil arm? And is there any principle, which has  wrought more mischief in the world that this? All history answers, No.</p><p>  In this connexion, I will notice a false accusation which you have again  brought against me. You accuse Mr Buffum and myself of pouring out threats  upon the town and inhabitants. The same charge you alleged more explicitly  against us in the Norwich Republican of March 27  <sup>th</sup>  . But you have never informed the public what those threats were.—Nor can you.  None were uttered. I now declare, that I heard not a word from Mr Buffum in  the tone or spirit of threat; and that not a syllable of the kind escaped my  lips. I call upon you to contradict me if you please—and make your  contradiction good if you can.</p><p>  You have taken no little pains, gentlemen, in your communication, &amp; on  other occasions, to make it appear as if you and the people of Canterbury are  the injured, suffering party. That you may have suffered some injury in the  course of the unhappy collision, which you have awakened, is possibly true.  But that any injury, any disregard to your rights and feelings was intended in  the establishment of Miss Crandall’s school on its present plan, there is not  the slightest reason to suppose. I can most solemnly declare, that from the  first I have been willing to treat even your prejudices with some  consideration. Witness my letter to Miss Crandall, dated Feb. 28  <sup>th</sup>  , written so soon as I heard of the opposition you were preparing to make to  the prosecution of her plan. If I had been permitted to speak for her at your  town meeting, as  <em>she</em>  requested I might be permitted to do, you would soon have learnt that neither  Miss C. nor her patrons had any wish to force the continuance of her school in  your village. They were, and I trust still are, willing to have it removed to  any  <em>suitable</em>  place, that might be obtained for it. In a conversation with Col. Judson a few  days after the meeting, I gave him this assurance distinctly; as he doubtless  remembers. His reply I shall never forget. ‘No,’ said he, ‘that school shall  not be located in any part of the town of Canterbury; no—not in part of the  State of Connecticut. I will get a law passed,’ he continue, ‘by our next  Legislature, prohibiting the introduction of colored from other States into  this for the purpose of attending school.‡ I can obtain thirty thousand  signers to a petition for such a Law.’ The same overbearing, tyrannical spirit  was conspicuous in that gentleman’s language and manner, at the town meeting;  and has been too apparent in many of his doings since. To protect, if I may be  able a lone woman from the operations of such a spirit, I have felt it my duty  to stand with others between her and her oppressors. If she has done wrong, or  spoken unadvisedly, let her be rebuked. I would not attempt to justify her  error. But she has rights, and they must be respected. If her location in your  village is disagreeable to you, and you can enable her to procure suitable  accommodations elsewhere, I for one should advise her to remove, &amp; I  believe all her patrons would concur in the advice. But your attempt to compel  her to abandon her school, we regard as a flagrant violation of her privileges  as an American citizen, and we have therefore advised her to resist, peaceably  but firmly. The law which you have procured from our last Legislature, we are  confident is unconstitutional, and have been so advised by able civilians.—We  have therefore thought it best for Miss C. to continue her school, until the  validity of that Law shall have been ascertained. If it shall be found to be  indeed a good and a valid law of Connecticut, then of course Miss Crandall and  her patrons will peaceably abide the consequences of her violation of it. Her  school must be abandoned; and it must then be acknowledged before the world  “that all men are not permitted to enjoy their unalienable rights even in  New-England.\"</p><p>  I have more to say in reply to your communication; and shall resume my remarks  next week; when I shall particularly notice the charge so often repeated by  you, that false and dangerous principles are to be taught at Miss C’s school.</p><p>SAMUEL J. MAY</p><p>  *To preclude the possibility of an inference that the truth of this accusation  is admitted, we would simply express our conviction that Miss C. has made no  engagements, of which the discontinuance, or the change of her school could be  considered a violation. She went to Canterbury, at least as much to confer a  favor as to receive one, and was never under any more obligation to teach the  children of that village, than are the merchants there to sell their goods to  her or others, nor did she suppose the people of Canterbury to be obligated to  send their daughters to her school, more than they were, on than she was, to  purchase the commodities offered by those merchants.</p><p>  † See Miss Crandall’s Letter published in the Advertiser of May 9  <sup>th</sup>  .</p><p>  ‡ Col. Judson in the earnestness of his determination to overthrow Miss  Crandall’s school, threatened that there should also be a clause in his Law,  by which the colored people in the State should be restrained within the towns  to which they now belong, so that even their children could not be sent to  Miss C. for instruction. But it seems that for some wide reason he has since  concluded to omit the proposed clause.</p>","Scholarly Notes":null,"Commentary":null},{"pid":"obj43","identifier":"unionist--text-0043","title":"Public Sentiment, Respecting the Black Law of Connecticut and the persecution of Miss Crandall","bibliographicCitation":"The Unionist 1833-08-08","bibliographicCitation.republished":null,"fullIssueSequenceNumber":"1833-08-08 p03.29","creator":"Charles C.

JUDSON’S CIRCULAR— We have seen a Circular written by Andrew T. Judson,  Canterbury, in vindication of his conduct towards Miss Crandall, and in favor  of the new law, under which she was imprisoned. It is a very lame affair: much  more so than we should have expected from a lawyer, aspiring to a seat in  Congress. He does not even make a  <em>plausible</em>  defence. The very  <em>plea</em>  must insure  <em>condemnation</em>  among republicans. Miss Crandall’s school, according to Mr. Judson, is to be  legislated down—  <em>not</em>  because colored people are not human beings—“created free and equal”—not  because they are not entitled to education—  <em>not</em>  because the object is undesirable—  <em>not</em>  because Miss Crandall was incompetent to teach them—  <em>not</em>  because the town was in danger (as had been pretended) of being overrun with  paupers, but because Miss Crandall is an  <em>abolitionist!</em>  A fine TEST ACT, truly! Why not because she is a Baptist? A large portion of  the Baptists, and of other sects, we trust, are rapidly embracing the heresy  against which “His Grace, the” [American] “Lord Bishop of Canterbury” has  fulminated his papal bull. And so the abolitionists are legally disqualified  from school teaching, are they? From what will they next be debarred? From  preaching? From medical and from legal practice? From buying and selling? as  rumor even now reports of Canterbury, and as the Revelator of Patmos has  predicted, of the latter days?”&nbsp; (Rev.xiii.17.)</p><p>  Mr. Judson pleads in favor of Canterbury legislation, that the people of  <em>other</em>  towns, would be as unwilling as those of Canterbury, to see a similar school  established, and then to strengthen this, by  <em>another</em>  plea, he complains because Miss Crandall did not accept his offer to remove  her  <em>location!</em>  This savors of the Irish, as well as of the Romish bull! Much in the same vein  of logic, Mr. Judson defends the  <em>Connecticut</em>  law, by remarking that schools might be established in  <em>other</em>  states! Above all, the  <em>present</em>  law of Connecticut,  <em>against</em>  the free and unrestrained education of the colored people, Mr. Judson argues,  <em>cannot</em>  be  <em>bad,</em>  BECAUSE a  <em>former</em>  law of that state, (as yet unrepealed—a law,—he  <em>might</em>  have said—enacted when  <em>all</em>  the people of Connecticut were “abolitionists,” and ere the cunning device of  Colonziationism was dreamed of)—is a  <em>good</em>  one and contains  <em>contrary</em>  characteristics!”</p><p align=\"center\">“A Daniel! still I say, a second Daniel!”</p><p>  Mr. Judson must certainly be sent to Congress! –  <em>Genius of Temperance</em></p>","Scholarly Notes":null,"Commentary":"The anti-Catholic sentiment that was always bubbling beneath the surface of the Reform movements rears its head in the open for a moment here."},{"pid":"obj54","identifier":"unionist--text-0054","title":"Juvenile Intrepedity","bibliographicCitation":"The Unionist 1833-08-08","bibliographicCitation.republished":"<em>N.Y.

It left one sixth part of the  population the victims of a servitude immeasurably more debasing, than that  from which it delivered the rest. While this nation held up its declaration of  independence—its noble bill of human rights, before an admiring world, in one  hand; it mortified the friends of humanity, by oppressing the poor and  defenceless with the other. The progress of time has not lessened the evil.  There are now held in involuntary and perpetual slavery, in the southern half  of this republic, more than 2,000,000 of men, women, and children, guarded  with a vigilance, which strives, and with success appalling as it is complete,  to shut out every ray of knowledge, human and divine, and reduce them as  nearly as possible to a level with the brutes. These miserable slaves are not  only compelled to labor without choice and without hire, but they are  subjected to the cruelty and lust of their masters to an unbounded extent. I  the northern states there is very generally a sympathy with the slave-holders,  and a prejudice against the slaves, which shows itself in palliating the crime  of slave-holding, and in most unrighteously disregarding the rights, and  vilifying the characters of the free colored men.</p><p>  At the same time, slavery, as a system, is (in a certain sense) condemned. It  is confessed to be a great evil, “a moral evil,” and, when the point is urged,  <em>a sin.</em>  The slaves, it is admitted, have rights—every principle of honesty, justice,  and humanity,  <em>“in the abstract,”</em>  calls aloud that they should be made free. The word of God is in their favour.  Indeed, there is no ground claimed by the abettors of slavery, on which they  pretend to justify it for a moment, but a supposed—a begged—  <em>expediency,</em>  baseless as the driven clouds. I say baseless, for while not a single fact has  ever been produced, going to show the danger of putting the slaves, all at  once, under the protection of law, and employing them as free laborers, there  have been produced, on the other side, varied and fair experiments showing,  that it is altogether safe and profitable.</p><p>  In this state of things where had the American church stood? Has she too  sympathized with the hearts of the Pharaohs? Or has she in the spirit of the  martyrs of former times, borne an unflinching testimony against this sin?  Alas! The painful truth stares us in the face. She has come down from the high  and firm foundation of scripture truth, and is professedly at work upon a  floating  <em>expediency,</em>  doing against slavery what cab be done upon the checked current of popular  prejudice.—Speaking through the organ of the Colonization Society, she has  admitted all that the most determined slave-holder could ask, and she is doing  just that, and no more, which so far as he understands the subject, he hails  with pleasure as a safeguard to is property in human bodies and  <em>souls.</em>  This is the testimony of slave-holders themselves—most competent witnesses.</p><p>  Is further evidence needed? When the American Colonization Society, as a  remedy for slavery, has been called in question, as well it might be for its  tardiness, if for no other reason, there has been manifested a determination  to hush inquiry. There has been a most pusillanimous shivering and shrinking  from the probe. Nay, the few men who, in the uncompromising spirit of  Christian benevolence, have urged this inquiry, have been slandered as  disturbers of the public peace,—have been assailed with abusive epithets, not  be slave-holders only, but by their brethren in the bosom of the church.</p><p>  A most singular spectacle is presented in this enlightened and Christian age;  a handful of philanthropists, dare denounce a system of legalized oppression,  and to charge guilt upon all who uphold it; upon this, not only do the  principals in crime, as might be expected, ascribe the whole to sheer malice,  but the leaders of the Christian church, as ought not to be expected, endorse,  and give currency to the charge, and throw the whole weight of their cold and  crushing influence to smother in its cradle this attempt at a gospel  reformation.</p><p>  What does all this mean? Are Christians in these northern states interested in  upholding slavery? Are they unwilling to be convinced that their colored  brethren are better than the slanders of their oppressors would make them? Are  they sure, beyond a doubt, that the colonization scheme will relieve our  country of the might evil which is crushing it? that it is the  <em>Christian</em>  way to relieve it? Are they on good evidence convinced that it is not  <em>expedient</em>  to say to the wicked, “O wicked man, thou shalt surely die?” Must they have  PEACE at any rate—peace, though the groans of millions should ascend and  mingle with the muttering thunders of coming wrath? Will they have it, that if  a word is said against a mere experiment to test the practicability of  rescuing the victim by flattering the oppressor, the whole cause of Christian  benevolence is attacked? If not, why not welcome inquiry? A thorough  investigation—a looking on  <em>both sides,</em>  would surely do no harm. Those defenders of truth who have shunned such  inquiry, have always proved themselves short-sighted. The cause of God courts  scrutiny—its advocates are thrown into no unseemly agitation when they are  most rigorously sifted.</p><p>  The subject cries aloud for more earnest consideration than it has yet  received. More than two millions of outraged, downtrodden men cry out, shall  we die in this sore bondage that white Christians may have the pleasure of  attempting to shun God’s wrath without repenting of sin?—Half a million of  free colored men cry out—America is our country—the land for which  <em>our</em>  fathers bled as well as yours. Why will you seek to banish us? The wrongs of  the poor Indian cry aloud, There is no safety in league with transgressors!  The present political aspect of the South [cries out, that tyrants do not  regard law! Six hundred millions of idolaters cry out to the American church,  “Why pluckest thou the mote out of thy brother’s eye, and behold a beam is in  thine own!”</p>","Scholarly Notes":null,"Commentary":"It is meaningful that this important work was in the hands of the students at the Canterbury Female Academy.

Their  fair images of human perfection, must chaunt their joys to “babbling  brooks”—must sigh out their griefs to an accompaniment of aquatic melody, and  “mingle their tears with the torrents as they fall.”</p><p>  Nor do rivers appear by any means contemptible in the pages of the historian.

Of the  sacred Ganges, whose waters cleanse from moral pollution? Of the yellow Tiber,  that laves the walls of the Eternal City? Of the Rubicon, where the aspiring  Roman decided between his ambition and the better feelings of his heart, and  threw the torch of civil war among the combustible materials of the old  world’s proudest empire?</p><p>  The traveler who visits lands renowned in ancient story, finds nothing in the  relics of their former grandeur, better fitted to impress the mind with that  sensation of pleasing sadness which memorials of other days call up, than the  broad streams, {unreadable due to a fold} reflected tower, palace, and temple,  glittering in the sunbeams, and whose shores echoed to the ceaseless hum of a  crowded city’s busy population, where now, solitude, desolation, and silence,  reign amid the fallen arches, the broken columns, and the mouldering ruins of  structures which the vain architect of former days reared in ponderous and  massy strength, as if defying the destroyer Time. How forcibly is he impressed  with the vanity of human greatness, as he surveys the quiet stream, rolling on  its channel, heedless of the desolation around, unchanged by the mighty  revolutions that have swept from the face of day, cities, states, and  empires—regardless alike of chieftains, kinds, and conquerors, who once dyed  its waves with the purple tide of slaughter, or received on its banks the  homage of conquered millions, and of the slaves who basely bowed the knee in  servile adoration, to the mortal god. The noble Tigris still holds its onward  course, unaltered since the haughty walls of Nineveh overhung its banks, and  her six score thousand inhabitants who knew not the right hand from the left,  listened to the prophet of the Lord warning them of speedy destruction. The  famed Euphrates ceases not to flow, though the “queen of cities” is a desert  waste, and long ages have elapsed since Chaldea heard the voice of wailing and  the loud lament, “Babylon is fallen, is fallen.” Xanthus and Scamander still  water the plains of Asia Minor, though the towers of Priam have crumbled into  dust, and the bright glory of Ilium has vanished like a vision of the night.</p><p>  And when the grave in its silence and its gloom shall have closed over all of  life and activity the earth now contains; when the grand and beautiful works  of art which we behold, shall be as the magnificence of Babylon or of Troy;  when we shall have taken up our abode in the cold chambers of darkness, “and  the places that now know us shall know us no more;” when our names shall fall  on the listener’s ear like the faint echo of a distant voice, or the dim  recollections of a half forgotten dream; when the finger of decay shall have  erased the records of our achievements, and our deeds shall be remembered as  the traditionary legends of antiquity; when the generations that succeed us  shall have faded from the earth like the passing shadow of a thin and fleecy  cloud; the lovely streams by which we delight to rove, will still wind through  the vallies [sic], diffusing verdure and fertility in their path; the cataract  will still leap “in thunder and in foam,” from the rocky brow of the  precipice, sending up its sparkling spray to glitter in the dazzling  sun-light, and to crown its front with a halo of varying and respondent hues;  the calm and stately current of the might river will still sweep on in majesty  to the ocean, shaded perhaps by the thick boughs of the giant oak or gloomy  pine, and fringed with shrubs and blooming wild flowers, where  <em>we</em>  behold reflected in its pellucid mirror, the spire of the village church, and  the thickly crowded habitations of men; and where now it visits but the forest  haunts of roving savages and beasts of prey, or glides through glens untrod by  human footsteps, and undisturbed by voice or sound, save the ripple of the  waters below &amp; the rustle of leaf and branch above, shall then be seen the  snow-white sail wafting along its tranquil tide the rich product of  agricultural industry and commercial enterprise.</p><p>  A new race shall have risen to possess the heritage of their fathers, to walk  among the ruins of our splendid edifices, to gaze on the streams that we  admire, and while they gaze, to muse as we do now, and as hundreds before us  have done, on the fleeting evanescence of earthly fame, and the shadowy  illusiveness of human grandeur.</p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “So passes  this world’s glory.”</p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <em>We, the People.</em></p>","Scholarly Notes":null,"Commentary":"This newspaper, <em>We, the People</em> is one Charles C.

She entered a demurrer to the complaint, the Court  judged the complaint sufficient and thereupon ordered Miss Crandall to give  bond with surety in the sum of $150, for her appearance before the next County  Court to be tried on said complaint, and abide the judgment of said Court  thereon. Failing to procure bonds, she was committed to prison. The cause came  on for trial before the County Court on Friday, August 23d: C.F. Cleaveland,  Esq. the Attorney for the State, being absent from indisposition, the Court  appointed Jonathan A. Welch, Esq. special attorney to conduct the prosecution.  A.T. Judson and I. Bulkley, Esqrs. were associate counsel.&nbsp; Hon. Calvin  Goddard, Hon. W. W. Ellsworth and Henry Strong, Esq. appeared for the defence.  The jury being empannelled and sworn, the counsel for the defence objected to  one of the jurors from Canterbury on the ground that he had signed petitions,  &amp;c. in respect to Miss Crandall’s school, and taken active measures to put  it down. The Court sustained the objection, and the juror was excused. They  also objected to another of the jurors on the ground that he was a member of  the Legislature which passed the law, was one of those who voted for it, and  had, of course, formed an opinion with respect to its constitutionality. The  Court decided that the juror was competent to sit. (He got excused, however,  on account of sickness.) The information against Miss Crandall consisted of  two counts. The first charged “that the said Prudence Crandall, on the 24  <sup>th</sup>  day of June last, with force, and arms, in a certain school which before that  time had been and then was set up in said Canterbury, for the instruction and  teaching of colored persons, to wit: Theodosia De Grasse, Ann Peterson, Amelia  Elizabeth Wilder, Ann Eliza Hammond, and others whose names are unknown, who  at the time so taught and instructed were not inhabitants of any town in this  state, which said acts were done, by the said Prudence Crandall, without the  consent, in writing, first had and obtained of a majority of the civil  authority and select men of the said town of Canterbury, within which said  school was then instructed, against the peace of this state, and contrary to  the form and effect of the statute in such case made and provided.”</p><p>  The second count charged “that the defendant, with force and arms did wilfully  and knowingly harbor and board, and aid and assist in harboring and boarding  certain colored persons (named above,) who, when so harbored and boarded, were  not inhabitants of any town in this State—without the consent in writing of  the civil authority and select men, &amp;c.”</p><p>Plea, Not Guilty.</p><p>The following witnesses were then called on the part of the prosecution.</p><p>  <em>Asahel Bacon</em>  said that he had called at Miss Crandall’s house in the month of June last,  having heard that she had taken some scholars from abroad. Capt. Sanger  accompanied him. They were both select men of the town. Miss Crandall invited  them into her house very politely. They asked her in relation to her scholars.  She said she had four who were from New York and one from Hartford.—She called  them in and introduced them. Theodosia De Grass, Amelia Elizabeth Wildes, and  Catherine Ann Weldon, he thinkers were the names of those called. Witness did  not remember the day of the month that he called—thinks it was the day after  the girls came—certainly soon after.</p><p>  <em>Ebenezer Sanger</em>  coincided in the statement of Mr. Bacon.</p><p>  <em>George Cady</em>  had conversed with Miss Crandall—went to her house on Friday last to summon as  witnesses to support this prosecution, some of the girls who were attending  the school. One of those named in this subpoena said that she had been sent  for him, on account of the sickness of her mother, and wished him to excuse  her attendance at Court—told her that he could not, but would state the  circumstances to the public prosecutor. Miss Crandall said that she did not  see that there was any need of witnesses at all, for she should confess that  she had broken the law.</p><p>  <em>Ann Peterson,</em>  This witness was a colored girl, said to be a pupil of Miss Crandall, and was  one of those named in the information to whom Miss C. had given instruction.  Mr. Ellsworth objected to the examination of the witness on the ground that  she could not testify without implicating herself. Mr. Welch read the clause  of the statute under which this prosecution was sustained, in which it was  enacted that the pupils in a school kept contrary to the act, might be  compelled to testify. Mr. Ellsworth said that he denied, altogether, the  competency of the Legislature to compel a witness to testify, or answer  questions that might implicate him, even to render himself liable in  debt—otherwise a witness might be compelled to testify to what would charge  him with the crime of murder. He alluded to the State Constitution and Bill or  Rights which he claimed protected every person from criminating himself by  being compelled to give testimony. It was contrary to fundamental principles.  In this case the witness might make herself an aider and abettor, and subject  herself to the penalties imposed by the statute. Mr. Judson claimed that the  witness would not by her testimony implicate herself. The law was penal, and  must be construed strictly. Even if she was aware that she was instructed by  Miss Crandall, it would not charge herself with any crime. Mr. Judson read at  length from Starkie on evidence, to show that the witness ought, on common law  principles, to be examined, and was bound to answer questions as to what she  knew of Miss C.’s school. At all events he claimed that, in this instance,  such must be the case as the Legislature had expressly enacted that the pupils  should be witnesses. Mr. Ellsworth, in reply, said he apprehended the question  to be whether the Legislature possessed the power to compel a witness to  convict himself. He read from the opinion of Chief Justice Hosmer, in the 8  <sup>th</sup>  Con. Rep. and also from the case of the people vs. Mather, in 4  <sup>th</sup>  Wendell’s Reps on the subject of examining witnesses.&nbsp; By the principles  decided these cases, which were the settled law of the land, he claimed that  the witness was not compelled to answer any questions in relation to her  knowledge of this school. The Court decided that the witness, under the  circumstances, was not protected, but must be examined.—The examination was  about to proceed, when Mr. Ellsworth rose and stated to the Court that the  witness had been advised not to answer interrogatories in regard to her  knowledge of this school. He felt it to be his duty now to repeat this advice.  He wished the Court, however, distinctly to understand that the counsel for  the accused had taken this course not with a view to embarrass the trial, but  solely from a sense of duty. He conscientiously believed that the legal rights  of the witness were such that she should not be compelled to testify. The  Counsel for the prosecution, asked the witness when she came to Canterbury,  but she declined answering the question. A number of other questions were then  proposed to the witness, the principal of which were—“Has Miss Crandall kept a  school for colored girls not inhabitants of this state?”—“Will you say whether  the defendant has or has not instructed any person of color other than  yourself since the 10  <sup>th</sup>  of June last, or boarded and instructed colored persons not inhabitants of  this state?” To all these and other questions of a similar character, the  witness decline giving an answer, on the ground that she could not do so  without criminating herself. The counsel for the prosecution then called  <em>Catherine Ann Weldon</em>  and  <em>Eliza Hammond,</em>  both girls of color, and charged with being pupils of Miss Crandall, and  propounded to them the same questions as above; but they for the same reason,  and by the advice of counsel, declined answering. The prosecuting Attorney  reserved to himself, though he waived for the present, the right of moving for  an order that these witnesses be committed for a contempt of court.</p><p>  <em>Jacob C. Gould</em>  said he was acquainted with Ann Eliza Hammond. She belonged to Providence R.I.  had known her since she was a child—was the daughter of Thomas Hammond, who  died in 1826. Her mother now lived in Providence—the father at his death was  worth from 1500 to $2000 in real estate.</p><p>  <em>Levi Kneeland,</em>  Was not connected with Miss Crandall’s school except as an adviser in relation  to it—was pastor of the Church to which Miss Crandall belonged—had seen  several of the colored girls who were present at his church during the summer.  In reply to a question whether he had seen one of the girls elsewhere than at  his church declined answering. In reply to the question whether he had not  seen one of them at Miss Crandall’s, declined answering—decline to answer  whether he had advised Miss Crandall in relation to her school. Declined  answering whether or not he had been in Miss Crandall’s school since the 10  <sup>th</sup>  of June last. The court, having decided that he was bound to answer the  questions put to him, and that the reasons he offered for refusing to do so,  namely, that he might subject himself to a prosecution, and entangle himself  in difficulties, were insufficient, granted a motion for a mittimus to commit  him to prison and he was taken into custody by the Sheriff.</p><p>  <em>Eliza Parkis</em>  (a woman of color) was acquainted with Ann Eliza Hammond, one of the girls  that Miss Crandall was charged with having instructed. Has seen her in  Providence—has also seen her at Miss Crandall’s, and slept in a room with Miss  De Grasse a colored girl from New York. Miss Crandall employed witness to work  for her, because she said she did not wish to keep her scholars out of school  to do the work. Never saw any of the firls in school.—Have seen them have  books and study them.</p><p>  <em>Rowland Greene</em>  (affirmed) Has often heard that Miss Crandall kept a school for colored girls  in Canterbury—has been at the house often, was called as a physician—went  there and saw several colored girls—heard some of them recite in grammar,  geography, &amp;c. Some of the girls has been at his own house. Has seen a  little girl there, said to be from New York—has heard Miss Crandall talk  concerning her scholars from abroad—does not recollect to have heard her say  that they were from New York.</p><p>  <em>Mr. Kneeland</em>  was not placed at the bar by the Sheriff at his request, and said he intended  no disrespect to the Court by declining to answer the interrogatories put to  him, and being advised that he should not implicate himself by doing so, he  was ready to answer. He proceeded to state that he had visited Miss Crandall’s  school twice. Once it was under the charge of another person. He had prayed in  the school and conversed with the girls on religious subjects—does not  remember faces as well as people in general—could not therefore positively  identify any one of those present as being the ones seen at Miss  Crandall’s—should think they were—his best belief on the subject would be a  guess—has taken meals at Miss Crandall’s and eaten with her pupils—has heard  them recite their lessons—thinks he has heard Miss Hammond spoken of either by  the defendant or her sister. Miss Crandall has conversed with him in relation  to her scholars—thinks she has told him that some of them were from New York,  and some from Providence and New-Haven.</p><p>  <em>Albert Hinckley,</em>  has been at Miss Crandall’s several times since the month of June last—does  not know whether he has been in her school room as he knows not in which room  it is kept, has not conversed with her on the subject of the residence of her  scholars—called on her as a friend and conversed on various topics—has heard  that she kept a school for colored persons—has heard her speak of her scholars  and school—has seen colored ladies at her house and has taken tea with  them—cannot say whether any of those present were the ones or not.</p><p>  <em>Eliza Glasko,</em>  This witness was a colored girl belonging to the school but an inhabitant of  this state. The same objection was made to examining her as was before made in  respect to the others, but the objection was overruled by the Court. She  however declined answering the questions propounded to her. The prosecuting  attorney moved the court for a mittimus to commit the witness for contempt of  court. The court granted the motion and ordered the clerk to make out a  mittimus.</p><p>  <em>Hezekiah Crandall,</em>  (affirmed) His sister Prudence keeps a school at Canterbury for colored  girls—knows Ann Eliza Hammond—could not certainly recognize any other that was  present except perhaps Ann Peterson—has never been in the school nor heard the  pupils recite—has seen Ann Eliza Hammond at his sisters, often, during June  and July,—supposed she boarded there and was instructed by his sisters with  others—knows by sight and name Amelia Wildes—does not know where she is  now—has not heard his sister say any thing on the subject of her school for  some time—she has resided in Canterbury some portion of the time for twelve  years past.</p><p>  <em>James Chandler</em>  said he was at Miss Crandall’s several times last spring (not being able to  say with certainty whether he had been there since the passage of the law he  was not interrogated farther.)</p><p>  <em>George Roberts</em>  went to Miss Crandall’s about five months ag and carried a colored girl, Miss  Hammond to the school—Miss Hammond it was said belonged to Providence, has  been at Miss C’s since that time perhaps within ten weeks and drank tea—he  then saw Miss Hammond but does not know whether she boarded there constantly  or not—he heard her and other colored girls recite in Miss Crandall’s  school—should think this was two or three months ago—has been at Miss C’s  within a week but did not as he remembers see any of the girls present there  at that time.</p><p>  <em>Mary Benson</em>  (affirmed) Has been at Miss Crandall’s school and found it very  interesting—was never present but for a short time—‘tis for colored  persons—saw Ann Eliza Hammond there—she is one of the scholars and boards with  Miss C.—Witness recognized several of those present as among the number she  had seen at Miss Crandall’s—one of the pupils, Ann Weldon was from  New-York—Miss Hammond was from Providence—witness was at Miss Crandall’s five  weeks since and took tea—several colored girls were at the table—does not know  where any of them belonged except by report—visited the school when it was  near closing and heard Miss C. give the girls instruction in Geography and  Arithmetic. The prosecuting Attorney here rested his evidence, and the sheriff  having served his process on Eliza Glasko was about committing her to prison,  when Mr. Ellsworth interposed and stated to the court that rather than have  the girl committed he should advise her to testify—again repeating that the  course of the defendant’s counsel in relation to the testimony of these girls,  was dictated by an imperious sense of professional duty.</p><p>  <em>Eliza Glasko</em>  the proceeded to give testimony. She said she was a member of Miss C’s school,  and that the other girls near her were also members—one of them from  Providence, the other said to be from New-York—the ordinary branches were  taught them by Miss C.—reading, writing, grammar, geography, &amp;c., witness  begun to go on the first of April—the school was usually opened and closed  with prayer—the scriptures were read and explained daily in the school—some  portions were committed to memory by the pupils and considered a part of their  education.</p><p>Mr. Judson then opened the case on the part of the prosecution.</p><p>  He first stated the case and read the Act of the Legislature which he claimed  that Miss Crandall had violated. He said that this act did not prevent any  black from attending the district schools in the State, or any higher  schools—that they had all the benefits of the school und, and might attend the  academies, high schools, or colleges, and that too whether they were citizens  of this state, of other states, or of any part of the world. The sole  intention and provision of the act was, that colored persons, from another  jurisdiction, should not be intruded into any town in this state, without a  written permission from the select men and civil authority of the town in  which they proposed to reside. This was all, and this was perfectly lawful.  The whole tenor and effect of the law was to place a school for colored  persons under the care and supervision of the select men and civil authority  of each town. He should ask the attention of the Court to the face that the  Legislature had exercised a controlling power over schools within the limits  of the state since 1717. (Mr. Judson here read from an old edition of the  statutes, in respect to the power which the Legislature had exercised over  schools in respect to preventing disorders and the application of the public  money.)—These said Mr. Judson, were schools for the instruction of all  classes, and the acts which he had read, showed that the Legislature thought  proper to exercise care over these schools. Such was the ancient policy of the  state, and this new law was no change of policy. The state owed its present  honors, its present glories, to pursuing this policy of keepings its schools  under a supervising power. Nor was there anything in the Constitution of the  United States to prevent it. Towns, he claimed, had a right to say who should  be allowed to become inhabitants be residence in their limits and this law  gave them no more power than was necessary for the exercise of that right.  That the law was illiberal and reflected disgrace on the State, on the  Legislature which enacted it, he denied. On the contrary, said Mr. J., there  are now more than 1500 schools in the state, supported by our fund of  $1,800,000, to which blacks may go without the payment of a cent. Small as the  state was, smaller than single counties in some other states, these facts were  true concerning it. For himself he was proud of it. Where could a parallel be  found in the universe?</p><p>  Public policy, continued Mr. J., absolutely demands that a law of this  description should be maintained. It was claimed to be unconstitutional  because exclusive in its operation on a particular class. Other laws of the  state were liable to the same objection. Physicians and lawyers were instances  of the operation of our exclusive law. Tanners, Taverners, Surveyors, &amp;c.  must all be licensed. Manufactories were liable to be visited by the select  men and civil authority for the purpose of seeing that the children employed  in them were properly educated. If persons came here from other states and set  up manufacturing establishments they were equally liable to be visited in this  way though no such provisions existed in the laws of the states from whence  they come. Lawyers in this state could not purchase choses (??) in action. All  these laws, with many similar ones, were passed in derogation of rights  originally common to all; public policy however, required the enactment of  them, as it did of the one in question, and in his opinion they all stood on  similar grounds, and were, without question, in accordance with the  Constitution.</p><p>  Mr. J. next referred to the course which other states had pursued in  legislating on the subject of the blacks. He remarked on the law of Ohio. Our  law is not, said Mr. J., an act of exclusion, nor an act of prohibition. It  does not pretend to send away those who belong here, nor does it prohibit any  from coming, but only makes it necessary that permission be first obtained.  The laws of Georgia and North Carolina went so far as to authorise the  imprisonment of blacks who came within their limits, even though they came in  the capacity of cooks and stewards of vessels. In Tennessee blacks could not  come from other states and remain within the state above twelve days without  incurring penalties. In Maryland a man could not manumit his slave without his  leaving the state. Even in Pennsylvania, “the land of Penn,” no free negro  could remain without giving bonds for his support. All these laws Mr. J.  claimed to be obnoxious to equal and indeed to greater constitutional  objections than the one in question. The article in the constitution of the  United States with which this law was supposed to conflict, he understood to  be, the 2d section of the 4  <sup>th</sup>  article:—“The citizens of each state shall be entitled to all the privileges  and immunities of citizens in the several states.” Mr. J. claimed that the  term “citizens” in this place, and throughout the constitution, had a  technical signification—a legal meaning—that it did not include colored  persons—that they were not be the constitution recognized as citizens. A  certain class of colored persons, slaves) were in it considered as property.</p><p>  Mr. J. here referred to the laws of the United State on the subject of  naturalization, reading from Ingersoll’s Digest, the several acts of Congress,  and insisted that from them all, the language being precise, technical, and  certain, none other than white persons could be naturalized citizens of the  United States. He also read from the 2  <sup>nd</sup>  Kent’s Com. 70, 71, 72, by which he further illustrated these views.</p><p>  There have been, continued Mr. J., concurrent acts of the State of Connecticut  which give the same construction to the constitution. If “citizen” do not mean  a white person only—if it be claimed that a black is a citizen, then is the  constitution of our own State a nullity, for it allows “free white males”  alone to be electors. The privilege of being a freeman, he claimed, to be a  higher one that the right of being educated. Why should a man be educated who  could not be a freeman? A person who pays a single cent State tax, or who does  military duty, is entitled to the privilege of voting. In Massachusetts these  qualifications were not sufficient. Each state in the Union has these local  laws and customs peculiar to itself—these must all be abrogated at a blow, by  deciding the law in question to be unconstitutional. Full effect however,  might be given to the clause in the constitution, referred to without  producing this result, and that was, by construing the term “citizen” in the  manner he had before pointed out.</p><p>  The first act in our own statute would be nullified by a decision that this  law was unconstitutional—a citizen of another State cannot maintain an action  in our courts for any cause unless a substantial inhabitant of the State give  bond for him. No one has doubted the constitutionality of this law, and the  law in question, with respect to constitutionality, could not be distinguished  from it.</p><p>  Mr. J. said he should conclude his remarks on this subject by alluding merely  to one other argument in support of this law, and that was, that the public  safety of this State, the preservation of its true interests, required this  law to be enforced. The southern States might emancipate their slaves and send  them all to Connecticut instead of Liberia. The influx of that species of  population might be so great as to be overwhelming. (Mr. J. proceeded to  remark on the effect which recent measures of the British Parliament, on the  subject of slavery, might have on this question, when he was interrupted by  the court, who remarked that tho’ far from inclined to restrain all the limits  of the discussion, yet it did not seem pertinent to the issue to argue the  policy or expediency of the laws. Mr. J. said he would not press the point.)  Mr. J. hoped that he had not been misunderstood in the remarks he had made. He  wished not to oppress any class of population. He heartily wished that every  slave might be emancipated that every day. But if it could not be done without  destruction to our constitutions, and desolating our land, he could not desire  it.</p><p>  He would only add to the Jury that though it was true they were at liberty to  consider what the court said to them on the subject of the law, as advice,  still he hoped they would pay it such respect as advice from the bench was  properly entitled to. A single word as to the facts. The information charged  the defendant with boarding and instructing, in different counts. It was  sufficient if they found her guilty on either. The day was immaterial. If they  found her guilty of doing the act charged on any day, since the passage of the  law, and before the filing of the information, ‘twas sufficient. It was not  necessary that they should find that she had boarded or instructed each of the  persons named in the information; to instruct or board one was a transgression  of the law.</p><p>As to the proof it was abundant, conclusive.</p><p>  Mr. Ellsworth, after stating the case, and remarking on the prohibitions of  the law, said that he proposed not to occupy time in relation to the facts of  the case. He would willingly have advised the pupils of Miss Crandall to have  testified had he not believed that in so doing they voluntarily surrendered  their most sacred rights. True it was, the defendant has kept this  school—‘twas no secret, and whether that constituted a crime or not was for  the jury to determine. In order to convict my client, said Mr. E., you  gentlemen, must find on your oaths that she had committed a crime. You may  find that she has violated an act of the State Legislature, but if you also  find her protected by a higher power, it will be your duty to acquit. The  court he was fully assured, would charge the jury that the law was  unconstitutional, I they so believed, but after all, it belonged to the people  to determine whether one of them had been guilty of a crime. Each one of the  jury must be satisfied for himself alone, that a crime has been committed. He  flattered himself that he should be able to lead them to the conclusion that  the law in question was a violation of the constitution of this State and of  the United States. The constitution of the United States was the highest power  known in our land. Beyond that, no Legislature can go and if the jury find the  law not to stand well with the constitution they must say so.</p><p>  The real question for the jury to settle Mr. Ellsworth apprehended to be this:  Can the Legislature of Connecticut pass a law prohibiting the citizens of  other States from coming into this State, and&nbsp; there residing, to  prosecute the acquisition of knowledge, in a way open to the citizens of this  State. This he believed was the precise question, and it reached deep and  wide—wider and deeper than was perhaps imagined. It was however claimed by his  friend from Canterbury, that colored persons were not citizens, and that the  provisions of the constitution, with respect to citizens of the United States,  did not apply to this class of our population. The criterion of citizenship  was complexion in the view of the gentleman who had preceded him. I said Mr.  E., make the criterion to be either birth or naturalization. Admitting that  none but white persons can be naturalized, it does not touch the question of  citizenship by birth. Is it so that a person born on our soil, is not a  citizen of our soil? In the days of Revolution, said Mr. E., these men fought  side by side with our fathers, and shed their blood for their country—the  country to which they owed indefeasible allegiance. Their names were now  inscribed on the Pension Rolls of the Government—they now received the  honorable trophies of the services they had rendered. Where, said Mr. E., does  the gentleman get the doctrine that the rights of man, as a citizen, depend  upon his color? A colored man could appeal to the laws for the protection of  his rights in ever State could he, if he were not a citizen? (Mr. E. here read  a few sentences from the commencement of the declaration of independence,  which, he said, according to the argument of the gentleman opposed to him,  ought to be changed so as to have the words “except black people” introduced  between each clause,) Mr. E. said he was a republican, he claimed to be as  much a republican as his friend from Canterbury, and he hoped that his friend  was not so ashamed of his republicanism, as to wish this instrument, the  Declaration of Independence, interpolated in this manner. Our own  constitution, continued Mr. E., recognized, in express terms, equality of  rights—that men were equal in rights, but to this the gentleman would add  “except black men.” He hoped he should not live long enough to see such  doctrine go forth from Connecticut. The free colored population has, and is  justly entitled, to equal representation in the Congress of the United States  with the white population. Could not a black man commit treason? The gentleman  would have it that he could not, for none other than citizens can. (Mr. E.  here read from the 2  <sup>nd</sup>  Kent’s Com on the subject of citizenship, by birth.) I scout the idea, said  Mr. E., that a man, born here by the side of me, is not a citizen because, his  father was black, while I am a citizen because mine was white.</p><p>  [The remainder of Mr. Ellsworth’s argument next week together with those of  Messrs.

If any such  will take the trouble to read the following account of the effects of  emancipation as far as it has hitherto been tried, they will perhaps see that  their fears on the subject are not justified by experience.</p><p>  The History of Hayti when separated from the accidental circumstances  attending it, furnishes irrefragable evidence of the safety and advantage of  immediate emancipation. It is true that much blood was shed there during the  French revolution; but this was not owing to the emancipation of the slaves,  but was the consequence either of the civil war which preceded the act of  emancipation; or of the atrocious attempt to restore slavery.</p><p>  In September, 1793, Polvirel, one of the Commissioners sent to St. Domingo by  the National Convention, issues a proclamation declaring the whole of the  slaves in the island free. Colonel Malenfant, a slave proprietor, resident at  the time in the island, thus describes the effects of this sudden measure.  “After this public act of emancipation, the Negroes remained quiet both in the  south and in the west, and they continued to work upon all the plantations.  There were estates which had neither owners nor managers resident upon them,  and on those estates where no white men were left to direct them, they betook  themselves to the planting of provisions; but upon all plantations where the  whites resided, the blacks continued to labor as quietly as before.” Colonel  Malenfant says, that when many of his neighbors, proprietors or managers, were  in prison, the negroes of their plantations came to him to beg him to direct  them in their work. “If you will take care not to talk to them of the  restoration of slavery, but talk to them of freedom, you may with this word  chain them down to their labor. How did Toussaint succeed?—How did I succeed  before is time in the plain of the Culde-Sac on the plantation Gourand, during  more than eight months after liberty had been granted to the slaves? Let those  who knew me at that time, let the blacks themselves, be asked: they will all  reply that not a single negro upon that plantation, consisting of more than  four hundred and fifty laborers, refused to work: and yet this plantation was  thought to be under the worst discipline and the slaves the most idle of any  in the plain. I inspired the same activity into three other plantations of  which I had the management. I all the negroes had come from Africa within six  months, if they had the love of independence that the Indians have, I should  own that force must be employed; but ninety-nine out of a hundred of the  blacks are aware that without labor they cannot procure the things that are  necessary for them; that there is no other method of satisfying their wants  and their tastes. They know that they must work; the wish to do so, and they  will do so.”</p><p>  Such was the conduct of the negroes for the first nine months after their  liberation, or up to the middle of 1794. In the latter part of 1796, Malenfant  says, “The colony was flourishing under Toussaint, the whites lived happily  and in peace upon their estates, and the negroes continued to work for them”  General Lecroix who published his “Memoirs for a history of St. Domingo” in  1819, says that in 1797 the most wonderful progress had been made in  agriculture. “The Colony,” said he, “marched as by enchantment towards its  ancient splendor: cultivation prospered; every day produced perceptible proof  of its progress.” General Vincent, who was a general of brigade of artillery  in St. Domingo and a proprietor of estates in the island, was sent by  Toussaint to Paris in 1801 to lay before the Directory the new constitution  which had been agreed upon in St. Domingo. He arrived in France just at the  moment of the peace of Amiens, and found that Bonaparte was preparing an  armament for the purpose of restoring slavery in St. Domingo. He remonstrated  against the expedition; he stated that it was totally unnecessary and  therefore criminal, for that every thing was going on well in St. Domingo. The  proprietors were in peaceable possessions of their estates; cultivation was  making rapid progress; the blacks were industrious and beyond example happy.  He conjured him, therefore not to reverse this beautiful state of things, but  his efforts were ineffectual, and the expedition arrived upon the shores of  St. Domingo. At length, however, the French were driven from the island. Till  that time the planters had retained their property, and then it was, and not  till then, that they lost their all. In 1804 Dessalines was proclaimed  Emperor; in process of time a great part of the black troops were disbanded,  and returned to cultivation again. From that time to this, there has been no  want o subordination or industry among them.</p><p>  The following account of the character and condition of the negroes of Hayti,  at a later period, is taken from “Sketches of Hayti” by Mr. Harvey, who during  the latter part of the reign of Christophe spent a considerable time at Cape  François the capital of his dominions. “The cultivators who formed the great  mass of the population, resided on or near the plantations of which they were  appointed to labor. A great proportion of them were engaged in cultivating the  estates of the king; if soldiers, they were fed and clothed at his expense; if  regular cultivators, they received such a share of the produce as was fully  adequate to yield them a competent maintenance. Others were in the employ of  the nobles and officers, who received either stated wages or such a portion of  the article they cultivated as was deemed a sufficient reward for their  industry, were equally supplied with whatever could contribute to their  comfort. And those who by their exertions and economy were enabled to procure  small spots of land of their own or to hold the smaller plantations at an  annual rent, were diligently engaged in cultivating coffee, sugar, and other  articles, which they disposed of to the inhabitants of the adjacent towns and  villages. It was an interesting sight to behold this class o the Haytians, now  in possession of their freedom, coming in groups to the market nearest which  they resided, bringing the produce of their industry for sale; and afterwards  returning, carrying back the necessary articles of living which the disposal  of their commodities had enabled them to purchase; all evidently cheerful and  happy. Nor could it fail to occur to the mind that their present condition  furnished the most satisfactory answer to that objection to the general  emancipation of slaves, founded on their alleged unfitness to value and  improve the benefits of liberty.</p><p>  Though of the same race and possessing the same general traits of character as  the negroes of the other West India islands, they are already distinguished  from them by habits of industry and activity such as slaves are seldom known  to exhibit. As they would not suffer, so they do not require the attendance of  one acting in the capacity of a driver with the instrument of punishment in  his hand.—As far as I had an opportunity of ascertaining from what fell under  my own observation, and from what I gathered from other European residents, I  am persuaded of one general fact which on account of its importance I shall  state in the most explicit terms, viz: that the Haytians employed in  cultivating the plantations, as well as the rest of the population, perform as  much work in a given time as they were accustomed to do during their  subjection to the French. And if we may judge of their future improvement by  the change which has already effected, it may be reasonably anticipated that  Hayti will ere long contain a population not inferior in their industry to  that of any civilized nation in the world.</p><p>  While the interior of this island was in this improving state, and its  inhabitants were peaceful and industrious, Cape Francois and other towns  presented scenes of the utmost order and activity: the great majority of the  inhabitants of Cape Francois consisted of trades-people and mechanics, the  former of whom were supplied by the resident merchants with cloths, linens,  silks and other manufactures, which they sold to the natives in small  quantities. Their business was seldom so great as to enable them to amass  fortunes, but it afforded them ample means of support. Towards strangers who  entered their shops, whether for the purpose of making purchases or not, they  were invariably and remarkably civil; a trait in the character of Christophe’s  subjects which I believe to have been universal. The mechanics, though many of  them were deficient in skill from having been imperfectly instructed, were all  enabled by their industry to gain a competent maintenance. On the whole, the  scene which Cape Francois presented was as interesting as it was in many  respects surprising. In few places of commerce could there be seen greater  regularity in the despatch [sic] of business, greater diligence displayed by  those engaged in it, or more evident marks of a prosperous state of things.  Every man had some calling to occupy his attention; instances of idleness or  intemperance were of rare occurrence, the most perfect subordination  prevailed, and all appeared contented and happy. A foreigner would have found  it difficult to persuade himself on his first entering the place, that the  people he now beheld so submissive, industrious and contented, were the same  people who a few years before has escaped from the shackles of slavery.”</p><p>  A gentleman who had been for upwards of twenty years past a general merchant  in Hayti, frequently crossing to Europe and America, gave the following  account of the condition of the Haytians to Capt. Stuart at Belfast last  winter. The present population he supposes consists of at least seven hundred  thousand. He said that there was very universal happiness amongst them,—and  that though their conduct was not unexceptionable, yet there was a less  distress, than in any other country of his knowledge. That they obtained  abundance by their own labor.—There were no paupers except the decrepid [sic]  and aged: that the people were very charitable, hospitable and kind, very  respectful to Europeans, temperate, grateul, faithful, orderly and submissive,  easily governable, lively and contented, good mechanics, and that no corporal  punishments are allowed.</p>","Scholarly Notes":"Ye gads this article is objectionable.

It is a truly sublime object—sublime in itself, as  filling the mind with wonder, where the stones came from, how they could have  been brought there, and placed in their relative positions! The heaviest  columns are rated at seventy tons—the whole number being ninety-four, as near  as can be ascertained, although the present confusion of the assemblage  renders it difficult to count them. It is supposed to have been a Druidical  temple, where human sacrifices were offered—a superstition as sublime as it  was diabolical, as mysterious as cruel! The rude grandeur of the work  demonstrates the barbarity of the age. There are no indications, that this  place of sacrifice was ever enclosed by walls, or covered by a roof. It is  encircled indeed by the traces of a ditch and a corresponding embankment, and  the columnar ranges of stones were set up in circular lines, at greater  distance from each other than the space occupied. About half an acre is  enclosed by the circumvallation, and a quarter of an acre occupied by the  temple itself. The only junction of the structure if structure it can be  called, appears to have been the resting of the amazing cross and horizontal  slabs on the largest columns, about 20 ft. high &amp; 15 asunder, most of  which have fallen, some are inclined, and a few only standing erect. Tenons  were left on the top of the perpendicular columns, entering grooves of the  horizontal pieces laid upon them. It is barely possible, that the mechanical  powers of the present age could set up an edifice like this; but the rudeness  of the work does not naturally suggest the knowledge and application of such  powers at the time of its creation. Hence the wonder.</p><p>  It is said by some, that the same material is not to be found in this island.  It is incredible, however, that these immense rocks should have been shipped;  and almost equally incredible, that they should have been transported any  considerable distance on trundles; and yet they were never found in this  vicinity. Many of them are reduced to nearly right angles, but more exhibit a  smooth, or properly plane surface. There is nothing like the skill of masonry  bestowed upon them. They are perhaps purposely left in this rude state, as  emblematic of the stern and inexorable rites which they were set up to  witness. The supposed altar piece lies in the centre, embedded in the earth,  and directly behind it two of the largest columns supported the heaviest  cross-beam—but the columns have inclined and dropped their burden.</p><p>  There are other relics of the kind in the island, but none so stupendous. All  the parts of a similar temple have been transferred at great expense from the  island of Jersey, and set up on the estate of a private gentleman at  Henley-on-Thames, now the property of a Mr. Maitland. I stumbled upon it the  other day in rambling over the grounds with a friend, and found it perched on  a hill some four or five hundred feet above the bed of the Thames. It was  brought over by a former governor of the island, Gen. Conway, who then owned  Park-place, on which it now stands. It is of course a small chapel, compared  with  <em>Stonehenge</em>  on Salisbury Plain—but many of the stones are of several tons weight. They are  rude and shapeless.</p><p>  There are numerous marks of ancient military fortifications, scattered over  Salisbury Plain; and tumuli of the ancient dead, such as are to be found in  the Western regions of our own country, lift up their heads in various  quarters, and sometimes in groups.</p><p>  Old Sarum, of recent fame, as a rotten borough of England, sending two members  to Parliament under the late  <em>regime</em>  , is a naked fortification in ruins, two miles from Salisbury. It is as  desolate as the crown of Ben Nevis in Scotland.</p><p>  My sensations in visiting Stonehenge were the result of a singular combination  of the grateful recollections of Mrs. More’s Shepherd and his family, and of  the actual scenes before me. “The Shepherd of Salisbury Plain” was continually  ringing in my ear, and all his history passing before me, as I rode over these  undulating, naked, and apparently boundless fields, among the tumuli and  traces of ancient fortifications, and came at last to gaze upon and admire  this wonder-exciting and unaccountable relic of a barbarous age and bloody  superstition. What a demonstration of man’s susceptibilities of religious  affections, of a sense of guilt, of his need of atonement, and of the dreadful  errors, into which he may be plunged without the guidance of a divine  revelation!</p>","Scholarly Notes":"An unusual decision, for page one at the time of the trial.

The gentlemanthen asked him for the 90<sup>th</sup>verse of the 7<sup>th</sup>chapter of Numbers.

The  court he was fully assured, would charge the jury that the law was  unconstitutional, I they so believed, but after all, it belonged to the people  to determine whether one of them had been guilty of a crime. Each one of the  jury must be satisfied for himself alone, that a crime has been committed. He  flattered himself that he should be able to lead them to the conclusion that  the law in question was a violation of the constitution of this State and of  the United States.—The constitution of the United States was the highest power  known in our land. Beyond that, no Legislature can go, and if the jury find  the law not to stand well with the constitution they must say so.</p><p>  The real question for the jury to settle Mr Ellsworth apprehended to be this:  Can the Legislature of Connecticut pass a law prohibiting the citizens of  other States from coming into this State, and there residing, to prosecute the  acquisition of knowledge, in a way open to the citizens of this State. This he  believed was the precise question, and it reached deep and wide—wider and  deeper than was perhaps imagined. It was however claimed by his friend from  Canterbury, that colored persons were not citizens, and that the provisions of  the constitution, with respect to citizens of the United States, did not apply  to this class of our population. The criterion of citizenship was complexion,  in the view of the gentleman who had preceded him. I, said Mr E., make the  criterion to be either birth or naturalization. Admitting that none but white  persons can be naturalized, it does not touch the question of citizenship by  birth. Is it so that a person born on our soil, is not a citizen of our soil?  In the days of Revolution, said Mr E., these men fought side by side with our  fathers, and shed their blood for this country, which as their country—the  country to which they owed indefeasible allegiance. Their names were no  inscribed on the Pension Rolls of the Government—they now received the  honorable trophies of the services they had rendered. Where, said Mr E., does  the gentleman get the doctrine that the rights of man, as a citizen, depend  upon his color? A colored man could appeal to the laws for the protection of  his rights in every State; could he, if he were not a citizen? (Mr. E. here  read a few sentences from the commencement of the declaration of independence,  which, he said, according to the argument of the gentleman opposed to him,  ought to be changed so as to have the words “except black people” introduced  between each clause). Mr E. said he was a republican, he claimed to be as much  of a republican as his friend from Canterbury, and he hoped that his friend  was not so ashamed of his republicanism, as to wish this instrument, the  Declaration of Independence, interpolated in this manner. Our own  constitution, continued Mr E., recognized, in express terms, equality of  rights—that men were equal in rights, but to this the gentleman would add  “except black men.” He hoped he should not live long enough to see such  doctrine go forth from Connecticut. The free colored population has, and is  justly entitled, to equal representation in the Congress of the United States  with the white population. Could not a black man commit treason? The gentleman  would have it that he could not, for none other than citizens can. Mr E. here  read from the 2d Kent’s Com. on the subject of citizenship, by birth.) I scout  the Idea, said Mr E., that a man, born here by the side of me, is not a  citizen because, his father was black, while I am a citizen because mine was  white.</p><p>  Mr E. said that the argument which his friend had drawn from the fact that our  state constitution provided that none but white citizens should become  electors, would seem to be based on the assumption that the right of voting  was a criterion of citizenship. Is this, he asked, the fact? Was the right of  voting a test of citizenship? If it is, where are our wives and daughters?  Citizens, or not? Would the gentleman denationalize them? How could persons  born here be aliens? Mr E. then proceeded to examine more minutely the  abstract question which he had before stated. It was, he said, a great  question, one which he had not doubt would make a figure in the future history  of this country. If, said Mr E., resident citizens of this state may choose  their own instructors, then, he believe, that citizens from other states, here  by their sides, may also choose theirs. If the Legislature of Connecticut can  say to a black citizen of New York that he shall not come here to be  instructed he may say so to the white citizen. Where is the distinction? It  comes then to this, our Legislature can say as to the population of an  adjacent state, for instance New York, it is corrupt, and its citizens shall  not come within our limits—be they white or black it makes no difference. A  barrier was thus at once erected around our state. An absurdity so manifest as  this must strike every mind. Nothing but a high state of excitement could ever  have caused the enactment of such a law as the present. The citizens of  Canterbury he had no doubt, would, on reflection, perceive the impropriety of  their course. The care and supervision which the Legislature had exercised  over schools in this state did not, as Mr E. apprehended imply the right to  exercise any such power as that set up in the new law.</p><p>  The law, which regulate trades and professions, to which allusion has been  made, were also, he said, of an entirely different character. These  regulations and restrictions, it must be remembered, were the same for all.  Whether one belonged to the state or not, these laws knew no difference. The  new law has made a difference, and in that consisted the difficulty. The  application of the new law must depend upon the fact whether a person was born  in or out of the state. The Legislature leave the black man born here, the  freedom of selecting his own instructor, and the place of instruction for his  child. This privilege is denied to the black man who comes here, if it so  happens that he was born out of the state. But, says the gentleman, his  children may go to the district schools, to any of the high schools of  academies in the state. The benefits which colored children would derive from  these schools, said Mr E. would not be worth a pinch of snuff, and the  gentleman knows it.—The blacks in Hartford had petitioned for a separate  school, in order that they might have the benefit of the public money, which  they did not enjoy now, as they were ever made hewers of wood and drawers of  water, and considered the offscouring of the schools which they attended. They  made commotion in every school the moment they entered it. There existed then  a necessity for separate schools.—He was not going abreast of any principle of  supervision which the state could properly exercise over schools, or over  trades and professions, by contending for the rights of citizens to choose  their own instructors, and the place of instruction, for their children,  whether they were or were not citizens of this state. The old statute in  relation to paupers was considered as upholding this law. By it, persons  liable to become chargeable might be warned to depart, and might be publicly  whipped if they did not obey the mandate. He would here thank his friend from  Canterbury for obtaining a repeal of that portion of the law by which whipping  was imposed. Mr E. apprehended that a state possessed the power of preventing  the settlement, within its limits, of those likely to become paupers, but that  the state had the power of keeping out very body from other states, he denied  altogether. Will it be said that the law in question does not go this extent?  If a citizen of Massachusetts may come into this state and settle down, what  is he here for? Must he be a drone? What is the privilege of moving worth to  him? Citizens of other states may come here and become farmers, or lawyers,  (that would be a poor business, said Mr E.) or doctors. They may, when here,  said Mr E. do what citizens here may do, or the constitution is not worth a  rush. ‘Twas claimed that blacks might come here and go to other schools. Might  not the Legislature then say to them, and to all others, you shall send your  children to the Presbyterian school—to the Baptist school, or to the Methodist  school? Might not the Legislature further say, we do not like Roman Catholics,  and we will therefore have no school where Catholics instruct? Gentlemen must  go this length, who advocate this law. Would it be claimed that the fact of  putting this power in the hands of the select men to exercise, made any  difference? This was a mere parade of liberality—the select men of Canterbury  would sooner shed their blood than grant Miss Crandall permission to keep this  school. The power to license, said Mr E., is a power to deny—and we are to  hold our most sacred rights and privileges at the pleasure of the select men;  they can grant or they can prohibit.</p><p>  Mr E. now proceeded to consider the rights which citizens of each state are  entitled to enjoy in the several states. He read from the opinion of Judge  Washington, as reported in the 4  <sup>th</sup>  of Washington’s Circuit Court Reps. page 380, which he claimed showed  conclusively that the new law of Connecticut was unconstitutional. He also  maintained that the views he took of this law were supported by Judge Story,  in the third volume of his recent work on the Constitution and also in  Sergeant’s Constitutional law, page 385. The legislation of Congress on the  subject of the Missouri question, he claimed distinctly recognized blacks as  Citizens. The law when it says that no person shall keep a school for the  instruction of blacks from abroad, says, in effect, that no foreign person  shall come here and be taught—How were they to be taught without a teacher?  This law would extinguish the light of knowledge—would degrade those who are  now degraded, and depress those who are now depressed. It said to the naked,  go unclothed, and to the hungry, go unfed. The distinctions which now existed  on account of color were sufficiently great—the colored people had now  difficulties enough to struggle with—he hoped they would not be increased.</p><p>  The general policy of this law, continued Mr E., and its connexion with the  subject of slavery, though a question touching deep feelings, cannot, without  impropriety, be discussed here. Had he been a member of the legislature that  enacted it, he might have said something on the subject, but should refrain  from it on the present occasion.</p><p>  In conclusion, Mr. Ellsworth thanked the jury for the attention they had paid  to his remarks, which, he said, were quite unsatisfactory to himself. He hoped  they would see their way clear, before they found his client guilty of a crime  for endeavoring to elevate and enlighten an unfortunate portion of our race.  Were they prepared to say that teaching the word of God was a crime? That it  was a crime to teach children the Bible? He left the case with them. He  trusted that the court would tell them that the law was unconstitutional, but  if they should not, my appeal, said Mr E., is to THE PEOPLE, and to THE PEOPLE  I leave my client.</p><p>  Mr. Strong said that after the very full, and eloquent, and conclusive  argument o his brother Ellsworth, it would be more grateful to his feelings to  leave the case in the hands of the jury without adding a word. He feared that  he should rather diminish than add to the force of that argument. He however  found an&nbsp; apology for occupying a short time, in the magnitude of the  case under consideration. It involves the liberties of the people.</p><p>  Those who advocate the cause of the defendant, said Mr. S., are charged with  endeavoring to nullify the laws. What is nullification? An attempt by the  Legislature of a state, to destroy a power higher than itself. South Carolina  had done this to the fullest extent—our own state had made some progress, but  the right of trial by jury was still left us. A culprit is here arraigned—a  female—by the courtesy of the court she had not been called upon to hold up  her hand, and plead to the information against her, but she nevertheless stood  there as a criminal. She was charged with giving instruction, but there was no  pretence that she has inculcated bad principles. He had heard of a land where  this might be criminal, but it was a land where despots reigned. Her crime  consisted in this, that she had given light to thoses who were in mental  darkness—had taught those who were ignorant, to read the bible. It was true  that the persons to whom she had given instruction were descendants of that  unfortunate race, who were even in a state of slavery in this country. He said  this not to their reproach, but to our own. He rejoiced that public sentiment  had changed on the subject—but one feeling now exists &amp; that was not  peculiar to our own country. The Legislature of Great Britain was engaged in  passing a law of a very different character from the one now in question, at  the very time that our Legislature passed this. Even in a country where a king  and nobles constituted one branch of the legislature, a law had been passed,  almost simultaneously with our own, strikingly dissimilar in its provisions.  We complained that this class of persons were low, degraded, and addicted to  crime. Has God made them so, or have they been made so by ignorance? ‘Twas a  little boon to give them liberty, and keep them in ignorance. Better to rivet  the chains of slavery, then to break those and rivet again the chains of  ignorance. But one sentiment now pervaded the people of this country, with  respect to educating these people—there was a difference as to the way. Some  were for colonizing them, others had different views, but all agreed they  ought to be instructed in some way. If they were carried out of the country in  ignorance, was it not carrying them away that they might destroy themselves.  Unless education accompanied them all was in vain. What, asked Mr. S., has  been the course pursued by the defendant? He rejoiced that her pupils had been  before the jury, and that they had had opportunities of seeing them. Were they  not worthy of being instructed? Had not the defendant entirely deferred to  public sentiment, in relation to keeping the races separate? What more  feasible course for educating these people could be point out, than the one  she had adopted? The colored race could not educate themselves—unless some  person would step forward and overcome these prejudices, whether rightful or  not, he should not decide, they must ever live in ignorance.</p><p>MR. STRONG, next proceeded to remark on the law.</p><p>  He read the preamble and said it put him in mind of the painter, who affixed a  label to his pictures, lest the spectators might not otherwise be able to  determine what animal he intended to delineate. The question, continued Mr S.,  is often asked, :would you be willing to have a school of this description in  your own neighborhood?” What if we should not, could we put it down by passing  an unconstitutional law? What if I did not wish my neighbor to keep a large  number of dogs, could I of course compel him to put them away? This law does  not prevent colored persons from coming to this State. They may come and be  idle, and welcome—they may come for any earthly purpose except education. That  they are told they must get in the district schools. In these schools, the  colored class sit on the lowest bench. They cannot go to these schools—as soon  as their minds become a little expanded, they must retire from them. He wished  to have an instance pointed out where any black had continued to attend, for  any length of time, and derived benefit. It was impossible that such should be  the case as things now were. What they desired was a school by themselves,  where, and only where, they could acquire an education. They asked of us  bread, but we gave them a stone—they asked a fish, but we gave them a  scorpion—there was the sting of reproach in it. We place our foot on the  black, and hold him down in the dust, and then complain that he does not grow  to the perfect stature of a man. There was but one Academy in the State where  they could be admitted at all, and this was by the munificence of a private  individual—he alluded to the late Mr Bacon of Colchester. He should have  supposed by the argument of the gentleman who opened the case for the  prosecution, that the new act would open the doors [of] every academy and  college in the State. The proviso in the law amounted to nothing—it might as  well have provided that nothing in that act should be construed to prevent  colored persons from holding all the Bank stock in the State. The act exposed  one to penalties who should instruct a colored person, from another State, in  a sabbath school. It compelled us to obtain a license to seek out the poor,  the ignorant, the destitute, and the benighted.</p><p>  It is claimed, said Mr S., that the legislature have the power to regulate  schools—be it so. He asked however to be pointed to an instance where the  regulation depended on the character of the scholar. This law excluded those  whom it pronounced bad. He would say, let all be instructed, particularly the  bad that they might be made better. He spoke however with confidence, when he  said, that no law had ever existed, in this State, to regulate private school.  (Mr S. then read from some of the ancient statutes, regulating schools,  appointing inspectors, &amp;c.) The legislature, continued Mr S., regulated  these schools because they had established them, and they undoubtedly might do  so. Was this power claimed in order to prevent bad principles from being  taught? He did not perceive that the defendant had offended in this respect.  There was nothing had in teaching arithmetic, geography, grammar, and the  bible. If this however was the object of the law, whom did it protect? Our own  citizens? No—we might teach them every thing naughty that we chose, but were  restrained from doing so to those who came from abroad. This, said Mr S., is  really the most  <em>diffusive</em>  kind of benevolence I ever heard of. Most of our criminal laws, continued Mr  S., gives the court some discretionary power in imposing punishment, in this  law the penalty is fixed, if the law itself be not fixed—if it be not pierced  by the spear which emanated from the constitution. All public officers are  sworn to support the constitution of the United States, and if any law  interferes with that, it must be disregarded—otherwise they would incur the  guilt of perjury. Whether any of the jury had taken this oath, he knew not,  nor was it material to his argument. The Constitution of the United States was  the supreme law, and must be regarded by all citizens, whether public officers  or not. He meant to speak with all respect of the opinion of the Court, and  though in civil matters the jury were bound to take the law as given from the  Bench, it was otherwise in criminal questions. Here the Court advise, and the  jury decide.</p><p>  He intended no disrespect to the legislature which enacted this law, by the  animadversions which he made concerning it. It was notorious that public  feeling frequently exercised a strong influence in regard to the passage of  laws. As an instance of this, he would refer to a law passed a few years since  in this State, called the Steam-boat law. In this law, we cut off many of our  privileges for the sake of retaliating on the State of New-York. The law was  passed by acclamation. Gov. Wolcott sent a sensible well written message to  the legislature, suggesting its impolicy and unconstitutionality, but it was  no more regarded than if he had sent a page of the spelling book—it did not  change a vote. The Dartmouth College case was another instance of the passage  of a State law, in time of high excitement. Again and again had our sacred  constitution been called to exert its conservative principle.</p><p>  Mr S. said that it was with some surprise that he had listened to the  statement of the opening Counsel for the prosecution, as to the law of  Pennsylvania, relating to the residence of blacks in their limits. What the  gentleman asserted to be the law of that State, which he had so properly  styled “the land of Penn,” was a bill reported to the legislature, but never  passed into a law. Other bills had been framed and prepared to pass, in other  legislatures, which Mr S. apprehended would form a miscellaneous collection.  It would greatly gratify his curiosity, could he get a sight of some of them.  It was no reflection on the character of our State, that under excitement, it  had passed an unconstitutional law—other States had done the same. Mr S. here  referred to the second section of the 4  <sup>th</sup>  Article of the constitution, on which he said he relied to prove the  unconstitutionality of the law. He also read from the articles o  confederation, which he claimed to contain a similar provision. By the  adoption of the constitution, we were, said Mr S., made one people. ‘Twas  necessary—‘twas the principle of the proclamation of Gen. Jackson, so  deservedly popular throughout this section of the Country. If this principle  was impugned, it destroyed that which alone made our government worth  anything. (Mr. S. also read from Judge Story what had before been quoted by Mr  Ellsworth) In ancient times, continued Mr S., it was a proud boast—“I am a  Roman citizen.” A citizen of the United States was entitled to one no less  proud—I am an American citizen. We were not to say that we were citizens of  Connecticut, but that we were American citizens. A portion of our country men  might wish to raise the Palmetto banner, but the eagle and the stripes were  our badge. The attorney for the prosecution would improve upon the  Nullification of South Carolina. That State had only to pass an act excluding  the standing army o the United States from her territory, and the principles  of the old General’s proclamation were all nullified, or Mr S. was greatly  mistaken. Were blacks citizens? The term “citizen” was to have a technical  sense. He had listened with pleasure to this remark from the gentleman who  opened the case, for when a word has a technical signification, it was always  easy to get its precise meaning. All the technics however which seemed to  attach to the word were that a citizen must not be colored. If colored persons  were not citizens, Mr S. claimed that they were not inhabitants, which  conclusion was manifestly absurd. Color had no connection with the question of  citizenship be birth, though it had in respect to naturalization. In deference  to southern views, the Militia laws of the nation, passed in 1792, did not  include colored persons—the words were, “every free white male citizen”—was  not this an express recognition that persons other than whites were citizens?  If “citiens” meant a white person only, why was this language used? (Mr S.  here read from Ingersoll’s digest 745, relative to the protections granted to  American seamen, which, he said were always given to blacks as well as  whites.) The war of 1812 was caused, continued Mr S., in no small degree, by  the impressment of our seamen who had these protections in their pockets. Our  government considered the impressment of blacks who had these protections, as  standing on the same ground with the impressment of the whites, and the war  was declared and fought as much on their account as on account of the whites.  The law in relation to American shipping required that in order to be entitled  to discriminating duties at the custom house, it must be owned in whole or in  part, by American Citizens. Colored persons frequently owned ships which were  uniformly regarded as the property of American citizens.</p><p>Mr S. named Paul Cuffee as an instance.</p><p>  The courts of the United States were open to citizens and also to  aliens—aliens, however, must describe themselves as such, on order to maintain  an action. The uniform practice was for blacs to sue as citizens, never as  aliens. Mr S. here read from Kent’s Com. and claimed from the doctrine there  advanced that a black might go from one State to another, and enjoy in that  other, the same privileges that a person of the same class enjoyed who  belonged to that other State, I do not claim, said Mr S., that a citizen of an  other State coming into this State, brings all privileges with him which he  before enjoyed—he brings with him however the character of a citizen of the  United States, and that entitles him to enjoy here, the same privileges with  our citizens under circumstances similar to his own.</p><p>  Gen. Jackson, said Mr S., in his proclamation at New Orleans, addressed the  blacks as “fellow citizens.” Did he mean to insult them? No, he meant to  recognize them as citizens and the law so recognized them. They could purchase  and hold real estate, could gain a settlement, and could, in fact, do what  citizen[s] could, and what aliens could not do. It would be an insult to talk  of naturalizing a man born here. The constitution of our State had been  alluded to, in order to prove that blacks were not citizens, because it did  not allow them to vote. Voting was not test of citizenship. If it was then by  the showing of the gentleman, blacks were citizens, for in New York they were  allowed to vote, and were therefore, according to the gentleman, citizens of  the United States in New York; of course they were citizens here.</p><p>  Mr Strong here replied to the arguments which had been drawn from the course  of legislation pursued by other States in respect to the blacks—the law of  Ohio, &amp;c. He read the law of Louisiana, which affixed a penalty of $500 or  the first offence of instruct[ing] a black in the Sabbath Schools, death for  the second. The jury, he said, were not to regard the laws of other States as  necessarily giving the true construction to the Constitution.—These laws, if  unconstitutional, did not support our law, and it was their province to decide  their constitutionality. He also referred to a late opinion of Judge Baldwin,  given in the Circuit Court of the United States, and also to the opinion of  Judge Washington before referred to, with respect to the rights of citizens of  the U. States in the several states.</p><p>  Our ancient law, said Mr. S., which allowed persons to be carried out of the  State, who were not citizens, was restrained from operating on apprentices,  because they came for the acquisition of knowledge.—While minors were  prevented from contracting for any thing but necessaries, they were allowed in  express terms, to contract for the purpose of education.—Was education, he  asked, a fundamental right? Ferdinand of Spain, he presumed did not believe  that it was, neither did that king who was now chased through Portugal—and  why? because education was the basis of liberty. Should such however be the  doctrine of this free land? If our law had said that blacks in this state  should not be educated at all, though inhuman and unchristian, it would not be  liable to the same objections that it now is. The case seemed to him as plain  as any he had ever submitted to a jury. The conclusion followed on the heel of  the premises. If a school was opened to blacks who belonged to this state, it  was certain it must be open to those who came from other states, under the  same circumstances, for by the Constitution of the United States, they were  entitled to a community of rights.</p><p>  As it regarded the license, which, under this law, might be obtained of the  select men and civil authority, ‘twas nothing at all—it would not be given,  but, if it would, we were not bound to ask it. As well might we be told that  we should not eat without their permission. That would merely starve the  body—this starved the mind—it kept on husks that which confer on man his  immortality.</p><p>  It was claimed that we had other laws of a similar character. ‘Twas no  matter—it made this law no better—doing wrong once was no apology for doing it  again, much less did it create a right to do it. Make the law equal as to its  application and he would find no fault.</p><p>  He took the case of Eliza Glasko—she was an inhabitant of the state, and Ann  Eliza Hammond was not. What difference could the Legislature make in relation  to these persons as to the right to attend what school they chose? As to the  law requiring citizens of other states to give bonds before they could  maintain an action in our Courts, it operated equally—citizens of our state,  if they resided out, were subject to the law—it depended simply on residence.  The law providing against the settlement of paupers would not sustain this  law. That required bonds for the support of those likely to become chargeable.  Bonds were not sought here, except the bonds which tie the mind, and fetter  the man—not bonds of security, but bonds of vassalage. It cannot, said Mr S.  be sustained. The people would not endure the alien law of ‘98—‘twas abhorrent  to the principles of our government, and drove from power the man that made  it. This law has features even more odious than that. The people will not and  ought not to endure it. By sanctioning this law, he said the jury would  sanction a principle which would prevent them or their sons from emigrating to  the western states.</p><p>  He trusted he need spend no more time—he believed they would do their duty. He  should ask the court to charge them that the law was obnoxious to the charges  he has made against it, but should the court do otherwise, his appeal was to  them. It was their prerogative to pass upon this law which owed its creation  to an excited state of feeling. To them he looked for a verdict which would  maintain civil liberty.</p><p>  Mr WELCH regretted the duty that had devolved upon him his state of health,*  and his recent connexion with the case, would, he said, perhaps prevent him  from doing to the case even that justice case which might have been in his  power to do under other circumstances. Besides the eloquence and ingenuity of  the defendant’s counsel might have diverted the mind of the jury from the real  issue. He should discharge his duty without personal feeling. If he had before  harbored any, he should strive to banish it from his mind now. He wished the  right of the state of Connecticut to be fairly, impartially, and  dispassionately examined. The government asked no conviction but upon  principles which could be consistently reconciled with justice and the  constitution. The fact that the defendant was a female had been alluded to,  but this altered not her rights. She had the same and none other rights, than  every citizen. Her hoped the jury would not be misled by the impassioned  flashes of eloquence which they had heard from her counsel. He would have them  pause and examine. The rights of the judge and the beggar were the same at the  bar of justice. Rights there, were common, but artificial rights in society  were different. The rights of citizens had been pressed upon their  attention—the rights of states must not be forgotten.</p><p>  Was the law Constitutional? Possibly it was not. Laws has been passed which  undoubtedly were unconstitutional, and if this was, he asked no conviction  under it. They had but one course to pursue. If the law was contrary to the  constitution they were bound to acquit—no one, if such was the character of  the law, would acquiesce in the decision more cheerfully than himself. The  gentlemen opposed to him has said, very emphatically, that they appealed to  the people if the court decided the law to be constitutional. The jury, he  said, were the people. It was no doubt true that in criminal cases the jury  could decide the in spite of the court, but, was it enviable? Would they  desire to do it? Rights were at stake, the rights of the state as well as the  rights of the party.—He would have the jury look&nbsp; at the result of their  verdict as it respected the effects it would have on these rights. They might  take the law into their own han ds and acquit the defendant. They sacrificed  the rights of the state beyond remedy by doing so—their verdict against the  state was final. If, however, they found a verdict against the defendant, it  had no such effect on her. The case could be carried to another tribunal where  she could have perfect justice, and where her rights would not be at all  prejudiced by a conviction here. ‘Twas no hardship to her, and a contrary  course might do an irremediable wrong to the state.</p><p>  They had been told that they had, that day, to decide a great question—an  exciting one. It was true. Why then had they been called so loudly to take the  case from the court? If they decided the law to be unconstitutional ‘twould be  no evidence except between the same parties as a matter of fact. Another jury  might decide the law to be constitutional, and this what was a crime at one  time would be no crime at another, though tried under the same law. He had no  idea that they had any motive but to discharge impartially their duties as  jurors.</p><p>  Mr W. said, that as the defendant, by her plea, had put all the facts  necessary to her conviction in issue, he should now examine the proof. The  counsel for the defence had seemed tacitly to admit the facts charged to be  true, but as he did not mean to desert any part of the case which the  gentlemen opposed to him had not distinctly admitted to be in favor of the  prosecution, he should recapitulate the evidence, and see if a case had been  made out. (Mr W. here examined the testimony, commented upon it at length, and  claimed that it was perfectly conclusive.)</p><p>  The gentlemen who had argued for the defence, said Mr W., never meant to make  the constitutionality of this law a point in the case. They thought they had  thrown a barrier around their client by closing the mouths of witnesses. It  was the object of the gentlemen to go out of court in triumph for want of  proof to convict, but the grating doors of a certain building, though it did  not unstop deaf ears, did open dumb mouths. The witnesses then spoke,  notwithstanding the gentlemen had hoped to apply to them the gag law. Their  efforts had proved ineffectual—their flag was furled, and when he saw the  quivering step of a retreating army he believed that they anticipated defeat.</p><p>  Mr W. rejoiced that a spirit was going abroad to improve the colored race.  ‘Twas one thing however to produce a reformation by proper and legal means and  another by improper and illegal ones. He would refrain no longer from  considering the constitutional question in the case. The law was called  unconstitutional because it was said to prohibit free persons of color from  coming into this state, from other states, to be educated. Mr W. said that he  knew no better way of testing constitutionality of a law, than a comparison of  the law with the provisions of the constitution. Whenever they came in  collision, it was easy to decide which must stand.—By this test then, by a  comparison of the letter of the law with the letter of the constitution, he  perceived no discrepancy. (Mr W. here read the second section of the fourth  article of the constitution and then read the law.) Now, continued Mr W. this  law does not prohibit any one from coming here for any purpose, if permission  be obtained. If it is on the prohibition that gentlemen claim the law to be  unconstitutional. But if permission be granted in all cases when asked, as  possibly it may be, where is the unconstitutionality of the law? The gentlemen  claim that it is prohibitory and therefore unconstitutional—it may never be  prohibitory; how then is it unconstitutional? In order, gentlemen, said Mr W.,  to determine that this law is unconstitutional, you must look through the  vista of coming time, and with a keen prophetic vision, foresee that the civil  authority will never grant their license. You must settle a question of face  which you cannot settle. If you can find this fact, put it in your  verdict—render this libel on your understandings along with it—such a  principle as this ought not to be contended for—the tears of contrition should  blot it out, and the blush of shame should light a fire to consume it.</p><p>  In respect to the meaning of the term “citizen” in the constitution, Mr. W.  claimed that the ground taken by Mr. Judson, in opening the case, was  tenable—that the term was used in a technical sense. He denied that it meant  all persons who lived and moved within certain limits, as he understood the  gentleman to claim. (Mr. W. here read from the articles of confederation, to  support his construction of the term “citizen.”) He said that his brother  Strong had read this quotation of a long trot, as though he feared the jury  would understand it, and perceive the fallacy of his argument. Mr W. claimed  that there was a distinction between the term “people” or “inhabitants,” in  the article of confederation, and the term “citizens” in the constitution. He  also read from Dr. Webster’s dictionary the definition of “citizen,” and  insisted that blacks do not come within it.—Mr. W. also read and commented on  the subject of naturalization, and claimed that Congress had never treated  blacks as capable of becoming citizens. It was not the policy of the  government. The Missouri question had been alluded to, but the whole of it was  one continued act of political juggling—he should not think of appealing to it  as authority for any thing.</p><p>  Mr. W. said that he derived a strong argument in construction which he gave  the constitution from the usages and legislation of other states. He then went  on to remark at length upon the statutes of many of the states, in relation to  the black population. If blacks were citizens he said the legislatures of many  of the states must be called worse than Turkish tyrants—He dwelt with much  emphasis and ability on the laws of Massachusetts and Rhode Island,  prohibiting the intermarriage of whites and blacks. These laws said Mr. W.,  could only be reconciled with the constitution on the ground that blacks were  not citizens. The right of education had been called a fundamental right. He  was not disposed to contest the truth of this position. The right of selecting  the partner of one’s joys and sorrows was however a right no less dear, no  less sacred, than the right of selecting those whom we will have to educate  our children. If our law was unconstitutional it was clear that all these laws  to which he had alluded were also unconstitutional. He did not believe they  were—the fact that they had been acquiesced I so long was evidence conclusive  to his mind that they were not.</p><p>  The case had been so fully gone into by his associate who opened the case,  that he would not detain the jury longer. He put the rights of the state into  their hands, and also the rights of the defendant, under direction of the  court as to the law. They were not to inquire whether their verdict would  advance the power of one party of another—whether it would feed or allay the  excitement which existed. They should forget all that did not legitimately  belong to the case—even the eloquence of the gentleman wo had argued for the  defence should be forgotten, so far as it was not relevant. Duties were  theirs—consequences devolved elsewhere.</p><p>His Honor Judge EATON then charged the jury in substance as follows.</p><p><em>Gentlemen of the Jury:</em></p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prudence  Crandall is charged in the information before you, with a violation of a  certain statute law of this state, forbidding the setting up of a school for  the instruction of colored persons, not inhabitants of this state, or boarding  or harboring them for the purpose of instruction. Provided the acts charged  are proved to be done, the day is not material, if since the passage of the  law, and before the filing of the information. Neither are the names nor the  number of the persons instructed material. The facts must be proved to your  satisfaction, gentlemen, and whether they are so or not you are the sole  judges—it is not the duty of the court even to advise in relation to the  measure of proof.</p><p>  As to the law of the case, this also belongs to you to decide, but the Court  has a duty to perform with regard to it. That duty is, to advise you as to its  validity and constitutionality. It has been claimed at the Bar that the law is  unconstitutional, and that the state legislature had no power to pass it. It  is gratifying to the court, gentlemen, that its opinion is not final—that it  can be revised by a higher tribunal, and corrected if erroneous. The opinion  of the Court is, that the law is constitutional and obligatory on the people  of this state.—You will take the case into consideration, gentlemen, and  render a verdict of guilty or not guilty, as to you shall seem just and  proper.</p><p>  The jury retired, and after an absence of several hours, returned into Court  not having agreed on a verdict. They were again ordered out, and again  returned not having agreed. The third time they stated to the court that there  was no probability that they should ever agree. The court then discharged  them. This operates as a continuance of the case to the next term of the  County Court to be holden on the second Tuesday of December  next.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  F.</p>","Scholarly Notes":"<p><br>  OK, a few interesting things – Welch seems to admit that the defense was<br>  eloquent, which might explain the strategic decision to rush the next trial<br>  for a time when there would be less eloquence available.

It is truly astonishing to witness the efforts at  misrepresentation in the last Advertiser respecting Miss Crandall’s trial.—It  is the part of wisdom in the many correspondents to that paper that they have  not signed their names to the articles communicated. An article appears headed  this, “Effects of abolition principles in a Court of Justice.” The writer  attempts, in his way, to question the veracity of persons who were called upon  to testify, when they said that they had drank tea with Miss Crandall and her  scholars but could not recollect the countenances of any who were then in  court. From this circumstance the writer wishes to convey the idea to his  readers that they were guilty of swearing falsely, and thus were it in his  power, would he fix upon them the seal of infamy. The writer of that article  should know, that however much honorable men may differ from him in sentiment,  merely a difference of opinion does not render them incapable of speaking the  truth, and whenever he touches upon an honorable man’s character, he touches a  very tender spot. However lightly he may regard it,—character, in the  estimation of some men—some abolitionists we trust—ay, even some who have had  the hardihood to  <em>sit at the same table</em>  with Miss Crandall and her colored misses—is above all price. The writer  thinks it is a most incredible circumstance that a person could drink tea with  20 misses whom he never saw before, and 2 or 3 months afterwards, when he  should see misses in a public assembly, could not recollect that they were the  persons with whom he drank tea. Perhaps they were present at the table, and  perhaps they were not. But suppose they were—would it be any thing strange for  a  <em>gentleman</em>  to sit down at table with 20 misses, half of them perhaps, sitting in a direct  line with himself, (so that it would be extremely difficult for him to see  them) and not seeing their countenances so as immediately to recollect them  when seen a number of weeks afterwards, with their bonnets on—in a different  attire—in a “court of Justice?” Surely these gentlemen—as they said they could  not recollect them—must be set down as liars, for no one can doubt—considering  the circumstances—that there was a  <em>reasonable possibility</em>  of their not knowing them at a glance—whether they were there or not. We would  advise the writer of that article to look up much reckless villains and have  them tried for perjury.</p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  JUSTICE.</p>","Scholarly Notes":null,"Commentary":null},{"pid":"obj94","identifier":"unionist--text-0094","title":"Letter to the Editor","bibliographicCitation":"<em>The Unionist</em> 1833-09-05","bibliographicCitation.republished":null,"fullIssueSequenceNumber":"1833-09-05 p03.20","creator":"\"Cato\"","_date.created":"1833-09-05","description":"Letter to the Editor from a Black male","language":"English","publisher":"The Unionist","IsPartOf":null,"rights":"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/","source":"The Unionist","subject":"Abolition; Black law","type":"Text","category":"Unionist full issue 1833-08-08","article.type":null,"volume":"1","issue":"6","transcription":"<p align=\"right\">FOR THE UNIONIST.</p><p>  “Philosophy, though eagle-eyed in nature’s tendencies” has not succeeded in  drawing a line of discrimination between the members of the human family, so  marked as to proscribe from the commonwealth of humanity those who Cowper says  are “guilty of a skin not colored like his own.” Indeed if my complexion does  afford proof that I am not so nobly born, not endowed with the same  unalienable privileges and rights as those of a different color, I declare  that I am not ambitious of attaining their prerogatives, by changing skins  with any of them—and much less do I repine at the decrees of Him who has made  of one blood all the nations of the earth.</p><p>  Though in the New-England States color is not deemed a sufficient offence to  consign the limbs of the tawny inhabitant to the shackle, and his back to the  scourge, yet the prejudices of the South are not wholly unfelt in the North;  although the fetter falls from the limb of the African, when his foot touches  the New England soil, still there lingers about the heart of a yankee some of  that bitterness and contempt towards his colored brethren, which forged  galling chains for that oppressed race.</p><p>  Many specious arguments have been advanced to prove the justness of African  Slavery, and although many honest men have met and refuted them, others have  allowed themselves to be wheedled into the comfortable idea, that they are  made of better clay, and entitled to more consideration, than their degraded  sufferers. Let me call upon  <em>you</em>  , who have still a small proportion of humanity left in your bosoms, to start  from the siren flaterers, who would lull you to repose, while thousand of your  fellow creatures groan beneath the lash of unfeeling tyrants, under the flag  of a nation professing to be guided by the law of Liberty, and Equal Rights!

From what must that  contentedness arise, which induces the slave to embrace the scourge and hub  the fetter. Would  <em>you</em>  be content to drudge for a master, and crouch at his feet like a dog? You say  “death before slavery,” and you would despise a white man who would submit to  the degradation of unlimited subordination. Because a wretch who is weary of  life requests you to shoot him, would you be justified in blowing his brains  out with a pistol?

At a time when France andEngland were yet involved in bigotry and superstition, Holland achieved forherself civil and religious freedom, and opened her bosom as an asylum for theoppressed Huguenots; while other, the pilgrim fathers sought a refuge frompersecution in the wilds of America. Holland for a long time took the lead ofall the surrounding nations in commerce, in science, in arts, and in arms.

It is unlikely that Burleigh had read it, as it contains support for the American Colonization Society, which he would not have endorsed.  In this 1833 book, Colton sees both the impracticality of the American Colonization Society's project, and the evil of slavery, but still thinks that the Colonization Society is a benevolent organization that is gradually raising consciousness around the issue of slavery.

She had been  bound over to answer to two complaints, one for teaching, and the other for  boarding colored persons from other states., but was tried on the former only.  A.T. Judson, Esq. and C.F. Cleaveland, the State’s Attorney, conducted the  prosecution, Henry Strong, Esq. and Hon. Calvin Goddard the defence. The plea  as on the former trial was  <em>not guilty.</em>  Several witnesses were examined, the facts necessary to conviction were  proved, and nothing remained but to establish the constitutionality of the  law.</p><p>  Mr. Judson opened the case for the prosecution and pursued much the same train  of argument as on the former trial, except that in addition to the points then  made, he contended that the clause in the constitution which was made the  ground of the defence, was intended as a rule of action to the general  government only, and not to the State Legislatures. He was followed by Mr.  Strong, who, in a powerful, logical and conclusive argument, clearly exhibited  the unconstitutionality of the law, showing that the Constitution  <em>was</em>  made to control the action of the state Legislatures; that it was intended to  secure to all citizens of the United States, the enjoyment of such privileges  and immunities as are fundamental; that the privilege of obtaining an  education is fundamental; and that free blacks are citizens, and of course  entitled, though citizens of other states, to the same privileges as our own  colored population, and among others to that of acquiring knowledge here. Mr.  Goddard closed for the defence, briefly but eloquently, and the State’s  Attorney having concluded on the part of the prosecution, the judge rose and  saying a few words respecting the importance of the question, and his  inability to do it justice, declined giving his charge till the next morning.</p><p>  On Friday morning as soon as the court was opened every seat was occupied and  many persons stood unable to obtain seats, all listening with profound  attention to the charge. It occupied as nearly as we could estimate, about an  hour, and as will be seen by the outline given below was decidedly in favor of  the constitutionality of the law.</p><p>  After stating to the Jury the charge on which Miss Crandall was brought before  them, His Honor Judge Daggett proceeded: “In relation to the facts there does  not appear to be much controversy—it is your province however to decide  whether they have been proved. It is also your province to decide as to the  law, the court cannot direct you as to either. But it is the duty of the court  to advise you in respect to the law.</p><p>  It is claimed that the law under which this prosecution is instituted, is  unconstitutional.&nbsp; If it be, it is because it violates the constitution  of the United States, for it is not violation of the constitution of  Connecticut. The question then is, Does this law violate the constitution of  the United States? If a law is clearly unconstitutional, it is the duty of the  humblest court in the land, even a justice of the peace, so to pronounce it,  for all judges, under which name are included jurors when acting as judges,  are bound by the constitution or laws in the respective states to the contrary  notwithstanding.</p><p>  In considering the question, “Is this law unconstitutional,” you will lay out  of consideration all extrinsic matter, slavery, and all its enormous evils;  the degradation of the blacks, and the utility and necessity of their being  educated, except so far as it is necessary to determine whether the privilege  of education is fundamental, of which I have no doubt.</p><p>There are two points to be considered.</p><p>  1  <sup>st</sup>  . The constitution secures to all citizens of the U.S. the privileges and  immunities of citizens in the several states. The construction of this section  <em>is not,</em>  as was contended at the bar, that it regulates only the action of the general  Government: it is operative as well upon the state Legislature as upon  Congress.</p><p>  2  <sup>nd</sup>  . Are the persons affected by this law, citizens of the United States. The law  prohibits colored persons from Havana coming here, as well as the blacks of  other states. With respect to the former, the right of exclusion is  unquestionable, for they are not citizens of the United States. Are the  colored inhabitants of this country citizens? It is the opinion of this court  that they are not. Are slaves citizens of the United States? The constitution  recognizes them only as the basis of representation and taxation. I refer to  the definition of the word citizen as given by Mr. Webster, the ablest  philologist of this or any country. (The judge here read the several  definitions of the word as given in Webster’s dictionary, the last of which,  and the only one applicable to the case is as follows—“In the United States, a  person, native or naturalized, who has the privilege of exercising the  elective franchise, and of purchasing and holding real estate.”) Slaves, then,  are not citizens, in any of the state constitutions. Are Indians citizens? It  is difficult to say what they are, but they are not citizens. Kent, in his  commentaries, speaks of them as distinct tribes, living under the protection  of the government,—2 Kent, 70. Are the free people of color citizens? I  answer, No. They are not so styled in the Constitution of the United States,  or, so far as I am aware, in the laws of Congress or of any of the states. In  that clause of the constitution which fixes the basis of representation, there  was an opportunity to have called them citizens if they were so considered.  But that makes free  <em>persons</em>  (adding three fifths of all other persons,) the basis of representation and  taxation..</p><p>  It has been said that free blacks own vessels which participate in the  peculiar privileges of American shipping. But this claim has never been  settled by judicial decisions. I know of no case where this question has been  settled. It is said also that blacks may sue in the U.S. Courts, but this too,  has never, within my knowledge been decided. It is claimed that they are  citizens because they may be guilty of treason, but so may any person who  resides under the government and enjoys its protection, if he rises up against  it.</p><p>  [His honor then read from Kent’s commentaries II, 210 a note in which the  commentator speaks of the degraded condition of the blacks and the  disabilities under which they labor, and thence inferred that in Kent’s  opinion they were not citizens.]</p><p>  Another reason for believing that people of color were not considered  citizens, is found in the fact that when the United States Constitution was  adopted every state except Massachusetts, tolerated slavery. The slave laws of  New-York were as severe as those of any state in the Union. In 1740 a slave in  that state was convicted by three justices and jury of five, and burnt at the  stake. God forbid that I should add to the degradation of this people, by  stating these things, but such is our condition.</p><p>  But if free blacks are citizens I am not prepared to say that the law is  <em>unconstitutional,</em>  though on this point I have more doubts than on the other. The constitution of  the United States did not profess to vest in the State Legislatures any new  powers, but to abridge those already possessed. I see not but the Legislature,  under their general power, might pass this law, I say nothing of its justice  or injustice, for I do not stand here to justify or abuse the legislature  which passed it. If the people disapprove the law, let them choose better men  to represent them who will repeal it. The privilege of acquiring an education  is certainly a fundamental privilege, but I am of opinion that the Legislature  may regulate it.</p><p>  The jury went out, and after an absence of 20 or 30 minutes returned with a  verdict of GUILTY.</p><p>  A bill of exceptions was filed by the defendant’s council, and the case will  be carried to the Supreme Court of Errors, which will sit here next July.”</p>","Scholarly Notes":null,"Commentary":null},{"pid":"obj142","identifier":"unionist--text-0142","title":"Case of Miss Crandall","bibliographicCitation":"<em>The Unionist</em> 1833-10-10 and <em>Vermont Chronicle</em> 1833-10-18, 8:42:2","bibliographicCitation.republished":"<em>Vermont Chronicle</em> 1833-10-18, 8:42:2","fullIssueSequenceNumber":null,"creator":null,"_date.created":"1833-10-10","description":"Brief excerpts from the Second Trial, and additional commentary on Black citizenship","language":"English","publisher":"<em>Vermont Chronicle</em> ","IsPartOf":null,"rights":"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/","source":"The Unionist","subject":"Black Law; Prudence Crandall; Canterbury Female Academy; African-American Students","type":"Text","category":"Unionist content","article.type":null,"volume":"1","issue":"11","transcription":"<p>  “In the Brooklyn Unionist, Oct. 10  <sup>th</sup>  , we find an account of a second trial of Miss Crandall before the Superior  Court of Connecticut, Judge Daggett on the bench.

The Judge instructed  the jury that free people of color are not citizens, and that the law of  Connecticut is, therefore, not unconstitutional.

A bill of  exceptions was filed and the case put over to the Supreme Court of Errors, to  be holden at Brooklyn next July.</p><p>  On this singular decision we remark that if the case be so that free colored  people are not citizens of the United States, their condition is far worse  than we had supposed. But we canot believe this, the arguments in the decision  notwithstanding; and we cannot account for it that such a decision comes from  Judge Daggett, except on the supposition that strong feeling, excited in his  native place (New Haven), by an attempt to erect a similar school there some  time ago, has biased his judgment.</p><p>Judge Daggett says</p><p>  ‘Are the colored inhabitants of this country citizens?

The  constitution does not so style free  <em>white</em>  persons, but does it not imply as much? Again, “I that clause which fixes the  basis of representation, there was an opportunity to have called them citizens  if they were so considered.” And so there was an opportunity to have called  free white people citizens. If the omission excludes the one from citizenship,  why not the other “But that (the constitution) makes free  <em>persons</em>  (adding three fifths of all other persons) the basis of representation and  taxation.” Now it seems to us that only two classes are here spoken of; first,  free persons, who, absolutely, form a basis, and next, slaves, only three  fifths of which form a basis. If then, the characteristic of forming a basis  for representation and taxation, entire, without division (five fifths of a  man and not three fifths) constitutes citizenship, by what logic is it  inferred that  <em>free</em>  colored persons are not citizens? The constitution it is true says nothing  about complexion, but does the omission therefore exclude free colored persons  If so can any one tell why it does not exclude free white persons?</p><p>  Judge Daggett says, “another reason for believing that people of color were  not considered citizens is found in the fact&nbsp; that when the United States  constitution was adopted, every state except Massachusetts, tolerated  slavery.” We are dull—we do not see how this related to the point in question.</p><p>  It was argued in the Court, that free blacks own vessels which participate in  the peculiar privileges of American shipping, and that blacks may sue in the  United States courts. This was overruled on the ground that those points had  never been settled by judicial decisions. We suppose it is true that free  colored people have owned vessels, and participated in the peculiar privileges  of American shipping ever since the constitution was formed, that they have  also had suits in the U.S. Courts, and that they have received protections as  American Citizens from British impressment. And it seems incredible that this  should have gone of 57 years, unquestioned, if they were not in reality  American citizens.</p><p>  What aid the definition of Webster gives to the decision we do not see. “In  the United States (a citizen is) a person, native or naturalized, who has the  privilege of exercising the elective franchise, and of purchasing and holding  real estate.” Now in seven states the persons in question have the right of  the elective franchise, and in all the right of purchasing and holding  realestate. Does not the definition then make against the decision rather than  for it?</p><p>  In this decision also Judge Daggett has gone in the face of very high opinion.  In the Convention of New York for amending the constitution, on the motion to  insert the wiord  <em>white</em>  before the words “  <em>male citizens,”</em>  in the article relating to the right of suffrage, Peter A. Jay said, “Is not  the right of suffrage a privilege? Can you deny it to a  <em>citizen</em>  of Pennsylvania, who comes here and complies with your laws, merely because he  is not six feet high, or because he is of a dark complexion?’ Chancellor Kent  said</p><p>  “Suppose a  <em>negro</em>  owning a freehold, and entitled to vote in Vermont, removes to this state, can  we constitutionally exclude him from the privilege of voting? The constitution  of the United States provides that  <em>citizens</em>  of each State shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of  citizens of the several States.”</p><p>Rufus King said</p><p>  ‘Take the fact that a  <em>citizen of color</em>  entitled to all the privileges of a citizen, comes here—he purchases a  freehold—can you deny him the rights of an elector incident to his freehold?  He is entitled to vote because like  <em>any other citizen</em>  he is a freeholder, and ever freeholder your laws entitle to vote.’</p><p>And again,</p><p>  “  <em>    As certainly as the children of any white men are citizen, so certainly the    children of black men are citizens.”  </em></p><p>Abram Van Vechten said,</p><p>  ‘There is another and to my mind an insuperable objection to the exclusion of  free citizens of color from the right of suffrage, arising from the provision  of the Constitution of the U.S. that the citizens of each State shall be  entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several  States.’</p><p>  In 1826 De Witt Clinton demanded of President Adams the release of ‘Gilbert  Horton a free man of color and a citizen of this state’ (New York) unlawfully  imprisoned in the District of Columbia, on the ground that he was ‘a free man  and a citizen.’</p><p>  Wes cannot believe with Judge Daggett that the whole free colored population  of our country is outlawed, that emancipation confers as privilege but that of  rambling about. And we hope there is a higher appeal yet than the Supreme  Court of blinded Connecticut before which this case may be tried. We believe  the people of Canterbury and their abettors are heaping up for themselves a  load of odium, which they will find it difficult to bear.”</p>","Scholarly Notes":null,"Commentary":"This appears to have content from William Jay's letter to Samuel May (see here) which arrived too late for the trial, but was likely included in 1:11 (October 17) issue of <em>The Unionist</em>."},{"pid":"obj143","identifier":"unionist--text-0143","title":"Domestic [Black Citizenship]","bibliographicCitation":"<em>The Unionist</em> 1833-10-17","bibliographicCitation.republished":"<em>New York Evangelist</em> 1833-10-19 <br><br>","fullIssueSequenceNumber":null,"creator":null,"_date.created":"1833-10-17","description":"Summary of Jay's arguments","language":"English","publisher":"<em>New York Evangelist</em> 1833-10-19 <br><br>","IsPartOf":null,"rights":"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/","source":"The Unionist","subject":"Black Law; Prudence Crandall; Canterbury Female Academy; African-American Students","type":"Text","category":"Unionist content","article.type":null,"volume":"1","issue":"12","transcription":"<p>  “Judge Daggett.—This respected magistrate, we perceive, was not compelled, as  we supposed, to sentence a Christian sister to an infamous punishment for the  crime of teaching other Christian sisters the knowledge by which they could be  qualified to do good to their class.

States. That instrument provides  that ‘Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all the privileges and  immunities of citizens in the several States.’ No longer ago than last  November, the Legislature of this State almost unanimously resolved that ‘If  the provisions contained in any proposed constitution of a new State, deny to  <em>any citizens</em>  of the existing States, the privileges and immunities of citizens of such new  State, that such proposed constitution should not be accepted or confirmed,  the same in the opinion of this Legislature being void by the Constitution of  the United States.’ Now Sir, is not the right of suffrage a privilege?

It is a compact to which the people of this in common with  those of other States are parties, and cannot recede from it, without the  consent of all. With this understanding, what let me ask, is the meaning of  the provision quoted by the gentleman from Albany (Mr. Kent.) Take the fact  that a  <em>citizen of color</em>  entitled to all the privileges of a citizen, comes here—he purchases a  freehold—can you deny him the rights of an elector incident to his freehold?  He is entitled to vote because like any  <em>other</em>  citizen he is a freeholder, and every freeholder your laws entitled to vote.  He comes here, he purchases property, he pays your taxes, conforms to your  laws—how can you then under the article of the constitution of the U. States  which has been read exclude him? The gentleman from N. York thinks that the  meaning of this provision in the U.S. Constitution extends only to civil  rights. Such is not the text, it is  <em>all</em>  rights. This seems to me to lay an insuperable barrier in our way.  <em>    As certainly as the children of any white men are citizens, so    certainly&nbsp; the children of black men are citizens.’—Speech of Rufus    King, p.  </em>  192.</p><p>  ‘It seems to me that some gentlemen entertain doubts whether any of our people  of color are in a legal sense citizens; but these doubts are unfounded. We are  precluded from denying their citizenship by our uniform recognition for more  than forty years—nay some of them were citizens when this State came into  political existence—partook in our struggle for freedom and independence, and  were incorporated into the body politic at its creation. There is another and  to my mind an insuperable objection to the exclusion of free citizens of color  from the right of suffrage, arising from the provision of the Constitution of  the U.S. that the citizens of each State shall be entitled to all the  privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States.’—  <em>Speech of Abraham Van Vechten, p.</em>  193.</p><p>Letter from De Witt Clinton, Governor of N.

From  whatever authority a law authorizing such proceedings may have emanated,  whether from the municipality of Washington, the Legislature of Maryland, or  the Congress of the United Sates, it is at least void and unconstitutional in  its application to a  <em>citizen,</em>  and could never have intended to extend further than to fugitive slaves.

This opinion, we are sure, will be viewed with  astonishment in many parts of the Union. In Massachusetts, the constitution  and laws have never deprived any man of any privilege on account of the color  of his skin.

To the charge of severity and injustice towards the characters of theleaders in this crusade, we reply—<em>Physician heal thyselfˆ–</em>clear your own eyes of motes and films before you proceed to pull out beams fromthe eyes of others. The whole vocabulary of abuse and contumely has beenexhausted by the abolitionists in their attempts to defame the motives andblacken the characters of the members of the Colonization society—so that now wescarcely see aught else in the columns of the Liberator and Emancipator, butnumerous repetitions of the same false and unfounded charges. Indeed, one wouldthink, from the matter contained in those papers, that their<em>sole</em>object is to destroy the Colonization society; as if that being accomplished,every thing else was easy. Now let the merits of abolitionism be ten times whatits warmest abettors assert, no reasonable objection can be made to theColonization Society whatever. It proposes to transport free blacks to Africawith their own consent, and if the blacks are willing to go, pray may not<em>free white</em>men give their money for the purpose without asking the consent of the Presidentof the Anti-Slavery Society? Where was the kindness and charity of Garrison, yeamore, where was his regard for moral probity, when he said that his object ingoing to England was to raise funds for the establishment of a manual laborschool—and now, since his return, he acknowledges that he was induced to thevoyage by a desire to represent (misrepresent he should have said) the objectand designs of the Colonization Society to the English. That he slandered hiscountrymen in London, there is abundant proof. Since he returned, he deniesit—so that no less than four falsehoods lie at his door, without the possibilityof any good accruing from either. How much was there “of the law of kindness aswell as of the requisitions of justice” in the latter which the patron of theUnionist wrote to some students, and which he requested might be published; whenhe said that he looked upon the Colonization Society<em>in no other light than an emissary of Satan</em>—whose only object is to perpetuate slavery?

Mr. Gurley and Mr. Finley?We do not ask these questions to justify ourselves if we have done wrong, butmerely to, let our “brother” see that it ill becomes him to throw stones. Tillhe &amp; his sect are free from sin they should be slow in condemning others. Asto what we asserted concerning the leaders in the abolition enterprize, we deemit strictly true. When they are told that the constitution forbids the freestates from meddling with property at the south, they reply in the language ofthe Apostle to the Jewish Ruler—we must obey God and not man—thus assertingtheir independence of the laws under which we live. If they respect the laws,why does not Miss Crandall dismiss her school? Till the decision of Judge Daggetis over ruled, that decision is the law of the land, which every honest citizenis bound to respect—and yet we see the Genius of Temperance, (the Editors ofwhich call themselves Christians par excellence) encouraging her to continue inopposition to a decree of one of the highest tribunals in the state. We find theabolitionists endeavoring to cast contempt upon the Colonization Society,because the latter speak of what is expedient to be done, in opposition to thedesigns of the&nbsp; former—and meeting in the&nbsp; writings of a gentleman oftalents and learning, a quotation about&nbsp; expediency being “a wrap-rascal,”they have rung the charges upon it, till it has fairly become stale, notforgetting in the excess of their charity to insinuate that whoever may doubt ofthe expediency of a measure, there can be no question as to the character whichsuch person&nbsp; should sustain in their own immaculate conceptions. Did theseover scrupulous gentlemen every hear or read of one who said that “all thingsare lawful for me, but all things are not expedient.” In the present state ofthe country immediate and unconditional abolition is neither<em>expedient</em>nor<em>lawful</em>—and those engaged in promoting it are only planting the seeds of sedition.

It is well known to those who  have perused the Liberator during the past year, from the facts given in the  2d No.,of the present volume, that a colored man of the name of Ray was  formerly a student in the Wesleyan University, and that he was under the  necessity of leaving it (the university) on account of the prejudices of  certain students. We are informed that the person who sent letters to the  Liberator, which he had received relative to Mr Ray’s leaving, incurred the  severest displeasure of those prejudiced students. It is probably known that  he was not then a member of the university. The excitement however soon passed  away, and in the course of a few months he entered the university. As the  subject of the above letter wished to pursue certain studies, instruction was  given him in that student’s room. Mr Beman recited three times each week, and  for a considerable time was unmolested other than by the reproachful terms of  a few base fellows as he passed to and fro from his recitation. His conduct  towards others was ever such as to merit a gentlemanlike deportment from them,  but this he did not receive. When those disaffected students found that  reproaches did not deter him from pursuing his course of recitations, they  resorted to other means. In going out from the university on a certain  morning, a quantity of water was thrown upon him, by which he was  <em>completely drenched.</em>  Some time in the course of the next day one of the party interested in the  affair caused a notice to be put up, calling a meeting of the students, that  evening, the spirit of which was such as to lead many to think it was written  by one not unfriendly to Mr Beman. This trick however was discovered, and  exposed at the meeting before mentioned. When the meeting was open ed, that  <em>very person</em>  who wrote the notice, and who, there is strong reason to believe, was  concerned in insulting Mr Beman, rose and  <em>    offered a resolution disapproving the conduct of those engaged in that    affair.  </em>  After the subject before the meeting had been with much warmth discussed, and  a request having been made that the student who then instructed Mr B. would  hear him recite at some other place, the meeting was dissolved. &nbsp;This  request, for the sake of producing harmony among the students, was, in form,  complied with, but owing to the subsequent advice of some friends, the  recitation went on as before, till the college vacation. Since the  Commencement, for the convenience of him who is instructing Mr B, the  recitation has not been heard in the university. All went on very well till  this letter was received, which has produced much excitement and unpleasant  feeling.

If we have been “unjust,” we are ready to make  amends—but the “severity” must in all probability be laid at the door of  truth, and the latter will take care of herself. All that we have to say is,  that we have not wittingly “misrepresented” any body. We have spoken of the  abolitionists with freedom, and shall do it again. Their designs are of a  character that do not require that we should be very mincing in our words, or  exceeding choice of our language. We mean, at all times, that it shall be  decent and respectful, for the sake of the public—but we are not aware of any  peculiar obligation that we are under to suit our phrases to the holiday  conceptions of those from whom we differ. We disclaimed, expressly, the  justice of retorting railing for tailing, and yet the Unionist suppresses the  disclaimer totally, and  <em>yet treats us as if we justified it.</em>  This is a specimen, we presume, of abolitionist propriety. The Unionist says—</p><p>  <strong>    “We do not wish the free states to ‘meddle with property at the south,” or    to interfere in any shape or form, with slavery at the south, except by    legal and constitutional methods. Our only meddling is such as almost all    the papers in the land have been guilty of, whenever they have denounced    Russian tyranny, or sympathized with Polish patriots suffering under    imperial despotism. In short the only medling of which we are, or wish to be    guilty, is the utterance of the truth, the exposure of the evils and guilt    of slavery, the asserting and proving that its abolition will be for the    good of all parties concerned, the petitioning Congress for its abolition in    those parts of the country which are under the exclusive jurisdiction of the    General Government.”  </strong></p><p>  Thus pray what is the use of your keeping up this constant agitation at the  North,  <em>where there are no slaves,</em>  and upon what grounds do you justify your opposition to, and wholesale abuse  of, the Colonization Society. If any person is to be enlightened, it is the  Southern planter. Why not go to the South and disperse your lucubrations—if  they are so very cogent, wise, and convincing? You are a citizen of the U.  States, and the Constitution guaranties the freedom of speech and of the  press. Go to the South, if your zeal is so abundant, your logic so good, and  be sure that your effusions will be read. If the above extract is the truth,  (and who shall gainsay it?) how does it condemn the leaders, (for the Unionist  is too modest to assume that title,) how does it, we say, condemn the conduct  of the leaders in this “crusade” against the Colonization Society, and the  Constitution. Such as the Unionist may be too timid to avow their real  designs—but that the leaders look forward to some modification, and if that  cannot be obtained, some infraction of the Constitution, few persons opposed  to them have much doubt. If this extract from the Unionist speaks the language  of the main body of the abolitionists, they must moderate their tone before  the public mind can be convinced. If the above is all they aim at, they are  laboring in a hopeless cause.”</p>","Scholarly Notes":null,"Commentary":"There is a paragraph in this excerpt that is actual Unionist content.

Let his sentiments be  contrasted with those to whom I have alluded. If as Archbishop Seeker has  asserted that “every death in battle is a murder,” the writer of this  introductory article verily believes that for the death of a Slave occasioned  by his servile condition the owner is responsible, and our country has  abundant and fearful reason to deprecate the solemn and awful denunciation  expressed in thsi (sic) sacred interrogatory—“Shall I not visit for these  things, saith the Lord? Shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as  this?” – HUMANITAS”</p><p>  “Mr. Speaker, Iniquitous and most dishonorable to Maryland is that dreary  system of partial bondage, which her laws have hitherto supported with a  solicitude worthy of a better object, and Citizens by their practice  countenanced. Founded in a disgraceful traffic, to which the parent country  lent her fostering aid, from motives of interest, but which even she would  have disdained to encourage, had England been the destined mart of such  inhuman merchandize; its continuance is as shameful as its origin.</p><p>  Eternal infamy await the abandoned miscreants whose selfish souls could ever  prompt them to rob unhappy Afric of her souls, and freight them hither by  thousands, to poison the fair Eden of liberty with the rank weed o individual  bondage. Nor is it more to the credit of our ancestors that they did not  command these savage spoilers to bear their hateful cargo to another shore,  where the shrine of freedom knew no votaries, and every purchaser would at  once be both a master and a slave.</p><p>  In the dawn of time, Mr. Speaker, when the rough feelings of barbarism had not  experienced the softening touches of refinement, such an unprincipled  prostration of the inherent rights of human nature, would have needed the  gloss of an apology: but to the everlasting reproach of Maryland, be it said,  that when her citizens rivalled the nation from whence they emigrated, in the  knowledge of moral principles, and an enthusiasm in the cause of general  freedom, they stooped to become the purchasers of their fellow creatures, and  to introduce an hereditary bondage into the bosom of their country, which  should widen with every successive generation.</p><p>  For my part, I would willingly draw the veil of oblivion over this disgusting  scene of iniquity, but that the present abject state of those who are  descended from these kidnapped sufferers, perpetually brings it forward to the  memory.</p><p>  But wherefore should we confine the edge of censure to our ancestors, or those  from whom they purchased? Are not we equally guilty?  <em>They</em>  strewed around the seeds of slavery;  <em>we</em>  cherish and sustain the growth.—  <em>They</em>  introduced the system;  <em>we</em>  enlarge, invigorate, and conform it.—Yes, let it be handed down to posterity,  that the people of Maryland, who could fly to arms with the promptitude of  Roman citizens, when the hand of oppression was lifted up against  themselves—who could behold their country desolated, and their citizens  slaughtered, who could brave with unshaken firmness, every calamity of war,  before they would submit to the smallest infringement of their rights—that  this very people could yet see thousands of their fellow creatures, within the  limits of their territory, bending beneath an unnatural yoke; and instead of  being assiduous to destroy their shackles, anxious to immortalize their  duration, so that a nation of slaves might for ever exist in a country where  freedom is its boast.</p><p>  “Even the very earth itself, (says some celebrated author) which teems with  profusion under the cultivating hand of the freeborn laborer, shrinks into  barrenness from the contaminating sweat of a slave.” This sentiment is not  more figuratively beautiful than substantially just.</p><p>  Survey the countries, sir, where the hand of freedom conducts the ploughshare  and compare their produce with yours.—Your granaries in this view appear like  the store houses of emmets [a colloquial word for “ant”], though not supplied  with equal industry. To trace the cause of this disparity between the fruits  of a freeman’s voluntary labors, animated by the hope of profit, and the  slow-paced efforts of a slave, who acts only from compulsion, who has no  incitement to exertion but fear—no prospect of remuneration to encourage—would  be insulting the understanding. The cause and the effect are too obvious to  escape observation.</p><p>  But it has been said (and who knows but the same opinion may still have its  advocates) “that nature has black balled these wretches out of society.”  Gracious God! can it be supposed that they Almighty Providence intended to  proscribe these victims of fraud and power, from the pale of society, because  thou hast denied them the delicacy of an European complexion? Is their color,  Mr. Speaker, the mark of Divine vengeance, or is it only the flimsy pretext  upon which we attempt to justify our treatment of them? Arrogant and  presumptuous is it this to make the dispensations of Providence subservient to  the purposes of iniquity, and every slight diversity in the works of nature  the apology for oppression. Thus acts the intemperate bigot in religion. He  persecutes every dissenter from his creed, in the name of God, and even rears  the horrid fabric of an inquisition upon heavenly foundations.</p><p>  I like not these holy arguments. They are as convenient for the tyrant as the  patriot—the enemy as the friend of mankind. Contemplate this subject through  the calm medium of philosophy, and then to know that these shackled wretches  are men as well as we are, spring from the same common parent, and endued with  equal faculties of mind and body, is to know enough to make us disdain to torn  casuists on their complexion to the destruction of their rights. The beauty of  complexion is mere matter of taste, and varies indifferent countries, nay,  even in the same; and shall we dare to set up this vague, indeterminate,  weathercock standard, as the criterion by which shall be decided on what  complexions the rights of human nature are conferred, and to what they are  denied by the great ordinances of the Deity? As if the Ruler of the Universe  had made the darkness of a skin, the flatness of a nose, or the wideness of a  mouth, which are only deformities or beauties as the undulating tribunal of  taste shall determine the indication of his wrath.</p><p>  Mr. Speaker, It is pitiable to reflect on the mistaken light in which this  unfortunate generation are viewed by the people in general. Hardly do they  deign to rank them in the order of beings above the mere animal that grazes  the field of its owner. That an humble, dusky, unlettered wretch that drags  the chain of bondage through the weary round of life, with no other privilege  but that of existing for another’s benefit should have been intended by heaven  for their equal they will not believe. But let me appeal to the intelligent  mind, and ask, in what respect they are our inferiors? Though they have never  been taught to tread the paths of science, or embellish human life by literary  acquirements; tho’ they cannot soar into the regions of taste and sentiment,  or explore the scenes of philosophical research, is it to be inferred that  they want the power, if the yoke of slavery did not check each aspiring effort  and clog the springs of action? Let the kind hand of an assiduous care mature  their powers, let the genius of freedom excite to manly thought and liberal  investigation, we should not then be found to monopolize the vigor of fancy,  the delicacy of taste, or the solidity of scientific endowments. Born with  hearts as susceptible of virtuous impressions as our own, and with minds as  capable of benefitting by improvement, they are in all respects our equals by  nature; and he who thinks otherwise has never reflected, that talents however  great may perish unnoticed and unknown, unless auspicious circumstances  conspire to draw them forth, and animate their exertions in the round of  knowledge. As well might you expect to see the bubbling fountain gush from the  burning sands of Arabia, as that the inspiration of genius or the enthusiastic  glow of sentiment should rouse the mind which has yielded its elasticity to  habitual subjection. Thus the ignorance and the vices of these wretches are  solely the result of situation, and therefore no evidence of their  inferiority. Like the flower whose culture has been neglected, and perishes  amidst permitted weeds ere it opens it blossom to the Spring, they only prove  the imbecility of human nature unassisted and oppressed.

The language is energetic, occasionally  severe, but we hold not ourself answerable for its severity. The circumstances  of the case justify it. Cruel charges, unsubstantiated by the least shadow of  evidence, have been too frequently brought against Abolitionists, and we have  a right to demand the proof or a retraction, and if neither is given, he who  makes those charge is, to say the least, a traducer of character.</p><p><em>For the Unionist.</em></p><p>To the Editor of the Norwich Courier</p><p>  SIR—I presume that you will agree with me in the sentiment that the editor of  a public journal is under weighty responsibilities, and should suffer nothing  to appear in the columns of his publication but with extreme caution. Opinions  disseminated through the columns of a newspaper will, to a greater or less  degree, influence the opinions of the reading community, and when the editor  of a paper advocates any particular doctrine, he doubtless desires that his  readers may adhere to the same doctrine. Great care therefore is necessary  that a person in your connexion with community should disseminate thro’ that  community, precepts which shall bear the test of truth—principles founded upon  the strictest rules of justice and sound morality. You sir, I presume,  professing to be governed by high and honorable motives, will readily assent  to this, and at all times be willing to turn your attention to any thing which  may have escaped your pen, and if any one of your readers should be so  unfortunate as to differ from you in sentiment, you will, I presume,  cheerfully examine the ground of their complaints, to be convinced, or to show  some reason for a different course.</p><p>  I would request of you, sir, to re-peruse an article which appeared under your  editorial head, Oct. 23d, in relation to Miss Crandall’s school and the  sentiments of the abolitionists. I would ask you to do it calmly and  dispassionately—  <em>searching for the truth</em>  —unbiassed by opinions previously expressed, farther than you find  <em>reason</em>  to be your supporter.</p><p>  You say, “Although we think that Miss Crandall has a right to continue her  school we are by no means friendly to the doctrines which are said to be  taught in it; yet these doctrines can never be put down by persecution—they  must be met by fair argument, and in such a contest they will prove wholly  untenable.” I am glad to find that you have never denied the  <em>right</em>  of Miss Crandall to teach such a school—it is rather a matter or surprise to  me, as it probably is to you, that New-England should contain an enlightened  man who  <em>would</em>  deny that right. I know not what doctrines you have heard to be taught in that  school, neither have you seen fit to inform the public. But you have said that  <em>dangerous</em>  doctrines are taught there that ought to be “put down.” If so, are not you,  sir, bound to tell us what these doctrines are, as you wish to enlighten the  public all you can—to overthrow these dangerous doctrines, and to free society  from their contamination, will you not condescend to meet them by “fair  argument,” as “in such a contest” you are confident “they will prove wholly  untenable?” I am anxious to see, what I have never yet seen and feat I never  shal, the attempt made to “put them down” by “fair argument,” instead of  addled eggs, &amp;c.</p><p>  You say again, “The least that can be said of the Abolition scheme is that it  is an  <em>insane</em>  project—one which no man in the full possession and exercise of his faculties  can contemplate as being practicable, or at the present time desirable.” I  know, sir, it is very easy for a person, especially when under a little  excitement, to go on and make severe accusations against his opponents, but it  is quite another thing to show the reason of these accusations. I might say  that the editor of the Norwich Courier was governed by passion and prejudice,  with as much ease as you charge Abolitionists of insanity; and I doubt not,  sir, that I should be able to substantiate my charge as soon as you yours. I  have seen similar charges in your paper before, but I have never known of your  being more particular. You are satisfied with making a general assertion, why  not specify wherein this insanity consists? The leading doctrine of the  Abolitionists is that no man has a right to hold his fellow man in bondage a  single moment. Is this insane? Is it untrue? Is it a fact that man  <em>has a right</em>  to rob his fellow man of liberty—of  <em>himself?</em>  If he  <em>has</em>  such a right, tell me, sir, who gave him that right, and how long it is to  continue. If he has a  <em>right</em>  to hold him in bondage  <em>one</em>  moment, how many moments may he have that right? But who are these insane  Abolitionists? How long since this spirit of insanity come upon them? They are  all around you—men of distinguished worth—of brilliant talents—to whom you,  sire, in your highest estimation of yourself, never considered yourself worthy  to be called an equal. You accuse them of forwarding a project which is not  desirable. Do you pronounce them all hypocrites? No, you dare not, but they  are  <em>insane,</em>  and therefore may be, for aught you know, sincere. But they are men of  exemplary piety—men of fervent prayer—of extensive influence in promoting the  cause of our Redeemer. You have not been accustomed to pronounce them  insane—even now you are ready to quote their opinions upon other subjects and  would place more confidence in their judgment than in your own. How happens it  that their insanity is confined to this subject alone?</p><p>  You say, “The agitators appear to have bid adieu to common sense and a regard  for the constitution and the laws,” &amp;c. I know not what you call bidding  adieu to common sense, but one thing I know, that the leading Abolitionists in  our country are the leading men in every other project to benefit the human  race—men distinguished for their moral courage, seeking for the approval of  God rather than for the favor of man. They have inquired for the path of duty  and having ascertained it they have not failed to run in that path. Some,  perhaps, might say that common sense in this respect is a disposition to act  in a manner most congenial with popular feeling, If this is your definition of  the term, I admit that they have ‘bid adieu to common sense,’ but as I  understand the term they have most strictly adhered to it.</p><p>  As for the charge of their disregarding the constitution and the laws, I think  it a very grave accusation to be brought against many of the best men of our  country. But you, sir, are not the only one who has seen fit to make  it—neither are you the only one who has made it without specifying what part  of the constitution or what laws they disregard—and I must tell you, sire,  that neither you nor all the wholesale accusers who you join  <em>can</em>  point out a single line of our constitution from which Abolitionists, as such,  have departed. “Bid adieu to a regard for the constitution!” It is not  true—and I here call upon you, sir, to clear your character from the  imputation of falsehood. I would not say, sir, that you  <em>intended</em>  to assert an untruth, but I  <em>do</em>  say that you  <em>have</em>  asserted one, and unless you retract or substantiate it, the charge of  falsehood must rest upon you. Is it unconstitutional to assert that it is  morally wrong to hold slaves? Does the constitution of a free, republican  people forbid that we should  <em>speak against</em>  chaining the mortal body and degrading the immortal mind? Is it against the  constitution of a Christian people to declaim against the cruel system of  slavery? —to say that it is contrary to the righteous laws of God—that it is  inconsistent with the spirit of the gospel and the precepts of our Savior? Is  it a fact that the  <em>republicans</em>  of the United States hold one sixth of their number in the chains of the  verist despotism—that  <em>two millions</em>  of our fellow creatures are groaning under worse than Egyptian servitude—that  <em>two million</em>  of immortal souls are shut out from the light of science and closed to the  entrance of one cheering ray from the Sun of Righteousness—and that when a few  fearless men stand forth and say that these things are  <em>wrong,</em>  you, the editor of a public journal, cry out that in so saying they have “bid  adieu to a regard for the constitution?” Tell me, sir, if these things are  facts? O that you could tell me that they were not facts! But, alas! they are.  We must not say that it is  <em>wrong</em>  to degrade the image of God to a level with the brutes that perish, for it is  unconstitutional. Thank God!&nbsp; we have no such constitution as this! Shame  on my countrymen! Shame on any republican asserting such a doctrine! I know  the constitution  <em>permits</em>  the several states to hold slaves if they choose—but no where does it say that  we  <em>shall not</em>  raise our voices against this abominable system. Wherein, then, have  Abolitionists “bid adieu to a regard for the constitution?” Will you, sir,  point out this treason, or cease longer to make an unfounded accusation?</p><p>  You say, “That this unprincipled opposition to the labors of the Colonization  Society will raise up many warm friends to the latter there is abundant ground  to hope.” As “unprincipled,: sir, as these ‘agitators’ may be, I deem it no  disparagement to you to say that they are mi int eh splendor of whose moral  qualities you would be hardly visible, and whose names will be breathed with  veneration by the virtuous and the good when yours shall have long been  forgotten. But I am perfectly willing that you should, if you can, console  yourself that by this opposition many warm friends will be raised up to the  Colonization Society, but perhaps it may soften future disappointment, to  inform you that many of those who have been :warm friends” to that society are  flocking around the Abolition standard, and however many ‘warm friends’ the  Colonization Society may have, the cause of Abolition must forever stand. AS  long as justice reigns in heaven and sin is found on earth, so long will those  be found who will exert themselves to hasten the triumph of the former and  crush and extirpate the latter, and as sure as God is good so sure will he  cause them to prosper.</p><p>  Again you say, “If the blacks are to be benefitted at all, it can only be  accomplished by the aid of the Colonization Society, and their removal to  Africa.” O that you had spared the penning of that sentence! What principle do  you mean to advocate? Into what would you convert our happy land? What, sir,  shall we think of the man, professing to be governed by that religion which  commands us to love our neighbor as ourselves, who tells us that here are two  and a half millions of immortal beings among us, degraded and wretched, and if  they “are to be benefitted at all” it must be by “their removal to Africa?”  What, in the name of God, is the reason they cannot be benefitted here? What  but that you and some of your brother editors are so wickedly prejudiced  against them that you are determined they  <em>shall not be?</em>  They  <em>can</em>  be benefitted here—they  <em>will</em>  be benefitted here. The number of blacks in this country will never be less  than at the present moment—for in the first place we have not the means to  make them less, increasing as they do 70,000 per year, and in the second place  if we had the means of carrying them to Africa they do not want to go. They  must always remain with us unless we serve them as we have served the poor  Indians, and though you may continue to assert that they must always remain  degraded, yet ever true Christian will rejoice that God in his good providence  has ordered it otherwise.</p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  JUSTICE.</p>","Scholarly Notes":null,"Commentary":null},{"pid":"obj159","identifier":"unionist--text-0159","title":"Declaration of the National Anti-Slavery Society","bibliographicCitation":"<em>The Unionist</em> 1833-12-19","bibliographicCitation.republished":"<em>The Abolitionist</em><br>1:12:178-180 (December 1833)<br>","fullIssueSequenceNumber":"1833-12-19 p.01.05","creator":null,"_date.created":"1833-12-19","description":"Declaration, and some parts of the deliberations, from the founding meeting of the American Anti-Slavery Society in December 1833","language":"English","publisher":"The Unionist","IsPartOf":null,"rights":"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/","source":"The Unionist","subject":"Abolition; National News","type":"Text","category":"Unionist full issue 1833-08-08","article.type":null,"volume":"1","issue":"20","transcription":"<p>DECLARATION OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY CONVENTION.</p><p>  The Convention, assembled in the City of Philadelphia to organize a National  Anti-Slavery Society, promptly seize the opportunity to promulgate the  following DECLARATION OF SENTIMENTS, as cherished by them in relation to the  enslavement of one-sixth portion of the American people.</p><p>  More than fifty-seven years have elapsed since a band of patriots convened in  this place, to devise measures for the deliverance of this country from a  foreign yoke. The corner-stone upon which they founded the TEMPLE OF FREEDOM  was broadly this—“that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by  their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life,  LIBERTY, and the pursuit of happiness.” At the sound of their trumpet-call,  three millions of people rose up as from the sleep of death, and rushed to the  strife of blood; deeming it more glorious to die instantly as freemen, than  desirable to live one hour as slaves.—They were few in number—poor in  resources; but the honest conviction that Truth and Justice, were on their  side, made them invincible.</p><p>  We have met together for the achievement of an enterprise, without which, that  of our fathers is incomplete, and which, for its magnitude, solemnity, and  probable results upon the destiny of the world, as far transcends theirs, as  moral truth does physical force.</p><p>  In purity of motive, in earnestness of zeal, in decision of purpose, in  intrepidity of action, in stead fastness of faith, in sincerity of spirit, we  would not be inferior to them.</p><p>  <em>Their</em>  principles led them to wage war against their oppressors, and to spill human  blood like water, in order to be free.  <em>Ours</em>  forbid the doing of evil that good may come, and lead us to reject, the use of  all carnal weapons for deliverance from bondage—relying solely upon those  which are spiritual, and mighty through God to the pulling down of strong  holds.</p><p>  <em>Their</em>  measures were physical resistance—the marshalling in arms—the hostile  array—the mortal encounter.  <em>Ours</em>  shall be such only as the opposition of moral purity to moral corruption—the  destruction of error by the potency of truth—the overthrow of prejudice by the  power of love—and the abolition of slavery by the spirit of repentance.</p><p>  <em>Their</em>  grievances, great as they were, were trifling in comparison with the wrongs  and sufferings of those for whom we plead. Our fathers were never slaves—never  bought and sold like cattle—never shut out from the light of knowledge and  religion—never subjected to the lash of brutal taskmasters.</p><p>  But those, for whose emancipation we are striving, —constituting at the  present time at least one-sixth part of our countrymen, are recognized by the  laws, and treated by their fellow beings, as marketable commodities—as goods  and chattels—as brute beasts—are plundered daily of the fruits of their toil  without redress;—really enjoy no constitutional nor legal protection from  licentious and murderous outrages upon their persons;—are ruthlessly torn  asunder—the tender babe from the arms of its frantic mother—the heart-broken  wife from her weeping husband—at the caprice or pleasure of irresponsible  tyrants;—and, for the crime of having a dark complexion, suffer the pangs of  hunger, the infliction of stripes, and the ignominy of brutal servitude. They  are kept in heathenish darkness by laws expressly enacted to make their  instruction a criminal offence.</p><p>  These are the prominent circumstances in the condition of more than TWO  MILLIONS of our people, proof of which may be found in thousands of  indisputable facts, and in the laws of the slaveholding States.</p><p>Hence we maintain—</p><p>  That in view of the civil and religious privileges of this nation, the guilt  of its oppression is unequalled by any other on the face of the earth;—and,  therefore,</p><p>  That it is bound to repent instantly, to undo the heavy burden, to break every  yoke, and let the oppressed go free.</p><p>We farther maintain—</p><p>  That no man has a right to enslave or imbrute his brother—to hold or  acknowledge him, for one moment, as a piece of merchandise—to keep back his  hire by fraud—or to brutalize his mind by denying him the means of  intellectual, social and moral improvement.</p><p>  The right to enjoy liberty is inalienable. To invade it, is to usurp the  prerogative of Jehovah. Every man has a right to his own body—to the products  of his own labor—to the protection of law—and to the common advantages of  society. It is piracy to buy or steal a native African and subject him to  servitude. Surely the sin is as great to enslave an American as an African.</p><p>Therefore we believe and affirm—</p><p>  That there is no difference,  <em>in principle,</em>  between the African slave trade and American slavery;</p><p>  That every American citizen, who retains a human being in involuntary bondage,  is [according to Scripture] a MAN-STEALER;</p><p>  That the slaves ought instantly to be set free, and brought under the  protection of law;</p><p>  That if they had lived from the time of Pharaoh down to the present period,  and had been entailed through successive generations, their right to be free  could never have been alienated, but their claims would have constantly risen  in solemnity;</p><p>  That all those laws which are not in force, admitting the right of slavery,  are therefore before God utterly null and void, being an audacious usurpation  of the Divine prerogative, a daring infringement on the law of nature, a base  overthrow of the very foundations of the social compact, a complete extinction  of all the relations, endearments and obligations of mankind, and a  presumptuous transgression of all the holy commandments—and that therefore  they ought to be instantly abrogated.</p><p>We further believe and affirm—</p><p>  That all persons of color who possess the qualifications which are demanded of  others, ought to be admitted forthwith to the enjoyment of the same  privileges, and the exercise of the same prerogatives, as others; and that the  paths of preferment, of wealth. and of intelligence, shall be opened as widely  to them as to persons of a white complexion.</p><p>  We maintain that no compensation should be given to the planters emancipating  their slaves—</p><p>  Because it would be a surrender of the great fundamental principle that man  cannot hold property in man;</p><p>  Because  <em>Slavery is a crime, and therefore is not an article to be sold;</em></p><p>  Because the holders of slaves are not the just proprietors of what they claim;  freeing the slaves is not depriving them of property, but restoring it to the  right owner; —it is not wronging the master, but righting the slave—restoring  him to himself;</p><p>  Because immediate and general emancipation would only destroy nominal, not  real property it would not amputate a limb or break a bone of the slaves, but  by infusing motives into their breasts, would make them doubly valuable to the  masters as free laborers; and</p><p>  Because if compensation is to be given at all, it should be given to the  outraged and guiltless slaves, and not to those who have plundered and abused  them.</p><p>  We regard, as delusive, cruel and dangerous, any scheme of expatriation which  pretends to aid, either directly or indirectly, in the emancipation of the  slaves, or to be a substitute for the immediate and total abolition of  slavery.</p><p>  We fully and unanimously recognize the sovereignty of each State, to legislate  exclusively on the subject of the slavery which is tolerated within its  limits. We concede that Congress, under the present national compact, has no  right to interfere with any of the slave states, in relation to this momentous  subject.</p><p>  But we maintain that Congress has a right, and is solemnly bound, to suppress  the domestic slave trade between the several States, and to abolish slavery in  those portions of our territory which the Constitution has placed under its  exclusive jurisdiction.</p><p>  We also maintain that there are, at the present time, the highest obligations  resting upon the people of the free States, to remove slavery by moral and  political action, as prescribed in the Constitution of United States. They are  now living under a pledge of their tremendous physical force to fasten the  galling fetters of tyranny upon the limbs of millions in the southern  States;—they are liable to be called at any moment to suppress a general  insurrection of the slaves;—they authorize the slave owner to vote for  three-fifths of his slaves as property, and thus enable him to perpetuate his  oppression;—they support a standing army at the south for its protection;—and  they seize the slave who has escaped into their territories, and send him back  to be tortured by an enraged master or a brutal driver.</p><p>  This relation to slavery is criminal and full of danger:  <em>it must be broken up.</em></p><p>  These are our views and principles—these, our designs and measures. With  entire confidence in the overruling justice of God, we plant ourselves upon  the Declaration of our Independence, and upon the truth of Divine Revelation,  as upon the Everlasting Rock.</p><p>  We shall organize Anti-Slavery Societies, if possible, in every city, town and  village of our land.</p><p>  We shall send forth Agents to lift up the voice of remonstrance, of warning of  entreaty and rebuke.</p><p>  We shall circulate, unsparingly and extensively, anti slavery tracts and  periodicals.</p><p>  We shall enlist the Pulpit and the Press in the cause of the suffering and the  dumb.</p><p>  We shall aim at a purification of the churches from all participation in the  guilt of slavery.</p><p>  We shall encourage the labor of freemen over that of the slaves, by giving a  preference to their productions;—and</p><p>  We shall spare no exertions nor means to bring the whole nation to speedy  repentance.</p><p>  Our trust for victory is solely in GOD.  <em>We</em>  may be personally defeated, but our principles never. TRUTH, JUSTICE, and  HUMANITY, must and will gloriously triumph. Already a host is coming up to the  help of the Lord against the mighty, and the prospect before us is full of  encouragement.</p><p>  Submitting this DECLARATION to the candid examination of the people of this  country, and of the friends of liberty all over the world, we hereby affix our  signatures to it; pledging ourselves that, under the guidance and by the help  of Almighty God, we will do all that in us lies, consistently with this  Declaration of our principles, to overthrow the most execrable system of  slavery that has ever been witnessed upon earth—to deliver our land from its  deadliest curse—to wipe out the foulest stain which rests upon our national  escutcheon—and to secure to the colored population of the United States all  the rights and privileges which belong to them as men and as Americans—come  what may to our persons, our interests, or our reputations—whether we live to  witness the triumph of Justice, Liberty and Humanity, or perish untimely as  martyrs in this great, benevolent, and holy cause.</p><p>  David  Thurston,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  B.

He believed that it had always been customary for the  House to adopt suitable tributes of respect to its deceased members. The S.C.  delegation had heard, with deep regret, of the death of their colleague, the  Hon. Thomas D. Singleton, and it was his painful duty to communicate that  mournful information to the House. He died at Raleigh, whilst on his journey  to the Capitol, whither he was hastening to assume his seat, and to discharge  his duties, as a member of this body. ****</p><p>  With these few remarks, which he had felt it his duty to submit, in justice t  the character of one whose memory deserved a far better tribute than any he  could offer, he now proposed the following resolutions for the consideration  of the House;</p><p>  Resolved, That we have received, with deep regret, the melancholy intelligence  of the death of the Hon. THO’S D. SINGLETON, a Representative elect from the  State of South Carolina.</p><p>  Resolved, That this House tender the expression of their sympathy to the  relatives of the deceased, upon this mournful event; and that, in testimony of  their regret for the loss, and respect for his memory, the members will wear  crape upon the left arm for thirty days.</p><p>The House then adjourned.</p><p>IN SENATE</p><p>THURSDAY, December 12.</p><p>  A Message from the President was received by the hands of Mr Donalson [blurry  copy, not sure if correct], his Private Secretary, which was read as follows:</p><p>  I have attentively considered the resolution of the Senate of the 11th  instant, requesting the President of the United States to communicate to the  Senate \"a copy of the paper which has been published, and which purports to  have been read by him to the heads of the Executive Departments, dated the  18th day of September last, relating to the removal of the deposits of the  public money from the Bank of the United States and its offices.\"  <br />  The executive is a co-ordinate and independent branch of the Government  equally with the Senate, and I have yet to learn under what constitutional  authority that branch of the Legislature has a right to require of me an  account of any communication, either verbally or in writing, made to the heads  of Departments acting as a Cabinet council. As well might I be required to  detail to the Senate the free and private conversations I have held with those  officers on any subject relating to their duties and my own.  <br />  Feeling my responsibility to the American people, I am willing upon all  occasions to explain to them the grounds of my conduct, and I am willing upon  all proper occasions to give to either branch of the Legislature any  information in my possession that can be useful in the execution of the  appropriate duties confided to them.  <br />  Knowing the constitutional rights of the Senate, I shall be the last man under  any circumstances to interfere with them. Knowing those of the Executive, I  shall at all times endeavor to maintain them agreeably to the provisions of  the Constitution and the solemn oath I have taken to support and defend it.  <br />  I am constrained, therefore, by a proper sense of my own self-respect and of  the rights secured by the Constitution to the executive branch of the  Government to decline a compliance with your request. ANDREW JACKSON</p><p>After the message had been read,</p><p>  Mr Clay said, that a call had been made on the President for a copy of a  document which has been published and extensively circulated by the papers in  this city—a document intimately connected with the safety of the treasure of  the country. The call for it was made under the ull conviction that the Senate  ought to have that document. It had been refused, under the pretext that the  rights of the Chief Magistrate were invaded by it. He always would be disposed  to respect the rights of every public officer, but the President could have no  more confidence in his rights, then I feel in the rights of the Senate. The  right o the Senate to call for this paper was founded on the ground that the  whole world was already in possession of it. It was made because the document  was sent forth to the American people upon an all-important subject, and  because it was the right of the Senate to have it. Nor was it made because the  call was in violation of precedent or an established usage. But the President  has refused to give us this document, and it was not necessary to proceed  further in the pursuit. One result happens from it. The President don’t deny  the genuineness o the paper. It is before the world, and as we have endeavored  to get it, and it has been refused, I have a right to take the next best  evidence of the document, and that is as it has been published in the official  paper. In every instance, therefore, where I have occasion to use it, I shall  avail myself of that publication of it, as genuine.</p><p>  Mr Grundy said he thought when the proposition was made, that it was a very  unnecessary procedure.</p><p>  Here the presiding office interposed that the debate was out of order unless  some motion was intended to be made.</p><p>  Mr Grundy said he intended to love, before he concluded, that the message be  laid on the table; and then resumed—</p><p>  That he thought it unnecessary, because we only wanted evidence when facts had  not come to our knowledge, or when they are denied.—Now, he believed that both  friends and enemies admitted this document to be genuine—to be what it  purported to be. He therefore had thought that nothing beneficial could result  from this proposition, and this was what induced him to vote against it. The  President has given his objection to complying with the call, and what is it?  Why, that the Senate has asked for a private communication from the Chief  Magistrate to his Cabinet. He, [Mr. G.} would never question the propriety of  the motives of the Senator who wanted this information. But the President has.  <em>Note: Clay was a former nominee for the office of the President</em></p><p align=\"center\">IN SENATE.</p><p align=\"right\">WEDNESDAY, December 11, 1833.</p><p>  Mr Bibb, pursuant to notice given, presented certain joint resolutions  providing or an alteration in the Constitution of the United States, in  relation to the mode of electing the President, and Vice President, and then  moved to lay the same on the table and print them. Mr. B. said he felt no  disposition to press the consideration of the resolutions now, and therefore  moved that the second Monday in January next be assigned for taking them up,  and also the resolutions offered by Mr. Benton somedays since, on the same  subject, at the same time; which was agreed to.</p><p>  Mr Clay moved the consideration of Mr Benton’s resolution, relative to the  amount of moneys in deposite [sic] at particular periods in the Bank of the  United States.</p><p><em>Apparently a line is missing here</em></p><p>  Said that it is a matter which you have no regiht to interrogate him about;  and his opinion is, too, that to comply with the request would be setting a  dangerous precedent. He [Mr G.] was not inclined to sat any thing on the  subject of the removal of the deposits, when that matter should come up for  consideration. But if he did, he could not, even if he were so disposed, speak  of that paper as any other than a genuine one, or deny its authenticity. He  therefore moved to key the message on the table; which was agreed to.</p><p align=\"center\">HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</p><p align=\"right\">Friday, Dec, 13, 1833</p><p>  The Speaker presented to the House a memorial from Messrs.

In  order to render the work extensively useful, a large circulation was  necessary, and to ensure this, a very low price was indispensable.</p><p>  Every effort has been made to combine all these points in the Magazine, and we  are happy to say that the success of our experiment thus far, is very  encouraging. The circulation at present is nearly 15,000; a number entirely  beyond that of any similar work ever undertaken in this country. But great as  it is, such are the accumulated expenses of the publication, from the number  of engravings, and from the care attending it, together with the very low  price at which it is afforded, that we need a still more extended circulation  to enable us fully to develope [sic] our plan, and bring into activity all the  means of rendering the work still more efficient and useful.</p><p>  The idea of a state of society in which there shall not be an individual,  either so ignorant, or so depraved, through the faults of education, as to be  blind to his interests, and resist the great end of life, is perhaps a mere  chimera, but if it is a point that cannot be reached, it may certainly be  approached. But how is this to be done? By an union of heart and hand, among  the good and wise, in giving the fullest possible activity and energy, to  every instrument which leads to the desired end.</p><p>  Now, if in your opinion, this work is such an instrument, we suggest, as a  means by which you may promote its usefulness, some further recommendation of  it to the public attention, and in particular to that of teachers of  [indecipherable – students? scholars?] and heads of families.

This poem can also be found on Poem Hunter: https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/to-the-memory-of-charles-b-storrs/ . In addition to the poetic memorial from Whittier, there is this account from Henry Wilson of Storrs' deathbed testimony: \"Rev. Amos A. Phelps of Massachusetts earnestly supported the resolution. He referred in words of tender eulogy to the Rev. Charles B. Storrs, late president of the Western Reserve College, who had recently died at Braintree, Massachusetts. He stated that Mr. Storrs, while lying on his death-bed, requested that a pen should be placed in his hands, that he might affix his name to a declaration of antislavery principles about to be issued. \"He commenced,\" said Mr. Phelps, “tracing his name, and had written the first word, 'Charles,' when he discovered that two of the letters had been transposed. Letting the pen fall, and turning to his brother, standing by, he exclaimed, with an energy peculiar to him: 'I can write no more: Brother, do you finish my name. Those principles are eternal truth. They cannot be shaken. I wish to give to them my dying testimony.'\" Mr. Phelps expressed the opinion that the death of President Storrs had been hastened by over-exertion in delivering an address of great vigor and power of more than two hours in length, in behalf of the slave. Mr. Storrs was a gentleman of high promise and scholarship, of Christian principle and earnest philanthropy, in whose untimely death freedom lost one of its earliest and ablest champions. The touching scene at his death-bed is one among the evidences that the antislavery struggle in this country was born of a zeal and heroic devotion to principle which finds not many parallels in the world's history\" (“National Antislavery Convention at Philadelphia: Organization of the American Antislavery Society,” by Henry Wilson, in <em>History of the Rise and Fall of the Slave Power in America</em>, 1872, accessed http://www.americanabolitionists.com/american-anti-slavery-society.html"},{"pid":"obj207","identifier":"unionist--text-0207","title":"On Visiting Niagara","bibliographicCitation":"<em>The Unionist</em> 1833-12-19","bibliographicCitation.republished":"<em>Constitutionalist</em>","fullIssueSequenceNumber":"1833-12-19 p.04.53","creator":null,"_date.created":"1833-12-19","description":"Poem about awe-inspiring nature","language":"English","publisher":"The Unionist","IsPartOf":null,"rights":"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/","source":"The Unionist","subject":"Poetry; Nature","type":"Text","category":"Unionist full issue 1833-08-08","article.type":null,"volume":"1","issue":"20","transcription":"<p align=\"center\">ON VISITING NIAGARA</p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The awful  grandeur of that view</p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Burst on my feeble senses then,</p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With  whelming violence, and drew</p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The soul’s deep feeling out; as when</p><p>The hour of death draws nigh, we call</p><p>On Him who holds life’s issues all—</p><p>And lift our hearts up to the throne</p><p>Of Him the High, Eternal One;</p><p>As on the brink of that bursting stream</p><p>My soul went forth to the Great Supreme:—</p><p>“Almighty God!

Laws which authorize the licensing of men to traffic in ardent spirit,  violate the first principles of political economy, and are highly injurious to  the wealth of a nation.</p><p>  The wealth of a nation consists of the wealth of all the individuals that  compose it. The sources of wealth are labor, land, and capital. The last is  indeed the product of the two former; but as it may be used to increase their  value, it is considered by writers on political economy, as one of the  original sources of national wealth. Whatever lessons either of these, or  their productiveness when employed upon each other, lessens the wealth of the  country. Capital may be employed in two ways; either to produce new capital,  or merely to afford gratification, and in the production of that gratification  he consumed, without repealing its value. The first may be called capital, and  the last expenditure. These will of course bear inverse proportions to each  other. If the first be large, the last must be small, and vice versa. Without  any change of the amount of wealth, capital will be increased by the lessened  by the increase of expenditure. Although the manner of dividing makes no  difference with the present amount of national wealth, it makes great  difference with the future amount; as it alters materially the sources of  producing it, the means of an equal, or increased reproduction.</p><p>  For instance, a man fond of noise and excited agreeably by the hearing of it,  pays a dollar for gunpowder, and touches fire to it. He occasions an entire  loss of that amount of property. Although the powder maker and the merchant,  may both have received their pay, if it has not benefitted the man, to him it  has been a total loss; and if the sale of it was more profitable than would  have been the sale of some useful article, it has been an entire loss to the  community. And if by the explosion the man is burnt, partially loses his  reason, is taken off a time from business, and confined by sickness to his  bed, must have nurses, physicians, &amp;c. the loss is still increased. And if  he never recovers fully his health, or reason, suffers his social affections  and moral sensibility, becomes less faithful in the education of his children,  and they are more exposed to temptation and ruin, and he is never again as  able or willing to be habitually employed in productive labor, the nation  loses equal to the amount of all these put together. And if his example leads  other men to spend, and to suffer in the same way, the loss is still farther  increased; and so on, through all its effects.</p><p>  And even though the powder maker and the merchant have made enormous profit,  this does not prevent the loss to the community; any more than the profit of  lottery gamblers, or counterfeiters of the public coin, prevents loss to the  community. Nor does it meet the case, to say that the property changes hands.  This is not true. The man who sold the powder made a profit of only a part  even of the money which the other man paid for it; while he lost not only the  whole, but vastly more. The whole of the original cost was only a small part  of the loss to the buyer, and for the nation. The merchant gained nothing of  the time, and other numerous expenses, which the buyer lost; nor does he in  any way remunerate the community for that loss.</p><p>  Suppose that man, instead of buying the powder, had bought a pair of shoes;  and that the tanner and the shoemaker had gained in this case, what the  powder-maker and the merchant gained in the other; and that by the use of the  shoes, though they were finally worn out, the man gained twice as much as he  gave for them; without any loss of health, or reason, social affection, or  moral susceptibility; and without any of the consequent evils.—Who cannot see  that it would have increased his wealth, and that of the nation, without  injury to any, and have promoted the benefit of all.</p><p>  This illustrates the principle with regard to ardent spirit. A man buys a  quantity of it, and drinks it; when he would be, as the case with every man,  in all respects better without it. It is to him an entire loss. The merchant  may have made a profit of one quarter of the cost, but the buyer loses the  whole; and he loses the time employed in obtaining and drinking it. He loses,  also, and the community loses, equal to all its deteriorating effects upon his  body and mind, his children, and all who come under his influence. His land  becomes less productive. The capital of course produced by this land and labor  is diminished; and thus the means are diminished of future reproduction. And  by the increase of expenditure in proportion to the capital, it is still  farther diminished, till to meet the increasingly disproportionate expenses,  the whole is often taken, and the means of future reproduction are entirely  exhausted. And if there is no seed to sow, there is of course no future  harvest. This is but a simple history of what is taking in thousands of cases  continually; and of what is the tendency of the traffic in ardent spirit from  beginning to end. It lessens the productiveness of land and labor, and of  course diminishes the amount of capital; while in proportion, it increases the  expenditure, and thus in both ways is constantly exhausting the means of  future production. And this is its tendency, in all its bearing, in proportion  to the quantity used, from the man who takes only his glass, to the man who  takes his quart a day. It is a palpable and gross violation of all correct  principles of political economy; and from beginning to end, tends to diminish  all the sources of national wealth.</p>","Scholarly Notes":"Might we be sensing William's influence here?

[sic  no close parentheses]</p><p>  IN consequence of the light poured on the public, and the church, by the  spirited exertions of philanthropic individuals, a great change, in relation  to intoxicating liquors, has been produced. The eye, heart, and hand of  christian faith looks, prays, and acts for its completion.</p><p>  But another reformation is needed in the church. It must be as separate from  slavery, as from intemperance. The nation groans under the burden and misery  and guilt of both these sins. It is the solemn duty of the church to clear  itself from both these tremendous crimes. This is not addressed to the world,  for the world legalizes the traffic in rum, and in the bodies and souls of  men. But it is addressed to the children of God, who, if they know and do  their duty, can have no possible connection with either of these trades. If  increasing light has shown that christians ought not to buy and sell ardent  spirits, much more it is believed, will increasing light show that christians  ought not to buy human beings.</p><p>  The Rev John Newton, even after he became pious, transported Africans in  chains across the Atlantic, to be sold with their posterity into slavery.  Could he have been a true christian, and have no upbraidings of conscience  while so engaged? Yes. How is it possible? It was legal, and, at that time,  honorable, and his mind was not enlightened.—Afterwards when it was he  lamented his error. So there are in our country those who buy and sell their  fellow beings, who, if their minds were enlightened, would lament and  relinquish it.</p><p>  A few years ago, a man, whose whole daily earnings were required by his  family, set up forty nights to run a distillery for forty dollars, which he  gave to build a house of worship.—How could he think that money obtained by  changing the bread of the poor, into the liquid fire of death, acceptable to  God? Because his mind was in darkness. Would he do it now? No. Neither would  the church now receive it. Why? Because the light of the temperance  reformation has burst forth.</p><p>  Christians! who have promised supreme obedience to Him, that :tasted death for  every man,: and more for the rich man, who, in a superb dress, rides in a  superb carriage, to a superb church, to worship in superb style, than for the  poor African, who pulls cotton in the “fields of Alabama, and naked as in the  hour of birth, trembles under the blasts of mid winter”—on you is this call  for a reformation in the church of that God, who declares himself no respector  [sic] of persons.—Why do you exclude the dealer in ardent spirits from the  communion table, and invite to it the dealer in human flesh? This could not,  would not be, if there had been half so much effort made to show the utter  abominations of christian slavery, as there has been to show the abominations  of christian drunkenness. Whatever maybe the event of slavery and intemperance  in the world a sufficiency of light will show, and cause to be removed  these&nbsp; shocking deformities of the christian church. One denomination has  already raised thousands of dollars to assist their brethren in becoming free  from the deep stains of this awful sin. When will other denominations be  equally sincere and active to cleanse themselves from this pollution? The  answer is plain. When they are as conscientious and as much enlightened.</p><p>  To have light poured on this subject as its importance demands, it is proposed  to raise fifty dollars, as a premium for the best essay on this deeply  interesting subject. When the church if pure, we may then expect the smiles  and approbation of heaven on our now almost divided land. And oh! May none  refuse their mite to reward the close application of time and talents to this  most vitally important theme; for it is believed the temperance reformation  commenced in this way.</p><p>  Donations will be received by the Editors of the Genius of Temperance, and the  Editor of the Emancipator, 126, Nassau street, A part of the money has already  been raised by a few ladies in Massachusetts. It is hoped that others, who are  opposed to slavery in the church of Christ, will speedily forward enough to  make it up to $50, when the sum will be given to him who shall show most  conclusively to the christian church and to christian ministers, their duty to  “Break every yoke.” The essays which shall be written for the prize, are to be  judged, and the premium awarded, by ________</p><p>[N.B.—The blank will be filled, when the money is subscribed.]</p>","Scholarly Notes":"Did this essay contest actually run?","Commentary":"Charles Denison, editor of <em>The Emancipator</em>, and William Goodell of <em>The Genius of Temperance</em> were the two designated people to whom to send entries.

Thus, by  her false insinuations, she deprived her of the esteem of the world—that world  which will on day  <em>worship</em>  and the next  <em>stab</em>  you. Not contented with this, she persuaded Mr. Minnette to disinherit his  daughter, and make a will in favor of the little George, but her cruelty was  not to go unpunished. By some unforeseen losses in trade Mr. Minnette became  bankrupt, and was obliged to sell his splendid establishment in —— street, and  remove to a small house which belonged to Emily’s mother, and which was the  only property he could not be deprived of. But to return to Emily.</p><p>  The picture of former days would sometimes rise, and appear like a fairy  dream, from which she had been too soon awakened. She thought of the kind  mother who had been ever ready to gratify her childish wishes—and of Edward,  too, she thought much. Would he believe his sister’s falsehoods? was a  question that often perplexed her. And were there no mingling of resentment in  these recollections? Not any. Her heart had been taught a better discipline.</p><p>  Two years passed away, and Emily found peace, if not happiness. She was now  twenty-one years old, and it was in her power to retaliate her injuries, by  turning her father out of her house, which was now in her possession; but  instead of this she wrote a long and kind letter, entreating him to occupy it  as long as he wished.</p><p>  Having but little to engage her attention, Emily offered to teach a school for  the children of the village. For this purpose, a room was fitted up in a small  light building, erected near the river for the convenience of washing. During  her residence with her kind aunt, it had been her favorite care to ornament  and improve it. She had planted all around it the rose of cassia, jessamine,  honeysuckle and grape vines. Their mingled blossoms and intertwining branches  formed a luxuriant drapery, which soon became one mass of living verdure. From  this little nest of flowers, an avenue, shaded by old elms, led down to the  river, whose smooth surface was broken into ripples by the dipping branches of  the weeping willow, as its waters went sparkling and gleaming along in their  noiseless beauty. Here, in pleasant weather, Emily often ranged her scholars,  in the open air; and then there were bright eyes and happy faces, for children  do not love the confinement of a school room. The exercises of the day were  generally concluded with a hymn and prayer, in which all were taught to join.</p><p>  It was near the close of a delightful day in June, and their melodious voices  were just breaking the stillness of that beautiful solitude, when a gentleman,  attracted by the sound, came to the opposite bank, and, concealed by the  shade, listened with intense delight to the infant warblers.</p><p>  The last note died away, and a solemn pause ensued. “Now, my dear little  children,” said Emily, “will you join me, with your whole hearts, in a prayer  to our Heavenly Father who has watched over and protected us through the day.”  She then kneeled down on the green earth, and was soon encircled by her cherub  band of scholars, who also knelt and softly repeated, after their youthful  instructress, The Lord’s Prayer. Then came the fervent “amen”—“Amen!” repeated  their innocent lips, and “Amen!” echoed the green hills. Then, slowly, they  all arose, kissed Emily, one by one, crossed the little bridge, and  disappeared.</p><p>  But the stranger yet remained. It was Edward Brumiere, once the friend of  Emily—and if he had ever doubted her, could he any longer question the  goodness and purity of the beautiful being before him? It was impossible. A  moment, and he was at her side. Surprise deepened the rose on her cheek, and  she confessed the pleasure she felt in again meeting him. She extended her  hand to him with a cordial smile, for she had not yet learned to hide her  feelings under the mask of indifference.</p><p>  “I come from your father, my dear Emily. He is not very well, and feels the  want of your kindness and good nursing.”</p><p>  “But where is my ———mother?” she enquired, hesitatingly. “She is obliged to  divide her attentions between him and your little brother, who has been  sometime ill, of a lingering complaint, which they fear will terminate in a  consumption. But are you quite willing to forget your resentment?” “I have  none.” “Your injuries then?” “I freely forgive them as I hope to be forgiven.”</p><p>  “Do you know their extent? Driven from your home, calumniated, disinherited,  by one who pledged herself your friend.”</p><p>  While enumerating these, he closely watched her countenance, and finding there  no expression but forgiving love, he continued, “or do you not feel their  force?” An unbidden tear fell down her cheek, silently refuting the charge of  insensibility.</p><p>  Love sprung in his heart spontaneous; and tenderly taking her hand, he said  with much emotion, “Amiable girl!—have you no connection with earth, that you  have divested yourself of human passions and frailties.”</p><p>  “Afflictions have been sanctified to me, and have taught me that hatred and  happiness cannot exist in the same bosom.”</p><p>  “Matilda is my sister; forgive me, Emily! I believed what she said of you! I  could almost  <em>hate</em>  her for  <em>your</em>  sake, had you not given me a better example.”</p><p>  “It is perfectly natural to believe the assertions of those we love; but I  hope my study may be to contradict the tongue of slander by my conduct. Anger  so blinds our reason, that Matilda might imagine me the unkind, guilty  creature she represents me. Thus saying, she led the way to the house, where  she introduced Edward to her aunt.</p><p>The next morning found them at Mr. Minnette’s door.</p><p>  Edward remained in the parlor, that he might put no restraint upon the  feelings of either party, while Emily was shown to her father’s room. She  clung round his neck—he embraced her, and she once more felt happy in his  returning love.</p><p>  The open door of an adjoining room discovered Matilda, bending over the bed of  her sick child, with all a mother’s fondness in her looks. In her deep anxiety  the predominant expression of unbending pride was lost; and instead, there  seemed something like repentance, nay, even kindness as her eye rested on  Emily.</p><p>  From this time, Emily divided her cares between her father and brother, and  determined by her attentions to merit the love of her family. Perhaps she was  more condescending than some, yet none thought her mean-spirited, or weak, or  respected her the less; but all admired the forgiving spirit she displayed.</p><p>  Mr. Minnette soon recovered, which gave some reason to suspect that his  disorder originated in remorse; and now, Emily transferred all her attentions  to her suffering brother. She had, while with her aunt (who was the medical  adviser of the whole village) acquired considerable knowledge of roots and  herbs, and these she successfully employed in his recovery.</p><p>  Every day she carried the sufferer out of doors in her arms for the benefit of  exercise and fresh air, of which Matilda, by a mistake in the art of nursing,  had deprived him. He soon felt the good effect of the change, and the  delighted mother saw once more the glow of health upon his cheek, and  returning activity in his tiny limbs.</p><p>  Matilda’s haughty spirit had been broken down by adversity, and Emily’s  conduct had shamed “the offending spirit” out of her. Her understanding was  naturally good, but it had been perverted by a faulty education, dictated by  an injudiciously fond parent. A train of concurring circumstances roused her  better feelings and they triumphed over the errors of education and the  habitual follies of many years! and she bent before the altar of her God, a  repentant woman and a humble and sincere christian. And now, from being the  most wretched, they became, proverbially, the most united and happy family in  New-York. Having performed her duties at home, Emily, according to promise,  returned to her aunt, accompanied by Edward, who by the consent of all parties  had become her betrothed husband.</p><p>  “Let us be married, Emily,” said he, “on the anniversary of the river scene;  then I shall unite in one the two most interesting events of my life, my  marriage and the event which led to it.”</p><p>  A year from that day, Emily became the wife of Edward—and each succeeding one  finds her in the midst of love and happiness surrounded by her family of  little ones, to whom Edward annually repeats the Tale of Forgiveness.</p>","Scholarly Notes":"Stylistic analysis to determine who might have written this?

The community which  has the right to withhold power, delegates it, of course, for its own  advantage. If in any case its advantage is not consulted, then the object for  which it was delegated is frustrated—or in simple words, the measure which  does not promote the public welfare is not right. It matters nothing whether  the community have delegated specifically so much power for such and such  purposes: the power,  <em>being possessed,</em>  entails the obligation. Whether a sovereign derives absolute authority for a  year, the principles of their duty are the same. The obligation to employ it  only for the public good, is just as real and just as great in one case as in  the other. The Russian and the Turk have the same right to require that the  power of their rulers shall be so employed, as the Englishman or American.  They may not be able to assert this right, but that does not affect its  existence nor the ruler’s duty,—nor his responsibility to that  <em>Almighty</em>  Being before whom he must give an account of his stewardship. These  reasonings, if they needed confirmation, derive it from the fact that the  Deity imperatively requires us, according to our opportunities, to  <em>do good</em>  to man.</p><p>  But, how ready soever men are to admit the truth of this proposition as a  proposition, it is very commonly disregarded in practice; and a vast variety  of motives and objects direct the conduct of governments which have no  connection with the public weal. Some  <em>pretensions</em>  of consulting the public weal are, indeed, usual. It is not to be supposed  that when public officers are pursuing their own schemes and interests, they  will  <em>tell</em>  the people that they disregarded theirs. When we look over the history of a  christian nation, it is found that a large proportion of these measures which  are most prominent in it, had little tendency to subserve, and did not  subserve the public good. In practice it is very often forgotten for what  purpose governments are instituted. If a man were to look over twenty  treaties, he would probably find that half of them had very little to do with  the welfare of the respective communities. He might find a great feal about  Charles’ rights, and Frederick’s honor, and Louis’ possessions, and Francis’  interests,—as if the proper subjects of international arrangements were those  which respected rulers rather than communities. If a man looks over the state  papers which inform him of the origin of a war, he will probably fund that  they agitate questions about Most Christian and Most Catholic Kinds, and High  Mightinesses, and Imperial Majesties,—questions, however, in which Frenchmen,  and Spaniards, and Dutch, and Austrians, are very little interested or  concerned, or at any rate much less interested than they are in avoiding the  quarrel.</p><p>  Governments commonly trouble themselves unnecessarily and too much with the  politics of other nations. A prince should turn his back towards other  countries and his face towards his own,—just as the proper place of a  landholder is upon his own estates and not upon his neighbor’s. If governments  were wise, it would ere long be found, that a great portion of the endless and  wearisome succession of treaties, and remonstrances, and embassies, and  alliances, and memorials, and subsidies, might be dispensed with, with so  little inconvenience, and so much benefit, that the world would wonder to  think to what futile ends they had been busying and how needlessly they had  been injuring themselves.</p><p>  No doubt, the immoral and irrational system of international politics which  <em>generally</em>  obtains, makes the path of one government more difficult than it would  otherwise be; and yet it is probable that the most efficacious way of inducing  another government to attend to its proper business, would be to attend to our  own. It is not sufficiently considered, nor indeed is it sufficiently  <em>known</em>  , how powerful is the influence of uprightness and candor in conciliating the  good officers of other men. Overreaching and chicanery in one person, induce  overreaching and chicanery in another. Men distrust those whom they perceive  to be unworthy of confidence. Real integrity is not without its vouched in the  hearts of others; and they who maintain it are treated with confidence,  because it is seen that confidence can be safely reposed. Besides, he who  busies himself with the politics of foreign countries, like the busy bodies in  a petty community does not fail to offend. In the last century, our own  country was so much of a busy body, and had involved itself in such a  multitude of treaties and alliances, that it was found, I believe, quite  impossible to fulfil one without, by that very act, violating another. This,  of course, would offend. In private life that man passes through the world  with the least annoyance and the greatest satisfaction, who confines his  attention to its proper business, that is, generally, to his own: and who can  tell why the experience of nations should in this case by different from that  of private men? In a rectified state of international affairs, half a dozen  princes on a continent would have little more occasion to meddle with one  another than half a dozen neighbors in a street.</p><p>  But indeed,  <em>Communities</em>  frequently contribute to their own injury. If governors are ambitious, or  resentful, or proud, so, often, are the people;—and the public good has often  been sacrificed by the public, with astonishing preposterousness, to jealousy  or vexation. Some merchants are angry at the loss of a branch of trade; they  urge the government to interfere; memorials and remonstrances follow to the  state of whom they complain;—and so, by that process of exasperation which is  quite natural when people think that high language and a high attitude is  politic, the nations soon begin to fight. The merchants applaud the spirit of  their rulers,—while in one year they lose more by war than they would have  lost by the want of the trade for twenty; and before peace returns, the nation  has lost more than it would have lost by the continuance of the evil for  twenty centuries. Peace at length arrives, and the government begins to devise  means of repairing the mischiefs of the war. Both government and people  reflect very complacently on the wisdom of their measures,—forgetting that  their conduct is only that of a man who wantonly fractures his own leg with a  club, and then boasts to his neighbors how dexterously he limps to a surgeon.</p><p>  Present expedients for present occasions, rather than a wide embracing and  far-seeing policy, is the great characteristic of European politics. We are  hucksters who cannot resist the temptation of a present sixpence, rather than  merchants who wait for their profits for the return of a fleet. Si quaeris  monumentum, circumspice. [If you are looking for a monument, look around.]  Look at the condition of either of the continental nations, and consider what  it might have been if even a short line of princes had attended to their  proper business,—had directed their solicitude to the improvement of the moral  and social and political condition of the people. Who has been more successful  in this huckster policy than France? And what is France, and what are the  French people at the present hour?—Why, as it respects real welfare they are  not merely surpassed, they are left at an immeasurable distance, by a people  who sprung up but as yesterday,—by a people whose land, within the memory of  our grand-fathers, was almost a wilderness, long since France boasted of her  greatness. Such results have a cause. It is not possible that systems of  policy can be good, of which the effects are so bad. I speak not of particular  measures or of individual acts of ill policy,—these are not likely to be the  result of the condition of man,—but of the whole international system,—a  system of irritability, and haughtiness, and temporary expedients; a system of  most unphilosophical principles, and from which christianity is practically  almost excluded. Here is the evidence of fact before us. We know what a  sickening detail the history of Europe is. And it is obvious to remark, that  the system which has given rise to such a history must be vicious and mistaken  in its fundamental principles. The same class of history will continue to  after generations unless these principles are changed,—unless philosophy and  christianity obtain a greater influence in the practice of government; unless,  in a word, governments are content to do their proper business, and to leave  that which is not their business, undone.</p><p>  When such principles are acted upon we may reasonably expect a rapid  advancement in the whole condition of the world. Domestic measures which are  now postponed to the more stirring occupations of legislators, will be found  to be of incomparably greater importance than they. A wise code of criminal  law will be found to be of more consequence and interest than the acquisition  of a million square miles of territory;—A judicious encouragement of general  education will be of more value than all the “glory” that has been acquired  from the days of Alfred till now. Of moral legislation, however it will be our  after business to speak; Meanwhile the lover of mankind has some reason for  gratulation in perceiving indications that governments will hereafter direct  their attention more to the objects for which they are invested with power.  The statesmen who promotes this improvement will be what many statesmen have  been  <em>called</em>  —a great man. That government only is great which promotes the prosperity of  its own people; and that people only are prosperous, who are wise and happy.</p>","Scholarly Notes":null,"Commentary":"The presence of this excerpt implies that the<br><em>Unionist</em><br>had likely published the previous essay, too, in Dymond's work.

We are in the midst of a political revolution, which is  silently but fatally sapping the principles of our free institutions, and  consolidating the whole action of the Government, into the will of the  executive. “The President is far above the reach of anything said in this  House,” said Mr Polk; and a passive House of Representatives—the people’s own  House—hear without resenting the insolent assertion, and by their silence  admit its truth. Yet the minister or favorite, who, on the floor of the  English House of Commons, or of the French Chamber of Deputies, should hazard  such a vaunt of the crowned monarchs of either of those realms, would be put  to silence and to shame, by the indignant voices of men of  <em>all</em>  parties. He would, in those  <em>limited monarchies</em>  be told that the king, like the humblest man in the kingdom, was the subject  of the laws and the creature of opinion; and that it belonged not to him, or  to any one for him, to claim exemption from that dependence upon the people’s  representatives, ordained for the common good o all. In this  <em>freest of republics,</em>  infallibility in judgement and in action; the right of constructing according  to his own will all laws, and of dismissing at his own will all functionaries  who see not with his eyes; and finally entire independence of the opinion of  the Legislatures; are openly claimed for the Executive; and all who demur in  the least to this sweeping claim, or who suggest that, even with the best  motives, and the greatest caution, there may be error or mistake in some given  act, are denounced as enemies to the “venerable President,” and forthwith  trampled under foot as rebels and traitors—not to the country, or to  freedom—but to  <em>the</em>  party. We are then in the midst of a revolution, which is habituating us fast  and fatally to disregard all those checks and balances which the wise  contrivers of the Constitution, thought sufficient and availing, to secure the  independence of each department in its proper sphere; and to look to the  Executive head alone, as the fountain of all honor, profit and power. Nor is  it to politics alone that the revolution is confined. In a country like this,  where every citizen does, or may if he pleases, take a part in its public  affairs, no great revolution in politics can be effected without a  corresponding revolution in morals. Accordingly we find that the spirit of  party, which now directs all its discipline and energy to sustain allegiance  and devotion to the person of the President—be his measures what they  may—infects the judgement or corrupts the principles of men on other subjects,  and the recklessness with which conscience is outraged, in approving political  measures, which in fact it disapproved—may come at last to pervert entirely  the warning voice of that secret monitor.</p><p>  It would seem the very “error of the moon” that men and doctrines such as  these we have this alluded to, should find a place and a bearing in the  Legislative halls of a people so practical, and which flatters itself with  being so enlightened, as ours—were it not that a sufficient earthly  explanation is at hand in the cause we referred to in the outset of these  remarks—the spirit of party—which, so that implicit and uncompromising  obedience be rendered to its mandates, is little solicitous about any other  qualifications, in the instruments it puts forth. Truly indeed did Mr Binney  conclude, that the question now in issue in this country is, whether this  “spirit of party” be not more fatal to free institutions here, than the spirit  of despotism has proved elsewhere. Its inevitable tendency, at any rate, is to  degrade, even though it may not wholly destroy;—and in that stage of the  question, most certainly, this State now is.—  <em>N.Y.

The  information having been read, the defendant for plea, said that he was NOT  GUILTY.</p><p>  <em>Ebenezer Sangar</em>  was at the house of Miss Crandall the day of the fire—did not get there till  it was pretty much over. The house was wet, and people were at work about it,  cutting up the floors, &amp;c. While witness was in the house, Mr. Olney (the  defendant) came in and told Capt. Bacon, who was cutting up the mop-board,  that it was useless to cut longer for there was no fire. People soon began to  go away. Mr. Olney showed where he said the fire commenced—placed his hand on  a particular place and the expressed he used was “  <em>Gentlemen of the jury, here the fire commenced.”</em>  He had an iron-bar in his hand, with which he took off the moulding &amp;c.,  to show what the fire had done. It seemed that the fire had worked from the  inside of the house to the outside—this appeared by the boards and timbers—the  top of the soil was burnt off, as was also the outside—it was rotten so that  it might be picked to pieces—the bottom of the sill was not burnt. In the  north-east room, below, there was in the inside under the mop-board a crack  which was perhaps three-eights [sic] of an inch in width—the fire-place is on  the west side of the room—the house fronts the east—the fire was in the  north-east corner of the room. There was no difficulty, in the opinion of the  witness, in setting the house on fire in the way it was from the inside—it  might have been done by thrusting under-lighted paper, &amp;c. If fired in  this way the outer edge of the sill would be likely to catch first. Should not  think that fire could have been put on the outside so as to cause the  fire—does not think it possible that the top of the sill could have been set  fire to from the outside, as this sill was. The principal part of the burning  was high up near the chamber floor.</p><p>  <em>Cross-examined.</em>  Saw no fire after he got there. Most of the cutting was done before he got  there—the weather-board was taken up and the mouldings—some clap-boards had  been taken off before—it was from 12 to 15 inches from the upright post, and  south of it, in the corner of the room where the fire did most damage. No hole  was burned, but the wood was blacked—should think the fire originally  commenced at the place mentioned near the post. The board next the sill, and  the side of it next the sill, was burned most—this board had a crack in it,  and the wood near the crack was charred, mostly on the inside. The lathing was  burned some, enough so as to black one’s fingers—witness did not make his  examinations all at one time, but at several—once with Dr. Harris.</p><p>  <em>Vine Robinson.</em>  On Saturday of the week that the fire happened he went, as one of the  committee from the Insurance Company, to make some agreement, if possible,  with Miss Crandall as to the amount of loss which she had sustained. The house  seemed to be in the same situation as it was left immediately after the  fire—the clap-boards were torn off, &amp;c. Examined, to satisfy his mind, how  the fire originated—became convinced that it took first on the sill, between  the first stud and the post—burned apparently up to the chamber-floor, and  meeting with some instruction there, seemed to branch off—burned the boards  and joist, should think there was more burning in the chamber-floor than  elsewhere—proceeded to place the boards, &amp;c. round the pilaster as they  originally were, in order to ascertain if there was any place where the fire  could have been introduced from without—the board at the bottom of the sill  was burnet off—the clap-boards were not burnt—found no place on examination  where the fire could have been introduced—thinks it impossible to have  communicated the fire from the outside so as to produce the effect visible—the  crack between the mop-board and the floor on the inside of the room was  perhaps one third of an inch wide—no difficulty in putting fire under it—if a  match were placed under the mop-board and pushed along it would fall about two  inches on to the sill—witness became satisfied that the Company would be  responsible for the loss, and tried to settle the amount but could not. It was  left to Col. Eaton to procure a carpenter and finish the business—the sill was  considerably decayed—the fire was confined between the first stud and the  post.</p><p>  <em>Cross examined.</em>  There was a hole burnt in the boards a considerable height from the ground,  higher than he could reach—this could be seen from the outside—the board at  the bottom was perhaps 8 inches wide—three or four inches of it were burnt  off—this board was near the post—about the space of a foot along the sill it  was charred—the sill at the bottom was whole.</p><p>  <em>Ebenezer Sangar,</em>  again called, testified as to one of the boards that was burnt near the  post—the board went to the bottom of the sill.</p><p>  <em>Elkanah C. Eaton</em>  was also one of the Committee with Judge Robinson to settle damages, and with  him examined to find out the origin of the fire. (Col. Eaton said he concurred  in the statement given by Judge Robinson, and recapitulated, with little  variation, the same general facts.)</p><p>  <em>Richard Fenner</em>  got to the fire nearly as soon as any one—saw the smoke from the outside, and  went directly into the house. Saw Miss Crandall and asked her if the fire came  from the cellar; she said, no, her house had been set on fire. Witness  assisted to pry up the hearth to find the fire, but found but little—the smoke  continued to increase—water was thrown on. After the fire was got under, Olney  shoed the witness and others a spot on the outside of the house, where he said  the fire began—witness examined it more critically, because he did not notice  it when he first came to the fire; Witness came out of his store immediately  after he heard the bell ring, and a cry of fire—Saw smoke come from the corner  of the house, up some height from the ground.—Olney said that when he first  came out of the house, he saw fire blazing out of a crack, and pointed it out  to witness—the paint around it was scorched.</p><p>  <em>Cross Examined.</em>  The crack with Olney showed witness was perhaps an eighth of an inch in width,  just by the bottom of the sill, between the bottom board and the moulding—saw  no appearance of fire when the place was pointed out—witness at first saw no  fire, nothing but smoke which came from about the window casings—Olney was at  the corner of the house when he got there and had an axe in his hand—it was  after the fire was over that Olney pointed out this place—perhaps  three-fourths of an hour after the alarm.</p><p>  <em>Daniel Morgan</em>  was at the house of Dr. Harris at the time of the fire, and noticed a tub of  water brought out from Miss Crandall’s and thrown on to the side of the  house—a little steam arose which led him to suppose the water was hot—Charles  Harris soon brought an axe—Olney took it and struck a blow or two on the house  near the corner with it. Witness then went over to Miss C’s house, but saw no  fire—looked into the house and saw smoke in the room—told Miss C. that it must  come from the cellar—examined, but found none—a little smoke could not be seen  coming out from the house, seven or eight feet from the ground, near the  floor—they had axes and struck in to take off the clapboards—took off some but  saw no fire till the floor was torn up in the chamber—then saw a little and a  great deal of smoke, so much that it was impossible to stay in the room. The  sill appeared natural, but some rotten—took out some shavings which were black  but not burnt—witness got to the house before any one, unless it was Mr.  Robinson—as he could see no fire he was surprised that they had raised an  alarm—did not see Olney when he first got over to the house—when he first saw  him he was near the corner of the house—the clapboards which&nbsp; he and Mr  Robinson cut were as high as they could reach.</p><p>  <em>Cross Examined.</em>  Witness saw Olney and Harris at the corner of Miss Crandall’s house, before he  came over from Dr Harris’—Harris soon started to ring the bell and Olney  dashed on a tub of water—this was before the blows with an axe—the water was  thrown on the side of the house, between the window and the post—cannot say  whether Olney cut off any portion of the house—thought that a small piece was  cut off at first—continued to think so till the former trial, when a piece was  shown, said to be cut off—he then and now doubts whether any was cut off—Dr.  Harris’ house is six or seven rods from Miss Crandall’s.</p><p>  <em>Ralph Robinson</em>  got to the fire, when some of the neighbors were standing at the corner—could  see smoke coming out—witness tried to cut off some of the clapboards, but  could not reach them—pried them off with an iron bar—they could then see a  little fire—no clapboards had been cut when witness got there—did not leave  his school house till after the bell rung—saw no fire at the bottom of the  pilaster—the clap-boards were got off in a very few minutes, perhaps three—saw  water thrown on after the clap-boards were taken off, not before.</p><p>  <em>Peter Spicer,</em>  (a carpenter,) examined the house day of the the first court (sic). [Mr.  Spicer showed the manner in which the boards &amp;c. were burned, and gave it  as his opinion that the fire communicated from within.]</p><p>  <em>Horace Bacon,</em>  assisted to arrest Frederick Olney, it was in a barber’s shop at Norwich—a  number of persons were present—some one asked witness his opinion as to the  origin of the fire—said that he believed it caught from the inside. Olney said  he knew as much about the fire as any one. Witness replied, I suppose you do.  Olney then said that Miss Crandall wished him to fix her clock—that he  commenced fixing it and soon found smoke in the room—at first thought the  evergreens in the room were on fire, examined them and found they were  not—then thought the carpet was—found that it was not. Soon heard the fire  roar in the walls of the house ran out and saw it burst out from a crack near  the corner of the house.</p><p>  <em>James Cary</em>  read the warrant to Olney in Norwich. Mr Bacon said that he thought the fire  caught on the inside—Olney said that there was a knot-hole outside about the  bigness of a dollar where the fire might have been placed. (Witness then went  out).</p><p>  <em>Maria Robinson</em>  was at Miss Crandall’s house at work on the 28  <sup>th</sup>  day of January, the day of the fire—the stage stopped, and the first she saw  Olney he was standing by the side of the stage—some bundles &amp;c. were  brought into the house and Olney came in and sat down in the keeping-room by  the fire, remarked that it was cold, looking at the clock on the mantel-piece,  after he had sat a few moments, said to Miss Crandall, “your clock does not  beat right.” Miss Crandall replied, that she had not noticed it, or did not  know it. Miss Crandall soon asked him to take off his surtout, and said that  she had not asked him before because she supposed he was cold—Mr Olney asked  if Mr. and Mrs Harris were in the house, and was told they were in the  kitchen, said to Miss Crandall, “with your permission I will go and see them,”  she said, yes—he came back in a little while, and that he had promised to  write to a lady in New-York as soon as he got there and had seen her little  daughter, the paper was brought, and Olney wrote and sealed a letter, he then  went out and witness saw him no more till dinner, when she saw him in the  upper kitchen, talking with Mr. and Mrs. Harris. After dinner she came back to  the keeping-room, and a number of the girls were in and out. They all went out  but witness, as she thinks, (she remarked that Miss Almira Crandall thought  she remained after her) and witness, who was sewing, laid down her work, and  went to the kitchen. Had heard Olney talking in the kitchen before this, and  had seen him there. Very soon there was a disturbance, and some one cried that  the house was on fire. Witness said it could not be, but ran up stairs, for  she remembered that she had left her work on the hearth and she was afraid  that it had caught fire. Found the room so full of smoke, when she got to it,  that she could not see the figure on the paper. Ran out of doors, and saw  Olney standing near the corner of the house, looking for the fire. Witness  told him that the chimney or roof was on fire, he said no, and soon said he  had found it. Olney then struck on the corner of the house, with an axe, and  told her to cry fire. It was about half-past ten or eleven when Olney came in  the stage, witness noticed no smoke nor perceived any unpleasant smell in the  keeping-room before fire was cried, don’t know where Olney went when he went  from the keeping-room, but supposed he went to the kitchen.</p><p>  <em>Cross examined.</em>  Was in the keeping-room when the stage came up—soon after Olney came in the  clock struck eleven—thinks it was an hour after dinner when she was employed  sewing—Olney had not been alone in the keeping-room&nbsp; more than a minute,  when the fire was cried—after Olney had struck on the corner of the house with  the axe, he called for water—he had asked for an axe before—he cut off a small  piece of the house, and some one bro’t water—told Harris to get the bell  rung—heard nothing said about fixing the clock—there were festoons of  evergreen hung around the room.</p><p>  <em>Amy Fenner</em>  was in the school room at the time of the fire—saw Mr. Olney as he came in the  stage, at about half past ten—saw him no more till dinner. Witness went  upstairs to the school room, and Miss Crandall sent the class down to  read—they came down to the keeping-room, and witness saw Mr. Olney fixing the  clock—she saw smoke, and said to Mr. Olney, What is the matter? What does this  mean? She pointed Olney to the corner of the room—he put down his ear, and  said he heard it roar—then immediately called for an axe—witness was very much  scared.  <strong>This is the key testimony, from a student</strong></p><p>  <em>Cross examined.</em>  Knows nothing of the letter—Olney was talking with Mrs. Harris when witness  saw him at dinner—‘twas not more than three minutes after she was told to go  down with the class to read before she was in the room with Olney—he was  alone—the door was wide open—cannot tell what Olney was doing to the clock,  she was so frightened—smelled nothing in the room before—Olney’s back was  towards the smoke, he could not see it without turning round—witness could see  it immediately on entering—heard no walking in the room before she came in,  was out of doors when the tub of water was thrown on the house—Olney took the  tub from the hands of Miss Crandall—cannot tell whether the door of the clock  was open or not she was so frightened—the smoke had just began to come out of  the corner.</p><p>  <em>Henrietta Bolt</em>  was a member of the same class, and made a statement similar to the last  witness.</p><p>  <em>Delano Baker</em>  was at the fire not long after it was cried—went from Dr. Harris’ wood-pile,  saw smoke, but no fire was visible—Olney was standing by the corner of the  house, axes were called for, witness said he could get one. After the fire was  over Olney showed where he said the fire began—said, “here, gentlemen of the  jury, here is the place where the fire began.” Witness went away soon, and did  not notice where Olney directed their attention—saw no fire at the former,  when he got to the house first; thinks he should have seen it if there had  been any; a spot was burned up some distance from the ground. What is implied  by Olney using legalistic language here? Prescience?</p><p>  <em>Cross examined.</em>  Was a stranger in the place, and does not know the people who were at the  house; should not know the girls of the house again if he saw them.</p><p>  <em>Augustus Prior</em>  went with Col. Eaton to examine the house in order to ascertain the damages;  it was on Monday. (second examination.) [Mr. Prior agreed generally in his  statement with Col. Eaton, and was of opinion that the fire was communicated  from within.]</p><p>  <em>Ralph Hutchinson</em>  examined the house of Miss Crandall on the day of the court of inquiry before  the Justice; the board on the outside, near the crack, was burnt to a coal; a  part of the burning could be seen from the outside; did not notice whether the  lath was burnt or not; the pedestal is 16 3-4 inches; the base of the pilaster  1 1-4 feet; the mop-board was up from the floor a full half inch, a foot from  the corner; the first stud was perhaps 13 inches from the post; thinks the  fire could easily have been introduced from the inside; the mortar was gone at  the time of the examination made b witness, and that being gone, the fire  could also have been introduced from the outside; if the mortar had not been  taken out, he should think it could not have been introduced from the outside;  witness saw mortar lying on the ground.</p><p>  <em>Cross examined.</em>  The place where the burnt part could be seen from without, was by the  water-stable; it was just perceivable; should think the fire might have been  seen at this place from without; the bottom board sets on the water-table; the  inside of the oak board was burnt very much; the outside not much; the fire  could not have been put on the top of the sill from the outside.</p><p>  <em>Chauncey Bacon,</em>  at the time that Miss Crandall’s house was discovered to be on fire, was in  Mr. Jenk’s store. At first, he heard the bell ring, and saw people running,  apparently towards Miss C.’s house. When he got to her front gate, he asked  what was the matter? Was told, by a boy, that the house was on fire, and was  pointed towards the northeast corner of the house; went directly into the  house and found considerable smoke; some one took an axe, and beat a hole from  the inside, through the plaster, in the east wall of the room; being told, on  enquiry, that there was no other axe, witness got one from home and beat a  number of holes in the north wall of the room; found no fire, and but little  or no smoke; others were turning in water; witness then went into the cellar  to look for the fire, but found none; then to the garret, and found none; soon  after, witness went out of doors and found the people tearing off boards,  &amp;c.; some were cutting up the boards in the floor up stairs, and he  assisted; smoke came out and they threw in water; came down stairs, and saw  fire first near the cornice, in the room below; could see but a small blaze;  ran up stairs and told the people that the floor must come up; they took it  up, together with the mop-board and very soon came to the fire; six or eight  feet of the mop-board was cut off; the fire was soon got under; witness then  examined the timbers, &amp;c. more particularly, though he could not do so as  he wished, there was such a crowd; the lining boards were oak, put on the  studs, and ran clear by, to the cut-edge of the post; the bottom board, south  of where it was burnt off, was very snug, so that he could not pass a penknife  in the crack; the crack between the mop-board and the floor, in the lower  room, was large enough to take in his little finger, in some places; the under  floor boards set on the sill about four inches; the upper ones an inch less;  should not think it possible to get fire on the sill from the outside.</p><p>  <em>Cross examined.</em>  He put his finger in the crack, between the floor and the mop-board; the  widest part of it was towards the south, at some distance from the corner,  perhaps six feet; the floor boards run north and south; put his finger in the  crack the day after the fire, and has since examined it; should think that the  crack was 1-4 on an inch, near the corner; perceived no difference in its  width at the different times he examined it; don’t know whether the sill was  burnt at the bottom or on the sides; should think the under lining board was  wider than the sill; the end of the bottom board was nurnt off; the board  above it extends along to the end, so he presumes this one did; cannot say  whether the board burnt off was fastened to the sill or not; has not examined  the sill south of the stud where te fire was; found shavings between the studs  after taking off the plastering; but few, perhaps three, four, or half a  dozen. They were further south than where the fire was, between the first stud  and post; don't recollect whether burnt or not; they were small pieces, not  bigger than ninepenny pieces or cents; were old, and had probably been there  from the building of the house.</p><p>  <em>John Bard.</em>  (This witness was present during the fire, and assisted to extinguish it; he  gave particulars of the transaction, but stated to new facts that seemed  material.)</p><p>  <em>Solomon Paine,</em>  with the committee from the Insurance Company, examined the premises after the  fire. (Mr. Paine said he coincided in the statement made by Col. Eaton as to  what they saw.) His opinion was, that if the lining board was as wide at the  place where the fire was, as it was farther back, it would be impossible to  set the fire from the outside; the board was some inches higher than the sill,  a little back from the fire, where it was not burnt.</p><p>  <em>Nehemiah Ensworth.</em>  After he got to the fire, to which he was called by the ringing of the bell,  he first went to the corner of the house and soon went into the house, met  Olney and asked how the fire caught. Olney replied that he did not know, said  he saw it about as soon as any one, that he was fixing the clock, saw a smoke,  examined, and soon heard the fire roar, witness at this time did not know  Olney.</p><p>  <em>Daniel Morgan</em>  again called. Saw the mortar taken out from the outside after the fire; it was  whole.</p><p>  <em>Cross examined.</em>  Did not state this fact before the other court, though he did to some one  present, perhaps Capt. Fenner, several persons took out some of the mortar,  witness took out some, an inch and a half long, took it out to examine the  sill, has not examined else-where, what he took out was moist, took it out  with his fingers, some had been taken out before, cannot be positive who took  it out; it was after the fire had been extinguished; Mr. Flint was present;  thinks he took out some; it was under the sill and ran perpendicular; the  mortar which he (the witness) took out was between the stones, immediately  below the sill, not more than two or three inches below.</p><p>  <em>William Worthington.</em>  After the fire was pretty much out, Olney went up stairs and put his arm round  one of the girl’s neck, and asked how many of them cried? They said, such a  one. Olney then said they had no need to be scared before they were hurt; that  he did not think the house would burn down, if it had, Miss Crandall would  lose nothing for the house was insured; witness got to the house before the  fire broke out; could then see no fire; went close to the corner; saw smoke;  did not see Olney for a few minutes; no clapboards were cut when he (the  witness) first got there. Mr. Robinson cut the first as high as he could  reach.</p><p>  <em>Cross examined.</em>  Don’t know how many girls were present at the time of conversation he speaks  of, shouldn’t know them now; witness was a pupil in Mr. Robinson’s school; he  was in school, and it was said that Miss Crandall’s house was on fire; Mr. R.  got there about as soon as they did; don’t know whether Mr Morgan was then  there or not; saw him soon; did not see Miss Crandall; saw no water when he  first got there; looked round to find the fire, and then went into the house;  they had cut a few holes in the plastering; saw Olney near the corner of the  house first.</p><p>  <em>Luther Sangar.</em>  (This was also a pupil of Mr. Robinson, was with the last witness and made a  similar statement.)</p><p>[The prosecution here rested for the present.]</p><p align=\"center\">[To be concluded in our next.]</p><p></p>","Scholarly Notes":null,"Commentary":"No other unique document in <em>The Unionist</em> surpasses the value of their reportage on the trial of Frederick Olney"},{"pid":"obj250","identifier":"unionist--text-0250","title":"Mr. Pearl","bibliographicCitation":"<em>The Unionist</em> 1834-03-13","bibliographicCitation.republished":null,"fullIssueSequenceNumber":"1834-03-13 p.03.14","creator":"Charles C.

We trust, not the slightest  suspicion of his guilt remains on the mind of any disinterested persons, who  heard the trial. The jury would probably have given their verdict without  leaving their seats, if they had previously chosen a foreman. But so soon as  they had retired to their room and organized, they gave a unanimous vote in  his favor. And this they might have done if they had heard only the evidence  on the part of the State—for the testimony of some of the witnesses brought  forward by the public prosecutor, went to show clearly that even if the fire  were communicated on the inside, Mr. Olney could not have done it.</p><p>  Now, therefore, that Col. Judson and his coadjutors have been permitted to  indulge their suspicions to the utmost, and to subject a perfectly innocent  man to the mortification and expense of a criminal prosecution, because he  happened to be on the  <em>inside</em>  of Miss Crandall’s house on the day of the fire, now, we seriously hope the he  and they will look diligently among those on the  <em>outside</em>  of the house for the real incendiary. No one, we trust, is willing to suspect  that the Col. or any of the respectable people in Canterbury, did the deed;  but there probably are persons in the town capable of such a crime—or some who  might do it without considering it would be a  <em>crime</em>  thus, or in any other way, to “break up” the “nigger school.” Col. Judson and  his fellow laborers against that school have done all in their power to excite  the most virulent and reckless hostility to it. We were ourselves present in  the famous town meeting on the 9  <sup>th</sup>  of March, 1833, and there we heard enough said by the Col. and his colleagues  to instigate persons of a certain character to violence against the school. It  is notorious that minor acts of violence have repeatedly been committed  against her house—and they must not wonder if those who have thrown stones and  rotten eggs and filth, with impunity if not with applause, should be  emboldened to apply even the slow match. That this or something like this was  meditated the public are compelled to believe by the article in the Advertiser  of Dec. 19  <sup>th*</sup>  —and will not all have reason to suspect that the Col. and his coadjutors and  the public prosecutor are leagued to protect the real culprit, unless they now  set about in earnest to find him, in the direction pointed out by Mr.  Holbrook? This mysterious affair ought to be cleared up. No one could rejoice  more than we should do to have it satisfactory proved, that the fire was  accidental. But there appears to be scarcely any doubt that it was the work of  an incendiary. Therefore let the felon be hunted for without further delay.  Mr. Holbrook has refused to give to the public at our request, and has even  refused to give to Miss Crandall, an explanation of his meaning in the article  to which we have so often alluded. But Col. Judson and the State’s Attorney  can doubtless elicit from him the information which has so long been called  for in vain.</p>","Scholarly Notes":null,"Commentary":null},{"pid":"obj253","identifier":"unionist--text-0253","title":"Reprint of incendiary call from the Windham Advertiser","bibliographicCitation":"<em>The Unionist</em> 1834-03-13","bibliographicCitation.republished":"<em>Windham Advertiser</em> 1834-12-19","fullIssueSequenceNumber":"1834-03-13 p.03.17","creator":"<em>Windham Advertiser</em> 1834-12-19","_date.created":"1834-03-13","description":"Reprint of the \"wink-and-a-nod\" concerning the decision to \"BREAK UP\" the Canterbury Female Academy","language":"English","publisher":"<em>The Unionist</em>","IsPartOf":null,"rights":"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/","source":"<em>The Unionist</em>","subject":"Canterbury Female Academy; African-American Students; Education; Race; Vigilante Violence; Prudence Crandall","type":"Text","category":"Unionist full issue","article.type":null,"volume":"1","issue":"32","transcription":"<p>  *The Advertiser of the 19  <sup>th</sup>  of last December contained the following article:</p><p>  <em>To all whom it may concern.</em>  —From what we can learn, we have great reason to believe that a  <em>determination</em>  has been formed to BREAK UP the  <em>negro school</em>  in Canterbury by some means or other in less than two months.

Uncle Davy Kies seems to think they are  <em>“All Hearty”</em>  but you know he don’t reside at Head-Quarters now. The last orders were dated  at Canterbury a few rods North of Miss Crandall’s school. It was officially  announced here this morning by one of the recruiting officers, (the  <em>gentleman</em>  who ran away from Brooklyn a few years ago with some hundreds of the people’s  money, and who, in consequence of his clamorous declamations in favor of  Jackson, is now enjoying a considerable bite of Uncle Sam’s treasury pap,  against the known wishes of the people,) that Uncle Davy’s Democrats were all  ready for action. That the misunderstanding nad difficulty among the officers  had blown over and all were as good friends as ever. Col. A.T. the commanding  officer, is looking out for promotion. Uncle Davy says when all the officers  of his division get together this Spring at New-Haven, he will have the Col.  appointed Commissary, Judge, or something which he will like much better than  actual service in the field, and thus give a better chance for the under  officers. But the Col. would be altogether out of his place, on the bench. He  would appear, and no doubt feel, much like Jack Downing’s mouse, treed in an  empty flour barrel.—The old gentleman has not concluded yet whether to issue  another Proclamation or not—but he says something must be done to procure more  soldiers. He don’t seem to like the appearance of the old Republican army, and  what looks more cloudy than any thing else, he don’t think it will do to come  into action till he gets a new recruit from Windham. But every good soldier  listed in the Republican army just as soon as&nbsp; they found out what Uncle  Davy and the ‘Arch Bishop’ were up to. You might as well undertake to make  Bull-Frog pond run right over ‘Zion’s Hill’ as to get one of the Republicans  to join the enemy.</p><p>  We have just nominated our candidate to represent this district in the next  Legislature. But he don’t care any thing about the office. Col. Spafford is  one of the genuine old fashioned republicans, a straight forward, common sense  man, who, if he should be elected, will do the thing that is right. He is not  for abolishing Sabbath laws, or Thanksgiving laws. He believes in none of the  new-fangled black laws, or New-Haven memorials, but will go straight a-head as  every independent republican should do, supporting such measures only as will  operate equally upon all our citizens. He will never consent, like Mr. Pearl,  to put his eggs in Judson’s basket.</p><p align=\"right\">REPUBLICAN ELECTOR</p>","Scholarly Notes":null,"Commentary":"The candidate running against Philip Pearl was Col.

No. It is a time for  <em>united</em>  and  <em>vigorous</em>  action and I rejoice that we are yet free and CAN act. Is there an honest  independent elector who cannot find motives enough to stimulate him to  exertion? Shall this great people suffer all manner of oppression and not make  an effort to free themselves from it? Shall the counsel of their  Representatives be disregarded with impunity? Shall their petitions for relief  be wholly rejected and their agents treated with gross indignity by the  Executive Head of this nation?—There are motives enough and I trust they will  have their legitimate influence. The first Monday of April which is just at  hand is an important day to the Free Electors of this state. And let no one  who pretends to be a FREEMAN say, that he is no politician and cares not for  the result of the election. But let each one remember that he owes a duty to  his country which he is bound to perform. Are you told by some officious  office holder that our state election has nothing to do with Jacksonism,  &amp;c. &amp;c.? Believe it not, it is mere deception. Let the Jackson ticket  in this state prevail and the triumph of “the party” would be sounded by all  the collar presses from the little Windham C. Advertiser up to the great  official Globe. But let each elector who regards the well being of our free  institutions, and who loves his country better than he does the flattery of  fawning sycophants see to it that his ballot counts against the advocates of  usurpation; and Connecticut is safe.</p><p align=\"right\"><strong>N.P.</strong></p>","Scholarly Notes":null,"Commentary":null},{"pid":"obj257","identifier":"unionist--text-0257","title":"Melancholy Disaster [Wreck of the William Penn]","bibliographicCitation":"<em>The Unionist</em> 1834-03-13","bibliographicCitation.republished":"<em>The U.S. Gazette</em><br>","fullIssueSequenceNumber":"1834-03-13 p.03.21","creator":"<em>The U.S. Gazette</em>","_date.created":"1834-03-13","description":"Account of the wreck of the William Penn in Philadelphia.","language":"English","publisher":"<em>The Unionist</em>","IsPartOf":null,"rights":"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/","source":"<em>The Unionist</em>","subject":"National News","type":"Text","category":"Unionist full issue","article.type":null,"volume":"1","issue":"32","transcription":"<p align=\"center\"><em>From The U.S. Gazette.</em></p><p>  MELANCHOLY ACCIDENT — Yesterday afternoon, (Wednesday 5  <sup>th</sup>  inst.) about 5 o’clock P.M. just as the William Penn, with about 150  passengers, from Baltimore, had come round the point, below this city,  (Philadelphia,) she was discovered to be on fire near the furnace.

His pamphlet being locally available suggests, once again, that the students at the Canterbury Female Academy were reading about their own struggle!</p><p> <p><br></p><br><p>The pamphlet in question, for instance, compared the Canterbury Female Academy students to impressed sailors (one of the alleged causes of the War of 1812):<br>  “The war of the revolution was a contest for principle. Had the principle in<br>  question been yielded, who could have set limits to the acts of oppression<br>  growing out it ? So also in our war for sailors’ rights, the bone of<br>  contention was, the right of search and impressment. The mere fact that a few<br>  seamen had been injured and abused, was as nothing, aside from the principle<br>  involved. This, in common with that of the revolution, was a contest for<br>  principle, and the oppression resisted was the oppression of principle.

Not that Miss Crandall and a few colored Misses<br>  are subjected by it to certain shameful acts of cruelty and oppression.

For more on this pamphlet against smoking, it can be accessed online here:  https://www.gutenberg.org/files/24366/24366-h/24366-h.htm . Tim Crumrin's blog post, \"Noxious Weed,\" places Fowler's pamphlet in context -  https://www.vchsmuseum.org/post/noxious-weed . But in addition to this prescient struggle against tobacco, Fowler was a two-term Congressman, and an anti-slavery man. In an 1850 speech on the floor of the House, he spoke these memorable words about the despicable institution: <p><br>  “we must know what American slavery is. A constituent element is one thing, a<br>  relation is another thing, an appendage is another. What is the intrinsic, the<br>  unchanging, the essential element of American slavery? I answer, American<br>  slavery reduces man — a man created free, and equal to all other men — it<br>  reduces him to property. It makes free, moral agents, chattels. It converts<br>  persons into things — it sinks a rational creature into merchandise. An<br>  American slave can own nothing — can acquire nothing. Slavery annuls his right<br>  to himself. If he uses these terms — my hands, my eyes, my tongue, my body, my<br>  mind, myself— they are mere figures of speech. If an American slave uses<br>  himself for his own benefit, he commits a crime. If he keeps and appropriates<br>  what he earns, he is thereby a thief. To take his own body into his own<br>  keeping, is insurrection ; and death must be his doom for the deed, if he<br>  persevere. American slavery subjects men like ourselves, to be bartered,<br>  mortgaged, bequeathed, invoiced, shipped in cargoes, stored as other goods,<br>  taken on execution, as are cattle, and knocked off at public auction. It makes<br>  a man's rights — a man's deathless nature — a man's conscience, affections,<br>  sympathies, hopes — a marketable commodity. It robs him, not of privileges,<br>  but of himself. It loads him, not with burdens, but makes him a beast of<br>  burden. It restrains not liberty — it subverts it. It does not curtail rights<br>  — it abolishes them. In a word, American slavery sinks man into a machine —<br>  annihilates personality — despoils a human being of rational attributes —<br>  unmans a man. Such is American slavery.\"<br></p><p>Orin Fowler, <em><br>  Slavery in California and New Mexico: speech of Mr. Orin Fowler, of<br>  Massachusetts, in the House of Representatives, March 11, 1850 ...<br></em><br>&nbsp;[Washington, D.C.]: Buell &amp; Blanchard, 1850.</p> <p>The direct connection to the Burleighs comes much earlier in his career than this, though.  Fowler was a member of the Windham County Peace Society (Larned, Vol. II, p. 391), and when Fowler served at the Congregational Church in Plainfield, Rinaldo Burleigh (father of Charles and William) served as Deacon under him (Larned, Vol. II, p. 418) <br><br><br><br>"},{"pid":"obj271","identifier":"unionist--text-0271","title":"Advertisement for Godey's Lady Book","bibliographicCitation":"<em>The Unionist</em> 1834-03-13","bibliographicCitation.republished":null,"fullIssueSequenceNumber":"1834-03-13 p.03.35","creator":null,"_date.created":"1834-03-13","description":"Advertisement for Godey's Lady's Book","language":"English","publisher":"<em>The Unionist</em>","IsPartOf":null,"rights":"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/","source":"<em>The Unionist</em>","subject":"Advertisements","type":"Text","category":"Unionist full issue","article.type":null,"volume":"1","issue":"32","transcription":"<p>  THE LADY’S BOOK,  <em>    a monthly Magazine, of original and selected Tales, Poetry, Essays, and    Music, embellished with several hundred engravings, and quarterly plates of    the Philadelphia Fashions, superbly colored.  </em></p><p>  When, about four years ago, the Lady’s Book was submitted to the test of  publication; the proprietors made no professions likely to create expectations  which they could anticipate even an improbability of realizing: they were  determined nevertheless progressively to adopt every improvement which  diligent anxiety to please their patrons should suggest; and have now the  remunerating satisfaction, after having faithfully and steadily pursued their  course, of seeing it sanctioned by a circulation more extensive than that of  any other monthly journal in the United States, and as this extent of  patronage is the most admissible evidence of its past utility, it is offered  as the best guarantee for its future excellence.

STAPLES, DAVID PICKERING,  <em>Sub-Committee.</em></p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WATCHEMOKET  FARM, 30  <sup>th</sup>  Aug, 1833</p><p>  Dear Sir:—Among my political engagements, I have always found some leisure  moments left me for literary amusement. The employment of the School Master,  once so useful and dear to me, does now, at times, call me back to the  examination of letters, syllables, words, spellings and readings. Perhaps I  mingle with all these some political considerations; for I confess, that my  anxiety for the preservation and perpetuation of our Union and National  Government, is so great, that I often ardently wish all the children in the  United States could be taught to read from the same set of books. Not because  this might give a uniformity of pronunciation throughout the country, so  desirable to Poets and Orators; but more than this, because the same juvenile  literature studied and read, in the same language, would go far to give to  each succeeding generation not only the same knowledge, but something like a  brotherhood of feelings, sentiments, and opinions, than could, in any other  way be obtained. I know you as a citizen, feel a deep interest in all this;  and because you, as one of the highly useful and laborious fraternity of  Printers and venders of books, may have a peculiar interest in some of those  put forth for the instruction of children, I shall, at this time, press on  your attention this subject in connexion with the best which I have yet seen.</p><p>  Our worthy fellow-citizen, Mr. Oliver Angell, seems to have had purposes much  akin to my wishes, when he composed and published his system of classics for  children. He had named his books the “Union;” and if you look quite through  them, you will find nothing in the whole, for the reading of children, but  that spirit and those principles which alone can preserve the Union, the  purest morals, piety and patriotism. There is, also, a progression in the  readings found in these books, admirably contrived to go along with that of  the human mind in its growth from childhood up to perfect maturity.</p><p>  In mere orthography, the alphabet, the vowels, consonants, dipthongs,  syllables, spellings, perhaps Mr. Angell might have done better for the  <em>Instructor</em>  who may use his books; but after all, it will be found doubtful if any one can  do better for the  <em>Pupil</em>  for whom this good man seems alone to have been solicitous. The Instructor  should carry in his head, the correct pronunciation of every word in our  spoken language, and a key for all the various sounds of every letter in all  its various combinations whenever he looks at that language as it is printed  or written.</p><p>  We have more vowels in our spoken than in our printed or written language; and  those who compose spelling books have supplied the deficiency by figures added  to the printed character of each vowel. These Algebraic vowels, half letter,  half figure, used in spelling books, are not printed in books of any other  kind; so that a child, though he may have learned the different sounds of the  printed vowels and can pronounce them when he spells; yet when he comes to  read in other books, where one half of each vowel is omitted and it becomes  thereby a new letter, he knows not how to pronounce it; and he must, at last,  learn its different sounds in the different combinations of each with other  letters. This would have been easier done, at first, when he was spelling,  than, at last, when he is reading. Last or first, he must learn them, from the  Instructor, or from the dictionary; and the Algebraic vowels, called the key,  while useful to the Instructors themselves not well instructed, may be  detrimental to the pupil. On the whole, I have seen no system of School Books  equal, or any where near equal to Mr. Angell’s Union; and I think if they  could be universally used in our English Schools in the whole country, our  children would become not only better scholars, but better patriots, not less  citizens of Rhode-Island, or South-Carolina and more citizens of the United  States.</p><p>I am dear Sir, very truly, your obedient servant.</p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  TRISTAM BURGES.</p><p>  <em>From the Preceptors of the Public Schools in the City of Providence</em></p><p>  We have used Mr. Angell’s series of school books, for nearly one eyar; and  from this long trial we can say with confidence that we believe them admirably  suited to answer the purposes for which they were composed. From our  examination of the inferior numbers, which are used in the primary Schools, we  believe them also to be no less useful. As reading books, they all combine in  our opinion, many peculiar excellencies. The first, which will strike all who  use them, is their perfect  <em>adaptation</em>  to the  <em>capacities</em>  of those for whom they were designed. This, we consider a most important  advantage in an elementary book, and one which has not been heretofore  sufficiently attended to.</p><p>  The books put into the hands of children at school have generally been  altogether  <em>above the understanding</em>  of the young mind; and the consequence has been, that the scholars have noy  only made much less progress in a given time, but have acquired the lasting  <em>disgust</em>  for their studies which has operated as an effectual bar to future  improvement. To this great and extensive evil, Mr. Angell’s books afford a  <em>certain and easy remedy.</em>  The facility with which his lessons are  <em>understood</em>  added to their very interesting nature, causes them to be read by the scholar  with eagerness and delight; by which means his love of study and his  improvement in learning are both successfully promoted. The introduction of  spelling lessons, in connection with reading lessons, into all the books, is  an advantage which they possess over those previously in use. This  arrangement, by enabling the pupil to become acquainted with each separate  word, immediately before he is called to read them, is well calculated to  render that exercise correct and pleasing, at the same time that it renders  orthography a less dry and uninteresting study than the usual mode. It also  considerably promotes economy by rendering the purchase of a separate spelling  book unnecessary. The  <em>appending of questions</em>  to each reading lesson we consider a very valuable improvement, since, by  calling the attention of the pupil more closely to the subject, it will lead  him to a better understanding of what is read. The natural gradation from what  is easy, to what is more difficult, which is observed throughout this whole  series, is a circumstance that renders them peculiarly valuable. Entertaining  these opinions, we cheerfully recommend them to the attention of teachers and  others interested in the cause of education; confident, that to all who are  aware how much success in teaching depends upon proper books, they will be  peculiarly acceptable.

It is my intention, as soon as  practicable, to adopt the whole series as standard reading books for my  classes, and I doubt not that if the necessary exertions be made by those  interested, they will ere long become a favorite standard in all our schools.  I most cheerfully recommend them to the serious and immediate attention of my  Philadelphia co-laborers in the field of Education. Very respectfully—Your  ob’t Servant, J. O’CONNER. Principal of the Classical and English Academy,  rear of St. Stephen’s Church, and Recording Secretary of the “Philadelphia  Association of Teachers.”</p><p>  <em>    From Robert Vaux, Esq. of Philadelphia, who was for a number of years    President of the Board of Controllers of the Public Schools for the City and    County of Philadelphia.  </em></p><p>  TO MARSHALL, CLARK &amp; CO. SCHOOL BOOK PUBLISHERS, PHILADELPHIA. In  compliance with your request, I have examined “  <em>Angell’s Union Series of Common School Classics,”</em>  and entertain a very favorable opinion of the work. It comprises a course of  elementary lessons on simple and practical principles, and so far as I can  discover, imparts throughout, knowledge to instruct the understanding and to  purify the heart. In common with all productions of like character I could  wish for extensive circulation in our country. ROBERT VAUX.</p><p>  <em>    From Roswell C. Smith, Esq. Author of “Practical and Mental Arithmetic,”    “Productive Grammar,” “Introductory Arithmetic,” &amp;c.  </em></p><p>  From an impression, received and corroborated by a long continued course of  instruction, in regard to the best methods of communicating knowledge to the  youthful mind, I am free to confess that the Spelling and reading Books, of  which Mr. Oliver Angell is the author, are not excelled, in their adaption to  the purposes for which they are intended by any other books with which I am  acquainted. Their prominent characteristic is simplicity; and when the public  mind has taken the stand, to which it seems rapidly advancing, that children  and youth must understand what they read and what they learn, then at least  the works of Mr. Angell will receive that patronage, which they so eminently  deserve. This testimony in favor of that gentleman is designed not as a mere  puff; but as a just tribute of praise to one who has labored long and  faithfully for the public good. ROSWELL C.

[sic  no close parentheses]</p><p>  IN consequence of the light poured on the public, and the church, by the  spirited exertions of philanthropic individuals, a great change, in relation  to intoxicating liquors, has been produced. The eye, heart, and hand of  christian faith looks, prays, and acts for its completion.</p><p>  But another reformation is needed in the church. It must be as separate from  slavery, as from intemperance. The nation groans under the burden and misery  and guilt of both these sins. It is the solemn duty of the church to clear  itself from both these tremendous crimes. This is not addressed to the world,  for the world legalizes the traffic in rum, and in the bodies and souls of  men. But it is addressed to the children of God, who, if they know and do  their duty, can have no possible connection with either of these trades. If  increasing light has shown that christians ought not to buy and sell ardent  spirits, much more it is believed, will increasing light show that christians  ought not to buy human beings.</p><p>  The Rev. John Newton, even after he became pious, transported Africans in  chains across the Atlantic, to be sold with their posterity into slavery.  Could he have been a true christian, and have no upbraidings of conscience  while so engaged? Yes. How is it possible? It was legal, and, at that time,  honorable, and his mind was not enlightened.—Afterwards when it was he  lamented his error. So there are in our country those who buy and sell their  fellow beings, who, if their minds were enlightened, would lament and  relinquish it.</p><p>  A few years ago, a man, whose whole daily earnings were required by his  family, set up forty nights to run a distillery for forty dollars, which he  gave to build a house of worship.—How could he think that money obtained by  changing the bread of the poor, into the liquid fire of death, acceptable to  God? Because his mind was in darkness. Would he do it now? No. Neither would  the church now receive it. Why? Because the light of the temperance  reformation has burst forth.</p><p>  Christians! who have promised supreme obedience to Him, that :tasted death for  every man,: and more for the rich man, who, in a superb dress, rides in a  superb carriage, to a superb church, to worship in superb style, than for the  poor African, who pulls cotton in the “fields of Alabama, and naked as in the  hour of birth, trembles under the blasts of mid winter”—on you is this call  for a reformation in the church of that God, who declares himself no respector  [sic] of persons.—Why do you exclude the dealer in ardent spirits from the  communion table, and invite to it the dealer in human flesh? This could not,  would not be, if there had been half so much effort made to show the utter  abominations of christian slavery, as there has been to show the abominations  of christian drunkenness. Whatever maybe the event of slavery and intemperance  in the world a sufficiency of light will show, and cause to be removed  these&nbsp; shocking deformities of the christian church. One denomination has  already raised thousands of dollars to assist their brethren in becoming free  from the deep stains of this awful sin. When will other denominations be  equally sincere and active to cleanse themselves from this pollution? The  answer is plain. When they are as conscientious and as much enlightened.</p><p>  To have light poured on this subject as its importance demands, it is proposed  to raise fifty dollars, as a premium for the best essay on this deeply  interesting subject. When the church if pure, we may then expect the smiles  and approbation of heaven on our now almost divided land. And oh! May none  refuse their mite to reward the close application of time and talents to this  most vitally important theme; for it is believed the temperance reformation  commenced in this way.</p><p>  Donations will be received by the Editors of the Genius of Temperance, and the  Editor of the Emancipator, 126, Nassau street, A part of the money has already  been raised by a few ladies in Massachusetts. It is hoped that others, who are  opposed to slavery in the church of Christ, will speedily forward enough to  make it up to $50, when the sum will be given to him who shall show most  conclusively to the christian church and to christian ministers, their duty to  “Break every yoke.” The essays which shall be written for the prize, are to be  judged, and the premium awarded, by ________</p><p>[N.B.—The blank will be filled, when the money is subscribed.]</p><p></p>","Scholarly Notes":null,"Commentary":null},{"pid":"obj296","identifier":"unionist--text-0296","title":"Woodstock Academy","bibliographicCitation":"<em>The Unionist</em> 1834-03-13","bibliographicCitation.republished":null,"fullIssueSequenceNumber":"1834-03-13 p.04.60","creator":null,"_date.created":"1834-03-13","description":"Advertisement for Education","language":"English","publisher":"<em>The Unionist</em>","IsPartOf":null,"rights":"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/","source":"<em>The Unionist</em>","subject":"Advertisement with Education Theme","type":"Text","category":"Unionist full issue","article.type":null,"volume":"1","issue":"32","transcription":"<p align=\"center\"><em>WOODSTOCK ACADEMY.</em></p><p>  The fall term of this institution will commence on Wednesday the 30  <sup>th</sup>  of Oct.

The counsel for the prosecution claimed that the fire was  communicated from within and that it was done by Olney. The opposing counsel  insisted that the balance of proof was that the fire was communicated from  without, but whether from within or from without, no testimony whatever had  been adduced tending to show that Olney was guilty. The charge of his Honor  Judge EATON was brief, but distinguished for its ability and impartiality. The  jury retired, and after a short absence returned a verdict of  <em>not guilty.</em></p><p>  The trial occupied the court from 2 o’clock in the afternoon of Thursday, till  6 o’clock P.M. on Saturday.

WIRT.</p><p>  The Richmond Compiler of the 17  <sup>th</sup>  ult. contains an affecting account of the last illness of Mr. Wirt, written by  a gentleman who attended him through that illness. We proceed to extract the  principal part of it.—  <em>Free Elector</em></p><p>  “On the evening of Saturday, the 8  <sup>th</sup>  instant, he was in playful spirits, and sanguine of the success of an argument  which he was to make in court on Monday. He felt better satisfied with his  preparation, he said, than for any he had made for years before. On Sunday he  walked to the Capitol to Church—it was a damp, chilly day, and the  Representatives’ Hall was crowded and warm. To go immediately from it into the  cold, damp air, and walk slowly, as he did, a mile to his lodgings, might have  been deemed imprudent in one whose health was less precarious than his then  seemed.</p><p>  ”That night he complained of a slight indisposition, and in the family worship  of the evening prayed with an unusual fervor, and seemingly a foreboding  spirit which he communicated not save to his God. But even this was sufficient  to excite vague apprehensions in a family always ready to note and to dwell  upon whatsoever might seem to bode danger or safety to a friend so dear.</p><p>  On Monday he was confined to his room; no serious apprehensions were  entertained, but a physician was called in—it was only a cold. On Tuesday he  was worse, but we feared not the result. He complained of stiffness of the  muscles of the throat and swelling of the glands—milk poultices were applied  to his face, but they gave not relief. On Wednesday he was much worse so much  as to excite alarm; on the evening of this day it was first discovered that  the disease was Erysipelas, ”a new enemy,” of which Mr. Wirt then expressed  his fears. “It was not the foe with which he had been so long accustomed to  contend.”</p><p>  His constitution was too weak, as the physicians apprehended, to stand the  vigorous treatment which would have been most efficient in destroying the  disease. By Friday, the alarm had become very serious—the door was crowded by  anxious inquiring friends, and those who met in the street asked from each  other the latest intelligence. The affliction of the family was extreme, but  there was still hope. On Saturday, his daughter and son-in-law arrived from  Baltimore, and were shocked to find the case so much worse than their worst  fears.</p><p>  Scarcely a glimmer of hope was left to us, but this feeble ray was most  anxiously watched and cherished. When once shadowed by so deep a gloom, the  least of the twinkling stars in the firmament is more precious to our sight,  than is the sun itself in the noontide of an unclouded day.</p><p>  Death from the first day of his illness, had continued to approach with a  steady pace, and in a form more than usually hideous. The fine countenance so  bright with intellect, was sadly altered—by the disease partly, and partly by  remedies so fruitlessly applied. The eyes had lost their speculation—the  eloquent voice was hushed—the divinity had departed from the temple, and its  walls were defaced, but light still lingered, loath to abandon a habitation  which had so long given to a thing in itself so little desirable and so  worthless, beauty, purity, and worth.</p><p>  The attending physicians were Doctors Hunt and Hall; none could have been more  anxiously attentive; the latter staid by him every night of the last four or  five.</p><p>  About noon on Monday, consciousness returned; and he had power to speak a few  words. Nature had made a last effort to permit him to take leave of his family  and friends, to give them assurance that he died in christian hope, and to  join them in prayer to his God. The Rev. Mr. Post officiated. In so much of  the prayer as related to his family and his own acceptance with heaven, he  seemed heartily to join—but when a petition was offered that he might be  restored to health, he audibly dissented “no, no!” He had done and suffered  enough in this contentious world, and was entitled to the release and the  transfer to a higher existence, which the good and just are authorized to  expect.</p><p>  It was now become manifest, even to the most sanguine, that recovery was  beyond the remotest probability. He was too shining a mark for death longer to  miss. All that was left to us was to smooth his passage to the tomb—to moisten  his parched lips and tongue, and perform such little offices of affection as  might soothe his last sufferings.</p><p>  During the last eighteen hours, he was tranquil as a child. Breathing and  warmth were the only evidence of life—no motion, no pain, no consciousness,  there lay the wreck of WILLIAM WIRT.</p><p>  Three friends besides the clergymen attended his bedside during the night—his  family to, worn as they were by nearly a week’s constant watching, could not  be induced to take repose. Anguish and affection gave them strength to bear  what would have exhausted the strongest men It was a night long to be  remembered—a night of silent, despairing sorrow, which conveys to the heart a  language never to be forgot, a language which is not for a pen like mine to  transcribe.</p><p>  Tuesday morning breaks upon the scene still unaltered, save that life  fluttered more faintly and all pulse was gone. About 11 o’clock the breathing  became gradually more distant and more feeble—was suspended or  imperceptible—another breath—he’s gone! So calm, so imperceptibly did he make  his exit, that the precise moment of his departure could scarcely be  marked—without a sign or a struggle his bright spirit has departed from  amongst us to a state o existence higher, mightier, and more glorious.</p><p>  Upon a highly excited mind a slight incident will sometimes make a deep and  lasting impression. As the last flickerings of life were failing—while his  whole family, and the friends who had watched with them, were grouped around  his bed, and In silent, deep attention to the awful scene, all held their  breath, and their hearts and pulse stood still, a few soft, low notes from a  pet bird, which had before been so silent that its presence in the room was  unremarked, fell with startling sweetness on the ear. Only once before during  his illness, had it been known to sing. On the preceding day,, at the  conclusion of the last act of devotion in which he ever joined, these same  soft notes had mingled with the solemn ‘Amen.’</p><p></p>","Scholarly Notes":null,"Commentary":"William Wirt (1772-1834) was a long-serving Attorney General of the United States, but is best-remembered today for defending the rights of the Cherokees in the case that later so sadly spiraled down into the Trail of Tears.

He introduced among  barbarians the arts and the courtesies of civilized life—and he paved the way  to the grandeur of the Russian Empire. His name is never mentioned by a  Russian but with the utmost veneration and respect.

He facilitated communication through the different parts of his  immense Empire by making public roads, some of which were upwards of  <em>one thousand miles in length!</em>  He established manufactories of various kinds—the first of which was pins.

After marriage the husband never allowed the  wife to be seated at the same table with him—he could even kill her with  impunity. On the other hand, a woman who murdered her husband was sentenced to  be buried alive!

A surgeon in the army, named Dautun, was arrested in a  gambling house, in the Palais Royal, on the testimony of a scar on his wrist.  Some time previous, the officers of the night had found while passing their  rounds, in different parts of the city, four parcels tied up; one containing  the head, another the trunk, a third the thighs, and a fourth the legs and  arms of a man. In the teeth, tightly compressed, was a piece of human flesh,  apparently torn out in the dying struggle. The parts were collected, and put  together in their regular order, and exhibited for a number of days at the  Morgue. The mystery which involved this dark transaction excited quite an  interest, and numbers went to see the corpse. The general and only conviction  was the he must have been murdered; but for a number of weeks no clue was  obtained to elicit information on the subject. When it became at length  improper to keep the body any longer above ground, a cast in plaster was  taken, fully representing the murdered victim, and this remained a much longer  time for the public to see. At length Dauton happened to be engaged in  gambling at the Palais Royal; he played high and lost, called for liquor to  drink, and angry because the waiter was somewhat tardy, when he came with it  Dauton emptied the glass and threw it at the waiter. It was shivered into a  thousand pieces, and a fragment was carried into Dautun’s wrist, // under the  cuff of his coat. The spectators gathering around, and learning the accident,  wished to see the gash; he drew down his sleeve, and firmly pressed it round  his wrist; they insisted on seeing it, he obstinately refused. By this course,  the bystanders were at length led to suppose that something mysterious was  involved in this conduct, and they determined at all events to see his wrist.  By force they pushed up his sleeve, and behold a scar recently healed, as if  made by tearing out of flesh, appeared. The landlord had been at Morgue, and  seen the murdered man with the flesh between the teeth, and it struck him in a  moment that the flesh was torn from this man’s wrist. Charging them to keep  him safe, he hastened to call in the legal authorities, and arrested him.</p><p>  In the event, Dautun confessed that being quartered at Sedan, and out of  money, he came to Paris to try some adventure. Knowing that his brother had a  large sum by him, directly on his arrival, he went to his lodgings in a  retired part of the city, about eight in the evening. He entered the house  unnoticed by the porter, and passing to his apartment, found his brother  asleep. He immediately commenced the work of death; his brother waking up  defended himself, but in addition to the surprise and horror of the moment,  being in a feeble state of health, all the desperation of his struggle was  overpowered. In the scuffle he tore out the flesh. Being killed, the surgeon  cut up the body, tied it up in four parcels as before mentioned, secured the  money and retired.</p><p>  He also confessed that eleven months previous he had murdered an aunt, who was  living with a second husband, to obtain money. Her husband was arrested and  imprisoned for a number of months, but as nothing appeared to criminate him,  he had been discharged. The writer saw the unhappy fratricide on his way from  the prison to the place of execution.</p>","Scholarly Notes":"Check if you can add a picture from the link","Commentary":"Original of this memoir
