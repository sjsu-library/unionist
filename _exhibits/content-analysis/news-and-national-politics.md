The Unionist</em> was published during the tumultuous second term of President Andrew Jackson, and it was a decidedly anti-Jacksonian paper. Every complete issue makes this evident, with support for Whig and Anti-Masonic candidates, and fulminating against the President’s position in the Banking crisis. Of course, most of the opponents of the Canterbury Female Academy – such as Andrew Judson, Philip Pearl, and James Holbrook, editor of the <em>Windham Advertiser</em> - were Jacksonian Democrats. However opposed the Abolitionists were to the anti-Abolitionist President Jackson and his uncouth ways and followers, it was precisely this Jacksonian populism that enriched the “media environment” with more newspapers and more robust discussion.

<em>The Unionist</em> covered some major news stories, and followed the journalistic procedure of reprinting short notices from other newspapers. Due to the connection with Arthur Tappan, <em>The Unionist</em> was also tied in to the evangelical press in New York, giving it access to stories from <em>The Genius of Temperance</em> and the <em>Chinese Repository</em>, the latter being an organ of Protestant missionaries in China.
