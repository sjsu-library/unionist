<p><em>The Unionist</em> formed a part of the reading material available to the African-American women students at the Canterbury Female Academy. This important fact – consistent with Black community reading practices in the early nineteenth-century – meant that these students were absorbing some of the most important rhetorical, political, and pacifist ideas of the time. Politically, the letter from William Jay (son of the first Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, John Jay) about the history of Black civil rights in America would have been a signal to the students that there were some prominent white men confirming the heritage they had learned from the parents and grandparents – of Black participation in the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812, of voting rights, of passports and citizenship rights. News from the Caribbean confirmed that Haitian Independence and the British Emancipation of 1833 had been successful and were being actively sustained. The writings of Lydia Maria Child, one of the most prominent anti-racist white women in the Abolitionist movement, were available from the office of the <em>Unionist</em>, and contained material about the Canterbury Female Academy itself. She pointed out how the laws protecting the institution of slavery limit every opportunity for self-improvement by free Blacks – as every student in that school knew viscerally. Child’s writing has a feminist dimension, both implicitly and explicitly, modeling female literary achievement (she was already a famous fiction and self-help writer before becoming a committed Abolitionist). Finally, the students were reading – ahead of its availability to most of the American public – the pacifist theories of Jonathan Dymond (1796-1828). This English Quaker and linen-draper wrote an influential text of moral philosophy, praised by voices as disparate as Swinburne, Leo Tolstoy, Henry David Thoreau, and William Lloyd Garrison. Twentieth-century historian Peter Brock considered Dymond’s exposition of the Quaker Peace Testimony to be the most significant philosophic attempt to universalize that doctrine. There was an active Peace Society in Windham County, which caught up with Dymond long before his work was published in the United States; the Windham County Peace Society, led by Crandall’s ally Samuel J. May, issued a pamphlet by Dymond on the subject of peace. One of the complete issues of <em>The Unionist</em> contains a full essay on government from Dymond’s larger exposition on ethics. It is obvious from the context that this essay was part of a series in <em>The Unionist</em>. What this means is that the African-American women at the Canterbury Female Academy were reading the latest radical philosophic material – from white American lawyers, from white American women Abolitionists, and from a white British pacifist. The availability of Black philosophic writings, though, was a gap which will be discussed in a later essay.</p>
