<p>Anti-racist politics rarely run smoothly, because the reason the anti-racism is necessary stems from the lack of living, fruitful contact between the races. The white Abolitionists were the first major group of white people to take the task and magnitude of anti-racism seriously. The African-American Rev. Theodore Wright, one of the endorsers of the Canterbury Female Academy, stated that white “Abolitionists must annihilate in their own bosoms the cord of caste.” Samuel J. May indicated that Crandall had done that, but feared (correctly) that her white neighbors had not: “Some may here wish to ask why Miss Crandall did not first consult her patrons, the parents of those, who were already in her school? Her answer is, She foresaw that there would be the same kind of opposition in their bosoms, which she had quelled in her own. Their opinions and feelings could not help her to decide what was her duty.” Most of the serious missteps happen early in the print run of <em>The Unionist</em>, but given how much material we lack, any such extrapolation is hinged with uncertainty. The errors into which the paper falls include patronizing language, stereotyping the passive, gentle slave (what would later be called “Uncle Tom-ism”), and assuming that once enslaved people were free, they would adopt Western civilization wholesale.</p>
