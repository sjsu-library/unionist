The idea for <em>The Unionist</em> was born from a surprise visit that Arthur Tappan made to Windham county, to see how the Canterbury experiment was proceeding. He visited the school, and then spent time with Samuel J. May. When Tappan asked May what was most urgently needed, May suggested that a newspaper would help to bring out the genuine range of opinion in the area. But who would edit it?

Tappan recalled a small editorial from the <em>Genius of Temperance</em>. This New York City based publication was part of the developing evangelical wing of Abolitionism, edited by William Goodell. The May 15, 1833 issue included a brief article under the title “The Canterbury Affair.” It provides the ‘official’ petition from April 1, 1833, against the Academy for Black Women. But this piece from the white elites of Canterbury is followed by a strong radical, insightful, sardonic commentary. On target against the pretended patriotism of the Canterbury cabal, it ends with the author hinting that he does not “believe a majority of the citizens of Canterbury favor such “wild schemes.”” This was Charles C. Burleigh’s first printed commentary on “the Canterbury Affair.” It typifies his two-fold approach: withering sarcastic contempt for the pretensions of white supremacist positions, and confidence in the people, broadly conceived, to demonstrate more humane good sense.

Charles Burleigh’s recruitment to Abolitionism echoes the calling of Peter and James to apostleship (or, the recruitment of Odysseus to the Trojan War). Samuel J. May vaguely remembered the name of Charles Burleigh, and decided to check on this youngster as a potential editor for a pro-Crandall newspaper. Arriving at Rinaldo and Lydia Burleigh’s farm, he was informed that Charles “was in the field as busy as he could be.” But May insisted that his mission trumped the importance of haying, and so Charles came in from his manual labor. Samuel J. May described the first sight he had of Burleigh with a Biblical reference:

> At the hard, hot work of haying, he was not attired in his Sunday clothes, but in his shirt-sleeves, with pants the worse for wear; and, although he then believed in shaving, no razor had touched his beard since the first day of the week. Nevertheless, I do not believe that Samuel of old saw, in the ruddy son of Jesse, as he came up from the sheepfold, the man whom the Lord would have him anoint, more clearly that I saw C.C. Burleigh the man whom I should choose to be my assistant in that emergency. So soon as I had told him what I wanted of him, his eye kindled as if eager for the conflict.

The effectively lucky choice of Charles Burleigh to edit a newspaper turned out to be fortuitous indeed; not only did he prove effective at this through The Unionist, but he went on to hold editorial posts throughout his life. The other theme that May drops here in the description of this initial meeting, is the humor that so many Abolitionists found in Charles’ appearance. His preference for casual clothes and long hair became increasingly more pronounced, and, in suitable abolitionist fashion, ideologically defended by him. Commentators on his career as an Abolitionist lecturer always noted his likeness to an Old Testament prophet.
