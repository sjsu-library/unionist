<p>The white opposition in Canterbury was led by Andrew Judson, a member of the Connecticut Assembly; he received steadfast support from lawyer Rufus Adams and other Select Men of Canterbury. When Black students started to arrive in early April 1833, these white men tried to enforce old vagrancy laws, even threatening to whip one of the young women students. But then they decided instead to pass a new law – now known as the Connecticut Black Law – making it illegal to teach free Blacks from out-of-state. The Black Law was a serious challenge to the existence of the Academy, but Crandall and her allies decided to defy and oppose it. This resulted in Crandall being arrested; she spent a night in jail. This incident is referred to in many places in <em>The Unionist</em>. As the Abolitionists prepared for Crandall’s trial under the Black Law, they were increasingly aware of an information gap – what today we would lament as a glut of “fake news.”. The <em>Norwich Courier</em>, the influential <em>Columbian Register</em> of New Haven, and pre-eminently the local <em>Windham County Advertiser</em> in Brooklyn, Connecticut – the town just north of Canterbury – were all virulently anti-Abolitionist, pro-Colonizationist, and vociferously opposed to the advanced education of Black women in Canterbury. There were no major dissenting voices in the local press. All three of these papers would engage with <em>The Unionist</em> in editorial exchanges and ripostes.</p>
